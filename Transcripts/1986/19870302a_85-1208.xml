            <text syncTime="27.115" offset="252903">This case involves the issue of whether and under what circumstances an employer, purchasing the assets of a defunct business enterprise, must recognize a labor union which represented the employees of its predecessor, the former assets owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.593" offset="322807">It is to be distinguished immediately from those cases in which a going business was purchased, substantially intact and operational, and in which the new owner retained or quickly employed a majority of the employees of the former assets owner.</text>

            <text syncTime="84.820" offset="483721">This Court must decide whether Fall River should be considered a successor for the purposes of collective bargaining when the employees of its predecessor constituted a minority of all of the employees of Fall River at the full complement date, but also when the employees of the predecessor constituted a majority at an earlier date, the substantial complement date.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.923" offset="600123">We have some guidance from this Court in how to approach this particular issue, and if I may quote very briefly from the opinion of this Court in howard Johnson: this Court held that the real question in each of these successorship cases is on the particular facts, what are the legal obligations of the new employer to the employees of the former owner or their representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.608" offset="718823">The answer to this, according to this Court, requires an analysis of the interests of the new employer and the employees, and of the policies of the labor laws in light of the facts of each case and the particular legal obligation which is at issue, whether it be the duty to recognize and bargain with the union, the duty to remedy unfair labor practices, et cetera.</text>

            <text syncTime="436.494" offset="1890363">The problem in this case is that there is an underlying assumption here that at the time of the demand, at the time that the demand was made at this case, and the time that the measuring period was applied, in this case by the Board, the substantial complement date which was seven months at least from the time of the closing of this plant and the laying off of 150 employees, that representation wishes of the former employees of Sterlingwale had not changed and that is completely unsupported by the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="508.024" offset="2176456">Here, not only was there no certification but over a bargaining history of more than 20 years, there is no evidence in the record that there was recognition based on any showing of majority support.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.933" offset="2228074">The assumption, or presumption that we start with a majority in this time carryover rests entirely on a collective bargaining agreement which has a union security provision which requires all employees to be members of the union 30 days after their employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1065.481" offset="4406268">Sterlingwale was defunct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.831" offset="4411702">The record shows that the company was formed, I believe on August 31st.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.218" offset="4433227">That is when the Certificate of Incorporation was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.087" offset="4444721">All of these things happened simultaneously, and the documents in the record indicate... It's a rather complex situation there... that Fall River had the right to acquire these assets at a particular price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.513" offset="4502399">And what we have here, really, is an assets purchaser, not interested in the employees as employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.916" offset="4528103">Fall River made no attempt to go after the employees of Sterlingwale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.487" offset="4558301">It didn't obtain their personnel records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.706" offset="4571258">It didn't obtain any lists of where to locate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.241" offset="4585364">When it needed employees it advertised in the newspaper and that's where it got its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.978" offset="4608352">It also hired employees of other finishing companies In the Fall River area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.216" offset="4633220">And this distinguishes this case very, very much from cases such as Howard Johnson and Burns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.135" offset="4664881">Here, after employees, 150 production employees being out of work With no real anticipation of ever being rehired, they see a newspaper ad from a completely new employer and that's how they became part of the personnel of Fall River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.866" offset="4747845">I think I would like to make a point here about the representation wishes of the former Sterlingwale employees, because again this lies at the heart of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.274" offset="4793507">What happened in this situation was that when Sterlingwale went out of business it owed premiums for life insurance and health insurance for the bargaining unit employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.766" offset="4843454">It hadn't paid them, and any of those employees who wanted to continue that coverage had to pay it for themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.670" offset="4867068">It also didn't pay severance pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.637" offset="4874905">It also didn't pay vacation pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.039" offset="4884518">In the interim, in the several months while Fall River was... excuse me, while Sterlingwale was in control, money came in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.745" offset="4923388">The Sterlingwale Company was undergoing a slow liquidation and the money was used to pay taxes and other creditors, and even when the assets were sold at the end, the unencumbered assets at the end of August of 1982, none of that money went towards paying the employee benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.158" offset="5004995">So, in the following year when the National Labor Relations Board hearings were coming up the employees, the former employees of Sterlingwale heard about this and they repudiated the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.818" offset="5055672">Factually, without any presumptions being used, they repudiated the union one they had the former secretary... I shouldn't say the former... the secretary of the union circulate two petitions, one to former Sterlingwale employees and one to new employees who were non-Sterlingwale employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.064" offset="5140623">Those petitions are part of the record, and they say clearly that those employees do not want to be represented by Sterlingwale... pardon me, by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.420" offset="5178030">And the reason is very clear from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.956" offset="5188165">The reason is that the union did not get the employees the benefits that be longed to them under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.062" offset="5220662">That is a very good reason for repudiating a union, and that right is guaranteed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1608.495" offset="6578402">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.972" offset="6628244">The union selected by the members of an appropriate bargaining unit is ordinarily presumed to continue to represent the unit unless and until there is either an employee petition to the Board for a change or the employer can demonstrate by objective considerations that it has some reasonable grounds for believing that the union has last its majority status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.770" offset="6727509">The reason for this indefinitely continuing presumption, as the Court re-emphasized last term in the Financial Institution Employees case, is that after the initial selection the law greatly prefers stable and continuous collective bargaining to management electioneering, and that it therefore generally bars re-visiting the representation issue unless and until there is affirmative reason to believe that the union no longer commands majority support.</text>

            <text syncTime="3139.903" offset="12704012">The petitions which were put together on April 29, three days before this hearing, were quite clearly identified in the testimony as having been produced by a fear that this very proceeding would take three years and that the employees would not get a raise until it was over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.606" offset="12822817">In addition the ALJ properly rejected those petitions on the ground that petitions signed on April 29 did not have a bearing on the issue that was before him, which was the obligation to bargain as of January 15th.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.420" offset="12902020">The Board's treatment of the union's demand as a continuing one, and as therefore outstanding on January 15 was, I think, correct as a matter of fact in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.578" offset="12954683">There is no doubt in anyone's mind, was no doubt on January 15th that the union was in fact still demanding recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.582" offset="12986761">There is no reason to require a union to keep sending demands as the employer staffs up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.901" offset="13011943">And there is nothing wrong with the Board's sanctioning a procedure under which the union makes a demand when the employer starts operations, and that demand, if not ripe at the outset, attaches whenever the employer who is in the best position to determine the facts has achieved the requisite complement of employees, if the requisite continuity of both the enterprise and the bargaining unit are then present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.190" offset="13133152">The employer can, I repeat, and is in the best position to determine when he is in substantially normal operation and has a representative complement as it has been defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.703" offset="13219251">The suggestion in the briefs that he has to worry about jumping the gun in that situation seems to me to be... and suffering an 8-A-2 violation seems to me to be farfetched and there never has been an 8-A-2 charge in any such situation, recognizing the union that had represented the employees of his predecessor and there is a majority in the unit at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.753" offset="13327398">And there is, with the tolerable certainty that is the best we can expect in any such situation, I think, a workable ability to determine when a substantial and representative complement has been achieved.</text>
