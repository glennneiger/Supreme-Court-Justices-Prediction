            <text syncTime="12.042" offset="198175">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.839" offset="209460">At the time of the offense Chris Burger and his older co-indictee were privates in the United States Army stationed at Ft Stewart, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.912" offset="253659">They were drinking heavily at a club on base, and when they ran out of money, the co-indictee devised a plan where they would rob a cab driver to obtain some more money.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.125" offset="294515">The cab was called out to the base, and after riding with the cab driver for awhile, on a prearranged signal, the robbery was accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.186" offset="326802">After the robbery was accomplished, the co-indictee forced the cab driver into the back seat of the cab where he sexually assaulted him, and the cab driver was forced by the co-indictee into the trunk of the cab.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.682" offset="372778">Chris and the co-indictee continued driving to the Savannah, Georgia airport, where they went to pick up a fellow soldier who was flying home... was flying back to the base from his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.521" offset="420112">This fellow soldier is the only uninvolved eye witness to any of the incidents which occurred that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.143" offset="446652">This fellow soldier testified that during the ride from the Savannah, Georgia airport back to the base, the co-indictee was essentially gloating and bragging about the crime, while Chris essentially was driving the cab silently, occasionally agreeing with some of the statements that the co-indictee was making.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.182" offset="522825">When the co-indictee during the drive suggested that they should kill the cab driver, Chris argued against this and said that they should just release the cab driver and get rid of the cab.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.662" offset="564726">After the... after the fellow soldier was dropped off at the base, they continued riding in the cab for a period of time, and then the co-indictee directed Chris to drive the cab to an area in the woods in rural Wayne County, Georgia, that both he and Chris were familiar with.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.106" offset="646437">The cab was parked at a pond at... in the woods.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.073" offset="662319">The co-indictee then removed the CB radio from the front of the cab, and taking the CB radio to dispose of it in some bushes.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.945" offset="701816">During this time, Chris opened up the trunk of the cab and asked the cab driver if he was all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.317" offset="723341">After receiving an affirmative reply, he closed the trunk of the cab.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.285" offset="739223">By this time, the co-indictee had returned to the cab and Chris began to walk away, and the co-indictee asked him, where are you going?</text>
            <text syncTime="156.171" offset="774750">And Chris said, we're leaving now, aren't we?</text>
            <text syncTime="158.140" offset="782587">And the co-indictee said, no, we've got to get rid of the cab, and directed Chris to drive the cab into the water, which he did, resulting in the death of the cab driver.</text>

            <text syncTime="186.909" offset="897734">The order in which I'd like to address the issues before this Court is the failure of Chris' trial counsel to conduct reasonable investigation, a reasonable inquiry for the sentencing phase of trial; then the pervasive conflict of interest that existed in this case; and then the burden-shifting jury instruction on malice and intent that was given at the guilt-innocence phase of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.899" offset="993656">The most important consideration in the death sentence which Chris received in this case is that this death sentence is not reliable as society's reasoned moral response to Chris' individualized background.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.784" offset="1057186">Chris was twice tried in Wayne County, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.736" offset="1072964">After the first trial, the Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed the conviction but reversed the death sentence, sending the case back for retrial solely on the issue of sentencing, and he was again sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.842" offset="1117477">At both of these trials, the jury had absolutely no knowledge of the individualized characteristics of Chris or his background other than the state's version of the crime for which he was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.491" offset="1180066">They knew only the crime that was committed they did not know the person they were sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.442" offset="1199814">In making what this Court has referred to as the unique, difficult, individualized, subjective decision which the jury must make at sentencing, this difficult decision was rendered impossible by the fact that they had absolutely no knowledge of the background of the person they were sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.905" offset="1269718">There's a wealth of information that a reasonably informed attorney would want to have presented before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.760" offset="1301065">There's a wealth of information that a reasonably informed attorney would have wanted to consider as potential mitigating circumstances to be presented at the sentencing phase of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.600" offset="1340458">Some of these potential mitigating circumstances, which a reasonably informed attorney would have wanted to have presented, were established at the Federal evidentiary hearing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.737" offset="1381000">Chris had absolutely no prior record.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.454" offset="1391867">He was 17 years old at the time of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.765" offset="1405137">But more than just his chronological age, he had an IQ in the lower 10 percent of the population.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.747" offset="1429065">He was suffering from brain damage, most probably caused by blows to his head when he was young.</text>

            <text syncTime="348.752" offset="1545049">He spent the rest of his youth being kicked back and forth between two parents who wanted to have nothing to do with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.922" offset="1569708">His father would not want him to live with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.388" offset="1579635">He'd throw him out of the house, send him to live with his mother, who also wanted to have nothing to do with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.261" offset="1599070">And as soon as the opportunity arose, she'd kick him out of the house and send him back to live with his natural father.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.072" offset="1618296">He was physically and psychologically abused by his natural father, and when he came back to living with his mother and with a stepfather, this stepfather introduced him to drug abuse and alcohol abuse at the age of 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.582" offset="1672422">He was physically beaten by this stepfather, and his mother was also physically beaten by the stepfather.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.767" offset="1701157">When he tried to intervene in the beatings that his mother was receiving at the hands of his stepfather, he would be beaten for trying to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.703" offset="1728846">Chris was then sent back to live with his natural father.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.184" offset="1746819">And because of the physical abuse he was suffering there, he ran away from home, trying to hitchhike to Florida to live with his mother who had moved to Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.977" offset="1781927">After hitchhiking from Indiana to Florida and arriving in Florida broke at his mother's home, she told him he wasn't wanted and threw him out of the house and sent his back again to live with his natural father, who also locked him out of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.707" offset="1832918">So for the last few months before his enlistment in the Army, he was forced to live with a neighbor who took him in because he had nowhere else to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.080" offset="1862384">Not one word of this individualized background of Chris was heard by either one of the juries that sentenced him to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.326" offset="1891328">Under the... the death penalty scheme in Georgia, only one juror is required to impose a sentence of life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.572" offset="1924347">If one juror had been persuaded by the mitigating evidence in this case, Chris would have received... if one reasonable fact-finder on that jury had been persuaded... Chris would have received a sentence of life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.317" offset="1975338">This is not a case of second guessing some strategic or tactical decision that was made by his trial attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="839.552" offset="3508308">But we're talking about this terrible background of child abuse and mental-deficiency from which Chris came.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.362" offset="3535475">An important factor of this is that after the original death sentence was reversed by the Supreme Court of Georgia, the case was remanded for retrial, solely on the issue of sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.466" offset="3595974">And it was remanded in September, and the case was not retried until July of the following year.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.291" offset="3623246">So the attorney, knowing that all considerations of guilt-innocence were gone now, the Supreme Court of Georgia had affirmed the conviction, and knowing the case was coming back solely on the issue of sentencing, and having nine months to prepare for it, he testified that during that nine months he conducted no investigation for the sentencing phase of trial; that during that nine months he interviewed no witnesses for the sentencing phase of trial; he testified that he simply opened up his file, reviewed the file, and decided to try the case the same way he had before, which he knew had failed the first time he'd tried it.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.106" offset="3754486">Exacerbating this problem of the failure of the counsel to conduct any sort of reasonable inquiry for sentencing in this case is the pervasive conflict of interest that existed in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1678.420" offset="6863788">The essence of the defense being lesser culpability, and that Chris was under the direction and domination of his co-indictee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.151" offset="6898688">The important thing that the jury had to decide in making a decision whether the requisite malice and intent existed was not determining whether the intent was formulated by some 30-year-old adult, but whether or not the intent... the... the requisite intent was formulated by a 17-year-old operating at the thought processes of a 12-year-old.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.000" offset="6998058">And this decision about Chris' formulation of intent was taken away from the jury by an instruction that told them that they are to presume that malice and intent exists from the natural and probable consequences of any life-threatening acts which Chris may have committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.479" offset="7060020">After Furman v. Georgia, the Georgia legislature enacted a bifurcated system for capital trials, establishing a sentencing phase where a complete portrait of the person to be sentenced is presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.770" offset="7117176">Especially in the case of a 17-year-old, we want to be certain that the fact-finders on the jury make the sentencing determination with adequate knowledge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1760.980" offset="7193976">But the jury's entire knowledge of his background, their entire knowledge of his background consisted of the state's version of a few hours of one day of this life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.586" offset="7236399">And the reason that was the state's entire knowledge of his background was because he was not provided with the counsel which our Constitution requires.</text>

            <label>Mr. William B. Hill, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1800.355" offset="7351442">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.353" offset="7379446">First I'll address myself to petitioner's claims of a violation of the Sixth Amendment rights, and then I'll address myself to the correctness of the trial court's charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.553" offset="7416226">In this case petitioner claims that his trial counsel labored under a conflict of interest, and that this conflict manifested itself in two respects... only two respects identified by this petitioner from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.018" offset="7462097">And that is, the alleged shortcomings of trial counsel in not offering this petitioner's testimony against his co-indictee in exchange for a sentence less than death; and trial counsel's alleged failure, because of this conflict of interest, not arguing alleged lesser culpability on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.151" offset="7530642">One thing I'd like to make clear to this Court before I proceed further is the respondent's position with reference to this conflict of interest claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.398" offset="7563661">And the respondent's position is, as found by the District Court... and the District Court in this case was the fact-finder; the evidentiary development was in that Federal court, not in a state court... the District Court found, under the facts of this case, no joint representation, no conflict of interest, and no adverse affect on counsel's representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.218" offset="7642969">Now moving directly to those only two respects in which this petitioner contends that this conflict manifested itself in adverse effects on counsel's representation, though counsel here would have you to believe that because of a conflict of interest, Mr. Leaphart did not offer Christopher Burger's testimony against his co-indictee, the actual facts reveal that Mr. Leaphart at all times, prior to trial, and in that interim period of time between the decision on direct appeal which reversed the first death sentence, and the trial... the retrial on sentencing, Mr. Leaphart attempted to engage in plea negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.938" offset="7793852">Now Mr. Leaphart was experienced trial counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.484" offset="7803988">He had litigated in this area for some 15 years; had tried 10 to 12 death penalty cases; and had been litigating against the same district attorney for eight years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1947.987" offset="7942019">This was a death penalty case, an extremely heinous death penalty case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1957.608" offset="7980471">And Mr. Leaphart attempted to engage in plea negotiations with Glen Thomas, this district attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.809" offset="8001264">But the unrefuted testimony in the record... unrefuted... is that the district attorney flatly refused to open any avenues for plea negotiations; thus plea negotiations were never engaged in; and Mr. Leaphart never had the opportunity to make any type of offer, however characterized by this petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="2002.247" offset="8159044">This is a south Georgia community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.916" offset="8169702">And counsel who routinely represent death row inmates, as does my opponent here at the bar who I've litigated against for some 10 years, one of the things you consider is that in a small community like this that's usually rural in nature, death penalty cases cost money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.456" offset="8231873">And after reversal on the first appeal, maybe you can incline the district attorney to take a plea to a life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.141" offset="8258623">Mr. Leaphart tried to do this in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.202" offset="8270848">But the district attorney refused to even discuss it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.436" offset="8279834">So the facts in this record reflect that there was no offer of a plea not because of some conflict of interest, but because the district attorney opened no channels for communication.</text>

            <text syncTime="2276.197" offset="9254828">This psychologist retained by trial counsel evaluated the defendant and informed Mr. Leaphart that Mr. Burger had an IQ of 82, and that Mr. Burger could distinguish right from wrong at the time of the offense; that Mr. Burger was a sociopath; that Mr. Burger, to quote the psychologist's language, was as compelled to do evil as a minister was to do good, that Mr. Burger was prone to hurt people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.060" offset="9366319">Mr. Leaphart knew this to be the testimony of the psychologist that he had retained, and this testimony was previewed at the Jackson Denno hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.854" offset="9397457">And Mr. Leaphart made the decision that that type testimony, though favorable to his client with reference to his IQ, was too detrimental in other respects, especially if the psychologist was going to be subjected to a thorough and sifting cross-examination by the district attorney, which under Georgia law, is not limited to issues delved in on direct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2357.649" offset="9580628">The only other respect in which counsel contends, or petitioner contends, that trial counsel representation was adversely affected by this conflict of interest was counsel's alleged failure, because of the conflict, not to argue lesser culpability on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.096" offset="9646456">Now what the record evidence reflects is that Mr. Leaphart testified... keeping in mind that Mr. Leaphart was the attorney who got the original death vacated... he testified at the conclusion of the retrial on sentencing, he perused the transcript and the record, and he raised every meritorious issue on appeal he could identify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.604" offset="9724510">He specifically testified that while in his judgment an argument of less culpability under the facts of this case was palatable when presented to a jury and in the imaginative form in which he did, when the facts actually reflected that his client was the killer, the actual killer, it would have been frivolous to argue lesser culpability to the Georgia Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.268" offset="9811132">He testified that was his reason for not raising that allegation, which relieves this Court of any necessity to speculate as to some conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.294" offset="9847286">That testimony is unrefuted in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.121" offset="9858570">What the facts in this case reveal is that this petitioner was afforded an opportunity at the Federal evidentiary hearing to present facts in support of his claims of a conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.602" offset="9896500">He has not done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.789" offset="9901202">The facts in this record, nor prevailing constitutional principles, would afford him relief on this claim, and the District Court and the Circuit Court so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.285" offset="9939237">Secondly, this petitioner contends that trial counsel was ineffective for not presenting potentially damaging character evidence on the sentencing phase of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.376" offset="9975599">Now this is not a case in which trial counsel did not present mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.372" offset="9995557">From the very presentation of the first witness of any substance by the prosecution, Mr. Leaphart began developing mitigating evidence on behalf of Christopher Burger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.540" offset="10036203">On cross-examining Mr. Botsford, he brought out the fact that Mr. Burger was 17 years old at the time of the crime, and his co-indictee was 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.553" offset="10072252">On the cross-examination of the officers who took the confession, he brought out the fact that Christopher Burger stated, in his confession, that Thomas Stevens told him to drive the car in the pond.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.017" offset="10114152">On cross-examination Botsford, who was present at all those acts preceding the murder, Mr. Leaphart brought out the fact that Botsford characterized this petitioner's involvement as following the directions of Thomas Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.245" offset="10175070">So it would be incorrect to characterize this case as one in which no mitigating evidence was presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.274" offset="10199103">What this Court is called upon to do, in this situation, is to examine the totality of the circumstances, all those facts as they existed and were known to counsel at the time of trial, to determine whether Mr. Leaphart's decision not to present that potentially damaging character evidence that was available to him at the time of trial was a reasonable decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.735" offset="10284993">Mr. Leaphart testified, unrefuted, and this petitioner was present at the Federal evidentiary hearing, did not take the witness stand and testify contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.714" offset="10320938">Mr. Leaphart testified that his client provided him the names of no individuals that he could talk to or use as potential witnesses; no one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.993" offset="10358032">Mr. Leaphart testified that notwithstanding that failing of his client, he spoke to the petitioner's mother and had consultations with her.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.333" offset="10387393">Now petitioner's mother testified that Leaphart never made any efforts to contact her, and that she only talk to him because she came--</text>

            <text syncTime="2584.308" offset="10487286">Mr. Leaphart testified that after Mr.... Dr. O'Hare examined the petitioner... now Dr. O'Hare had been used on numerous occasions by Mr. Leaphart in the past... Mr. Leaphart discussed in great detail the petitioner's testimony with Dr. O'Hare.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.349" offset="10543501">Now what is curious, too, is that in his consultations with Dr. O'Hare, this petitioner told Dr. O'Hare, and it was the basis for his evaluation and determinations of his IQ, that he had been struck in the head some five times between the ages of nine and 16, severe blows to the head, and this was the possible source of his brain damage; that his mother was dead, which was not true because his mother was at trial and testified at the evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.072" offset="10650394">Mr. Leaphart consulted with Dr. O'Hare, went over his evaluation and diagnosis, and decided that this testimony would not be favorable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.271" offset="10691145">But he used it on the Jackson Denno hearing in an effort to show that Christopher Burger lacked the requisite intellectual capacity to intelligently waive his Fifth Amendment rights under Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.736" offset="10733046">Now that testimony is available to this Court because it's in the Jackson Denno hearing of the trial transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.765" offset="10757078">After having actually heard his witness testify, after being subjected to cross-examination by the prosecution, Mr. Leaphart made a strategic trial decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.840" offset="10793441">And strategic decisions, once made after reasonable investigation of the law and facts, are virtually unchallengeable, to use this Court's language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.320" offset="10823325">He decided it would not be beneficial to his client to use that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.662" offset="10840670">In addition, Mr. Leaphart review with this psychologist psychologists' reports from Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.472" offset="10867942">He consulted with an attorney in Indiana who had served as a big brother.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.158" offset="10882675">Mr. Leaphart testified that after that telephone consultation that he and that attorney both agreed that that attorney could present no testimony favorable to Mr. Burger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.873" offset="10921545">Well, I understand that the psychologist couldn't have, or the attorney, but the argument your opponent makes, and I just want to be sure you respond to it properly, was that the way in which Mr. Leaphart questioned the mother and presumably also the psychologist did not let them know the kind of information that was readily available about his bouncing back and forth between his father and mother and all the difficulty he had as a young child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.035" offset="11018198">Now, certainly the sources of that information were available if he'd asked the right questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.675" offset="11040768">Your Honor, with all due respect, I think that opposing counsel's characterization of the record is not a fair characterization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.624" offset="11068562">Mr. Leaphart testified that he consulted with the mother and with Christopher Burger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.200" offset="11090819">He testified that he told Chris... in response to a question from counsel for the petitioner... that mitigating evidence was basically anything... you can put up anything in mitigation under Georgia statute; anything at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2762.674" offset="11200742">Now the distinction in the point that counsel for petitioner makes here today is that he contends that Mr. Leaphart did not make it clear to the mother what it was he needed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2806.686" offset="11376807">And Mr. Leaphart specifically testified that the only way he could get that information across to that jury was either to put the petitioner on the witness stand, which he did not because of the petitioner's sadistic attitude and his gloating attitude in describing the facts and the circumstances surround the kidnapping, the sexual assault and the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.210" offset="11446920">He was afraid he would alienate the jury, number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.490" offset="11456010">Number two, he couldn't control what his client would say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.786" offset="11469176">Because he had told him not to talk to authorities, but Christopher Burger continued to talk to anyone who would listen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.097" offset="11490492">And number three, he was afraid of what the district attorney would do with Christopher Burger on cross-examination in front of a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.938" offset="11517764">He testified that he did not use the mother, because the mother, subjected to cross-examination, would undercut his argument and his entire strategy to the jury, which is apparent from the first inception of cross-examination of the first witness through the conclusion of closing argument, which was that Christopher Burger was the less culpable of the two defendants, and because there are two punishments in Georgia for murder, life or death by electrocution, my client ought to get the least harsh punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.583" offset="11628419">If the mother had taken the witness stand, she would have testified to the troubled background, but also, the involvement with marijuana, the fact that he had been in trouble before in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.736" offset="11664990">Mr. Leaphart testified about prior assaultive encounters that Mr. Burger had had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.499" offset="11688082">And though the record is not extremely extensive on that point, it does show that Mr. Leaphart had reasonable strategic decisions for not using the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.199" offset="11726848">And the only two people available was the mother and Christopher Burger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.431" offset="11743775">Counsel now only belatedly some six years after trial has been able to find affidavits from seven people; only seven people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.070" offset="11778361">And while those seven individuals attest to the troubled background of Christopher Burger, they also carry with them in their affidavits, which I assume were drawn more favorably to this petitioner, extremely damaging testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.828" offset="11833323">The grandmother testified that Christopher Burger was a very bright child, which is contrary to the representation--</text>

            <text syncTime="2983.225" offset="12082949">But in using this belated affidavit testimony, in this analysis, the proper question is, whether if you inject this lukewarm but still extremely potentially damaging character evidence, does it render the sentence imposed... does it create a situation where it was reasonably likely that a different sentence would have been reached by this sentencer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3027.082" offset="12258388">Your Honor, what this Court must do is evaluate those circumstances as known to Mr. Leaphart at the time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.721" offset="12288899">At the time of trial, Mr. Leaphart only had this petitioner and his mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.062" offset="12306348">And the testimony I have detailed from the psychologist and the psychological evaluations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.982" offset="12325992">Mr. Leaphart travelled to Hindsville, where this petitioner was stationed at Ft Stewart, and he ascertained no favorable testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.917" offset="12353682">Which is not unreasonable when a soldier and a fellow soldier kidnap, armed rob, sexually sodomize and assault, and then murder another soldier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.446" offset="12387850">Mr. Leaphart testified that the only way to get any character evidence as far as background was through the petitioner or the petitioner's mother, but it carried with it substantial risks that outweighed the nature of that character testimony; which was not an unreasonable decision under the facts and circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.125" offset="12462561">The District Court so opined, and the Eleventh Circuit so found, and we ask that this Court concur in that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.887" offset="12485653">In my remaining time, I'd like to address the trial court's charge on intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.809" offset="12505297">What this petitioner advocates before this Court is that on reviewing a trial court's charge, a state trial court's charge for burden-shifting effect, mere identification anywhere in that trial court's charge of the Franklin language constitutes constitutional error without more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.223" offset="12574992">No consideration to the charge as a whole; no consideration as to how a reasonable juror, hearing this charge in this sequence, the words actually spoken, in the context of this case, would have understood this charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.279" offset="12627132">Now, this charge is different from and constitutionally distinguishable from the charge reviewed in Franklin, which, frankly, it is our contention, is a case that should be limited to its facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.729" offset="12668928">It is a fact-specific application of those principles enunciated in in re Winship, and talked about in Sandstrom v. Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.445" offset="12699857">This jury, in a case in which physical acts were not at issue... there was no contention here, because there was a confession... this jury was told that while an individual can be presumed to mean... to intend to do what he usually does, under our law, in order to have a crime, there must be a union of act and intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.686" offset="12780837">And in this case, criminal intent is an element that rests upon the state beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.434" offset="12803824">They were told that intent can never be presumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.448" offset="12815841">It is always a question of fact to be ascertained by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.916" offset="12833708">They were told that in resolving the issue of the existence or nonexistence of intent, you may look to the facts and circumstances of the case, including the conduct and actions of the defendant, and from those facts, proven beyond a reasonable doubt by the prosecution, you may infer intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.252" offset="12903090">But they were never told that you had to presume intent to kill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.609" offset="12920539">This jury, under the facts of this case, knew that in looking at the conduct of this defendant, Christopher Burger, who was the actual murderer, who shortly before the murder opened the trunk, asked the victim, hey man, you all right, closed the trunk, and immediately drove that car into that burrow pit filled with water after having first wiped his fingerprints to further secret his identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.585" offset="13020432">They were told that from those facts, you may infer that Christopher Burger had the subjective mens rea, the criminal intent to kill; but they were never told that you had to presume it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.736" offset="13060974">So this charge does not suffer from the defects found to exist in the case of Raymond Lee Franklin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.718" offset="13084902">Your Honor, the position of the respondent in this case is that this petitioner, who was afforded ample opportunity in the District Court to make out facts in support of his constitutional claims, never carried his burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.338" offset="13139446">Under prevailing constitutional principles, he is not entitled to Federal habeas corpus relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.820" offset="13161388">Those conclusions were reached by the District Court and affirmed by the Circuit Court.</text>
