            <text syncTime="15.463" offset="203321">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="26.146" offset="246058">This case presents the question, can a police officer who reasonably suspects that an object in plain view is stolen make a closer inspection of that item to dispel or confirm his suspicion?</text>
            <text syncTime="45.857" offset="324948">This question raises three issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.965" offset="341352">First of all, is a Fourth Amendment privacy interest implicated?</text>
            <text syncTime="54.932" offset="361206">Secondly, is a Fourth Amendment possessory interest implicated?</text>
            <text syncTime="59.914" offset="381163">And finally, if such a Fourth Amendment interest is implicated, either in the possessory aspect or in the privacy aspect, can an officer on reasonably, articulable suspicion, make a closer inspection of that particular item.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.109" offset="453992">The State submits that there is no possessory interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.311" offset="470711">There is no privacy interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.216" offset="478339">And furthermore, if this Court finds such an interest, it is so de minimus that an officer may on reasonable, articulable suspicion make a closer inspection of that item and confirm or dispel his suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.147" offset="542077">Here Officer Nelson, on April 18, 1984, entered an apartment, Mr. Hicks' apartment, to investigate a shooting.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.019" offset="577604">He entered the apartment to look for the assailant, his weapon, and perhaps other injured parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.625" offset="616056">They found guns, a mask, drug paraphernalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.513" offset="631521">And Officer Nelson noticed, as he entered the apartment, a stereo that appeared to him to be out of context with the mean surroundings of the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.853" offset="668928">It was on concrete block and board shelving.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.524" offset="683661">And it appeared to him to be too expensive for the types of items, the other items, that he saw in the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.193" offset="718247">This raised a suspicion in his mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.052" offset="729741">He suspected, having seen the other items that indicated the instrumentalities of crime, that indicated to him that a crime had been committed, that perhaps this stereo was stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.017" offset="765581">He took the serial number of the stereo down.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.876" offset="776970">He called it in to the identification bureau.</text>

            <text syncTime="170.247" offset="822528">It was not in plain view, so to speak, in plain sight.</text>

            <text syncTime="184.789" offset="880624">The government's position, however, is that that is such a de minimus... that inspection of a stereo unit already in plain view is so de minimus so as not to raise further privacy interests in the serial number in that the only information that can be conveyed from that serial number is whether or not the item is stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.621" offset="976024">And if it is stolen, then the legitimate privacy interest that would come into play there is not one that society is willing to recognize.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.102" offset="1013953">Officer Nelson called in the number.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.977" offset="1029418">It was reported to him to be stolen by a computer check.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.194" offset="1042270">He seized the stereo, the one that was reported to him to have been stolen, and took it with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.754" offset="1068497">He went back to the police station, pulled the robbery reports, ascertained that the other items that he had seen there in plain view, that he had noted the serial numbers on, were also stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.812" offset="1116771">An affidavit was sworn out and a search warrant was executed.</text>

            <text syncTime="287.186" offset="1290224">So if you can ascertain it by aided sight, as you have indicated here, I mean, I think you could also draw an analogy if an officer had glasses on; needed glasses to inspect the serial number.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.710" offset="1348321">Once he's legitimately where he has a right to be... and perhaps that is the threshold question that your question raises here, is that--</text>

            <text syncTime="313.534" offset="1395655">And if a telescope won't do it, it's some fancy electronic technique that has nothing to do with sight, but it reaches into my apartment and derives the serial number of my stereo.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.920" offset="1437241">And you say that's... that's okay, because that's not very important information.</text>

            <text syncTime="352.770" offset="1552598">And what I'm suggesting is, it doesn't matter whether it's important or not, does it, for purposes of whether there's been a search?</text>

            <text syncTime="1706.423" offset="6967259">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.449" offset="6991292">I think initially I want to say a couple of things that came up in the first part of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.931" offset="7017206">As Justice O'Connor pointed out, it has never been before argued, until the petition was granted here, that this was not a search nor a seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.801" offset="7064748">That never happened in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.629" offset="7072063">That was never argued in the Arizona Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.752" offset="7088572">So this is a new argument that the State has attacked the judgment of the trial court on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.263" offset="7126606">The other thing I'd like to bring to your attention is the question about serial numbers, and the State's position that all they want to be able to do is see serial numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.601" offset="7187942">I'm not sure serial numbers are strictly on items for the purpose of determining whether they're stolen or not stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.723" offset="7220438">Obviously, they have lot numbers and all sorts of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.941" offset="7233290">That may be true, but I'm not sure that that's the case always.</text>

            <label>Mr. John W. Rood, III</label>
            <text syncTime="1779.923" offset="7261189">Obviously, they think they're helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.389" offset="7271116">Our position is, quite frankly, that this is not a plain view case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.059" offset="7301731">That's been the position from the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.214" offset="7314375">Obviously the stereo units... and the Court must be aware, under the facts of this case, we're not just talking about one stereo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.413" offset="7351155">When the police came into the apartment, Officer Nelson noted a stereo on the living room wall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.973" offset="7377382">He apparently during his search for guns noticed another stereo in the living... excuse me, in the bedroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.313" offset="7410819">When he decided to copy down all these stereo numbers, not only the one Bang and Olufsen turntable was copied from, but apparently, although the record isn't clear what he had to do to get the other serial numbers, he copied down a whole series of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.275" offset="7490649">And while he was phoning in the serial numbers on the guns, he decided he might as well phone in these other serial numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.490" offset="7527429">The only thing that turned up on the computer was this one piece of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.003" offset="7545506">At a later point, it was determined the rest of the property was stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.688" offset="7564314">Again, our position is that this is not a plain view case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.952" offset="7589287">I note that Judge Myland, of the... of the Maryland Court of Special Appeals some ten years ago in a law review article in which they analyze the Coolidge v. New Hampshire decision, said that those who overapply the plain view doctrine to every situation where there is... where there is visual, open view have not learned the lesson long since mastered by old hands at the burlesque houses: you can't touch everything you see.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.909" offset="7713108">Wherever a policeman's eye may go, his body need not follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.219" offset="7734424">The thrust of the argument presented by the State of Arizona is aimed at the reasonableness of police conduct once they were legally inside Mr. Hicks' apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.868" offset="7788967">They argue the serial numbers were in plain view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.086" offset="7801819">They weren't in plain view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.586" offset="7807880">The police officer had to walk over and pick up the stereo unit, turn it over, look at it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2717.751" offset="11012477">Petitioner attempts to argue many ancillary issues, such as the facts... the fact this is not a search or a seizure, and that Mr. Hicks' had no privacy interest in the stereo, and therefore the Fourth Amendment does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.761" offset="11076530">In fact, the State's petition, as I said earlier, states that this was a seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.134" offset="11106100">To take the argument to its logical conclusion, police... when police are in someone's home legitimately, they can begin a general rummaging about the place to determine if there is stolen property, with no relationship to the fact that they're in there on a domestic violence call or an emergency call.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.499" offset="11195544">And all they have to say, at a later point in court, that they were suspicious of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.167" offset="11238175">The other argument is that this search is minimally intrusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.149" offset="11262104">I'd point out to the Court that, first of all, I believe there is a higher degree of protection in a person's home than necessarily elsewhere; that it certainly isn't minimally intrusive for individuals to handle personal effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.061" offset="11349770">And it would be our position that it's not reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.590" offset="11375893">What is, it seems to us, invidious here, is that the major basis for the search is the circumstances, and the circumstances presented at the suppression hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.677" offset="11452275">Except for the fact that this was a low-rent apartment, the officer wouldn't have had any reasonable suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.956" offset="11477352">To have this mere suspicion as a basis for search is contrary to the Fourth Amendment and beyond any cases that have been decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.060" offset="11521761">The State, in actual fact, in the court below, in the trial court, never argued anything other than the fact that they believed that the Leon case should apply to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.163" offset="11594172">In other words, in the trial court, that was their large argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.522" offset="11607651">When they appealed the case, that was their argument, that no matter what, that this officer had relied on a good faith belief that these items were stolen, and therefore, the items should not be suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.763" offset="11680585">In fact, I believe that Judge Livermore, in his decision in the case, took care of that by saying... well, first of all, that this wasn't a warrant case; the other thing being, you can't present the fruits of an illegal search, or as he put it, the police cannot launder the fruits of their illegal search by having a magistrate put some sort of stamp of approval on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.689" offset="11808272">Based on all that, we would ask that this Court affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and the trial court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2942.541" offset="11911717">First of all, there were guns that they found.</text>

            <text syncTime="2955.739" offset="11964484">The experience of the officer: He had 12 years of experience, and he knew that stereos were frequently the subject of property crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.971" offset="11993428">He had heard the name of one of the occupants of the apartment as being an individual who was involved in a criminal investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.201" offset="12026342">There was a shooting, and indeed, an injury, just shortly before the officer came into this apartment; that is, more criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.871" offset="12056957">And there was drug paraphernalia all around the apartment.</text>
