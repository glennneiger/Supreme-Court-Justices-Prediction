            <text syncTime="24.198" offset="249518">The issue presented in this case is whether a lender is entitled to notice pursuant to Section 6303(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of an assessment which has been made against an employer for unpaid income withholding taxes in Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or FICA, taxes in order for the Government to obtain judgment against a third party lender for these taxes on a derivative basis under Section 3505 of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.455" offset="398520">As noted by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in the recent case of Messina Builders, this issue has left the Court of Appeals in disarray.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.846" offset="436136">To date, the Seventh, Eighth, and Eleventh Circuits Court of Appeals have decided that notice must be provided to a lender, and the Third and Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals have decided that no such notice is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.856" offset="496113">Very briefly, the facts of this case show that beginning in 1976 Jersey Shore entered into a commercial lending relationship with a corporation known as Pennmount Industries, Incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.449" offset="554523">Subsequent to entering into that commercial relationship, in which Jersey Shore advanced funds which were secured by mortgages and accounts receivable, Pennmount Industries became delinquent from the fourth quarter of 1977 through the first quarter of 1980 with regard to paying to the Government its employee withholding taxes which it had withheld.</text>

            <text syncTime="135.653" offset="695271">For the period of time from January of 1979 through March of 1980, we would concede that the bank would otherwise be liable for the taxes except for the issue of notice, which of course applies across the board to the entire liability in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.595" offset="759114">And of course, if that were the only section... portion of taxes that the Government were seeking to collect, we really wouldn't be here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.499" offset="786700">But the issue which is before the Court applies across the board.</text>

            <text syncTime="164.370" offset="810210">On December the 30th, 1983, approximately six years after the first tax liability of Pennmount arose, the Government filed suit against Jersey Shore to collect the--</text>

            <text syncTime="279.200" offset="1269547">It should be noted that furnishing of notice to a lender is not simply a formalistic requirement which is devoid of substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.456" offset="1306536">Once an assessment has been made against an employer within the three year period of time for bringing assessments under Section 6501, then the statute of limitations is correspondingly extended for an additional six year period of time under Section 6502.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.287" offset="1385844">Not only is the statute extended against the employer, but it is also extended against the lender as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.979" offset="1444672">Having the benefit of this extended period of time, up to nine years, there is an inherent prejudice which results in the failure of the Government to provide notice to the lender.</text>

            <text syncTime="806.580" offset="3378987">The Third Circuit, however, in its majority opinion seemed to justify this differing treatment that's being afforded to a lender as opposed to an employer on the basis of the notice requirement contained in Section 3505 itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.041" offset="3452861">In other words, the Third Circuit said that a lender cannot be held liable unless the Government can prove actual notice or knowledge that the employer had not paid its employee withholding taxes or that the funds were supplied by the lender to the employer with knowledge that the employer would not pay those taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.121" offset="3541155">However, this distinction, as noted by the Messina Builders case in the Eighth Circuit, is inapplicable because of the fact that actual notice or knowledge under Section 3505 is a defined term which includes within it the definition contained in Section 6323 of the Code, which can indeed mean lack of due diligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.170" offset="3637390">Therefore, a lender can be held liable under Section 3505(b) not only on the basis of actual notice or knowledge, but on the basis that the lender failed to exercise due diligence with regard to ascertaining the fact that the employee taxes had not been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.817" offset="3719937">With regard to the legislative history of Section 3505, there is nothing to show in that history or the Congressional reports that Congress in creating a new class of persons who were liable for this tax on a derivative basis, that is to say lenders, intended to exempt the Government from providing the notice required under Section 6303(a) to persons liable for the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.621" offset="3843235">It must be presumed, we would urge, that Congress does not legislate in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.959" offset="3868522">If Congress had intended to place an exemption for Section 6303 notice and had intended to afford the Government the right to that exemption, then it would have changed the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.035" offset="3924842">It did not do so and the statute remains under Section 6303(a) that each person liable for the tax is entitled to notice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1759.771" offset="7191820">Let me make a couple of preliminary observations about things that have already gone on in the argument before I get to my main presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.810" offset="7227973">First, as a factual matter, the district court's opinion at page 29A of the appendix reflects that the Petitioner did concede liability in this case in the district court for a portion of the liability that the Government sought to collect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.403" offset="7290353">And it also reflects that that was liability under Section 3505(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.790" offset="7311878">That is, they concede that they were actually paying the taxes directly, and under 3505(a) there is not even a scienter requirement at all, since Congress understood that if they were paying the taxes directly... excuse me... if they were paying the wages directly, they would certainly know that withholding taxes were not being paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.002" offset="7376767">So that I think is undisputed, and I think there was just a little confusion earlier.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1811.137" stopTime="1887.101">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1811.137" offset="7397247">I'd also like to talk about exactly what the issue is here, because I think that's gotten a little bit confused before also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.142" offset="7429325">Petitioner does seem to be at least partly making the argument that the statute of limitations bars the suit here because we brought suit more than three years after the tax return was filed and that the suit is therefore timely only under Section 6502.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.223" offset="7509573">That argument, that notice of assessment is required to extend the statute of limitations, in fact was not raised below and is now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.079" offset="7544995">I think the argument is erroneous even if it were to be raised, and I hope to address that later if I have time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.983" offset="7568610">But I think that the question that is before the Court is whether... is kind of a question of remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.470" offset="7598598">Their claim is that there is this requirement that a notice of assessment be sent both to the employer and to the bank, and that the failure to send such a notice somehow completely eliminates any possibility of collecting 3505 liability, whether or not it's within the three year period, whether or not it's within the six year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.383" offset="7686265">If it did it for them, I presume it would do it for the employer as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="1897.991" offset="7744675">But the Jenkins case, the Erie Forge case that are cited in our brief, are cases like that where notice of assessment through oversight was not sent, and we brought suit against the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.415" offset="7790337">And the Court said the notice of assessment is relevant to the assessment process, to the administrative collection process, but it has nothing to do with the Government's right to collect by suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.556" offset="7830984">Their position is just, they're just saying that failure to send this notice somehow completely prevents the Government from doing other things that are unrelated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1972.755" offset="8043725">But I would say that I think, at least is this situation, even if there were, the correct remedy would not be to completely bar a 3505 suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.111" offset="8081132">I think the cases you're speaking about, Mr. Chief Justice, are cases where the surety would be able to show that it was somehow prejudiced by the failure to receive notice, and that there was a reason why it shouldn't be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.502" offset="8126690">This case is really just a case of statutory interpretation, where this Court must divine Congressional intent, the intent reflected in Section 6303(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.011" offset="8180711">In our view, this is not a difficult case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.378" offset="8190220">Petitioner's contention rests on an effort to create a relationship between two provisions of the Code that are simply not closely related.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.867" offset="8224179">It wrenches the language of 6303 from its context and gives it a meaning that is plainly not intended by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.140" offset="8253227">Moreover, the practical effect of their argument is to completely destroy the efficacy of Section 3505.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.877" offset="8280185">Now, we think our position is clearly correct, but I guess the only way to explain the fact that we've lost several times in the lower courts is that I think the Code provisions here are somewhat confusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.951" offset="8332535">And so, if the Court will bear with me, I'd like to have a fairly detailed discussion of the statutory background before I really get into the merits of Petitioner's contentions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2066.983" offset="8420620">The Internal Revenue Code sets up two distinct methods of collecting liabilities against the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.621" offset="8443189">There is an administrative collection system and a judicial collection system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.338" offset="8458027">The judicial collection system I don't need to dwell on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.440" offset="8470461">The Government files a suit in court and if it wins the suit it has a judgment in its favor and it could collect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.678" offset="8495434">Now, the administrative system is triggered by what is called a Government assessment of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.915" offset="8520407">The assessment is a term of art, and that's what is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.050" offset="8536917">When an assessment is made, triggering this administrative system, the Government does not need to go to court in order to satisfy its liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.175" offset="8573384">It can resort to summary collection procedures, which involve levying on the property of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.810" offset="8595953">The issuance of an assessment followed by a demand also establishes a lien on the taxpayer's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.832" offset="8628032">And the only way the taxpayer can deal with an assessment, really, is by paying the tax and then filing the refund suit, in which case the burden is then on the taxpayer to prove an entitlement to a refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.521" offset="8670768">Because of this, there is a preference for the Commissioner to assess in many cases, because it's more convenient for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.294" offset="8705877">On the other hand, all liabilities are not assessable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.328" offset="8721968">There are classes of liabilities where an assessment cannot be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.815" offset="8739940">Most taxes are assessable, but the Code also requires that certain taxes... that there must be a notice of deficiency issued before the taxes can be assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.307" offset="8789887">For example, if one files on income tax return and the Commissioner determines that there is a deficiency in that return, that the amount reported as due on the return is less than what is actually owed, and the Commissioner issues a notice of deficiency, the taxpayer has the opportunity to contest that notice in the Tax Court before an assessment can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.637" offset="8875255">Now, for the purposes here we must remember that employment taxes are assessable against the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.226" offset="8901586">On the other hand, Section 3505 liability for third party lenders is not assessable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.130" offset="8925201">The only way the Government can collect that liability is by bringing a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.998" offset="8940665">Now, Section 6303, the provision at issue here, is part of this assessment process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.038" offset="8972848">It's on page 51A, and it is triggered by the making of an assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.240" offset="8993642">It provides that when an assessment is made, the Secretary shall within 60 days after making the assessment of the tax give notice to each person liable for the unpaid tax, stating the amount and demanding payment thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.082" offset="9049021">Now, a little bit later I hope to talk about, parse the statute carefully, and discuss Petitioner's plain meaning argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.271" offset="9085802">But for now I would just like to explain how this fits into the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.909" offset="9100326">When an assessment is made, the Government gives this notice of assessment to the taxpayer, who then is on notice as to what he owes and what amount has been assessed against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.348" offset="9146092">And there is also a demand for payment of that amount by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.752" offset="9159676">If the taxpayer refuses to make that payment, at that point the lien provisions kick in and the Government is entitled to levy on his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.607" offset="9195098">The purpose... I think clearly the purpose of this section... and I'm not sure the Petitioner would dispute that this is the primary purpose, although he tries to read some other purposes into it as well... the purpose is to give the taxpayer the opportunity to take steps to avoid the summary collection procedures, so that he is put on notice that these things are about to commence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.688" offset="9279421">Section 3505 is a completely different animal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.390" offset="9298229">It creates a liability for third party lenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.942" offset="9312440">It was passed by Congress in 1966 to address a specific problem that they had discovered, the practice of net payroll financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.714" offset="9347549">The way the system works... and it's described in some detail in the Court of Appeals opinion at page 4A and 5A.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.219" offset="9377537">It was pretty prevalent in the construction industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.671" offset="9391434">When a particular subcontractor started running into financial difficulties, it would receive funds, either from a prime contractor or from a lender, to help it keep its business going.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.395" offset="9442321">But in order to limit their liability, the lenders would advance funds only to the extent of the net payroll, the money that the employer would actually have to pay to the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.119" offset="9485162">The money that the employers were withholding, at least on paper, would not be advanced by the lender and would never appear... would never be paid to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.908" offset="9520375">Now, this is the Government's money and the Government is out the money at some point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.010" offset="9540750">For example, if one of the employees has a significant amount listed as withholding tax that's withheld from his paycheck, but then it ultimately turns out he doesn't owe any tax, the Government... he'll file his tax return and the Government will have to pay a refund of several thousand dollars to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.508" offset="9618700">It's refunding money that the Government never got, because no one ever paid it in as withholding tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.994" offset="9640642">So Congress viewed this as a serious problem, and the way it sought to... well, the reason... I'm sorry, let me backtrack for a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.314" offset="9673975">The reason Congress could not collect this money from the lenders before was because the Code only defined, only gave the Government a right to collect it from employers, and these lenders were not employers within the meaning of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.240" offset="9725697">So they passed Section 3505 to give the Government a direct remedy against these lenders, and the statute, which is set out at page 50A, has two sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.548" offset="9770941">It applies to third party lenders who are directly paying the net payroll.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.933" offset="9792466">They are made subject to liability in the amount of the withholding taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.571" offset="9810961">And Section 3505(b) also extends this liability, I think to prevent lenders from just circumventing this by going through a conduit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.510" offset="9850771">It also applies to lenders who are making loans for the purpose of paying a payroll.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.431" offset="9874386">Now, the notion here was that these lenders were sitting in the same position as the employers, and the Government thought it was... excuse me... Congress thought that it was reasonable to treat them the same as employers for these purposes and to make them assume liability for these taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.625" offset="9943245">The overriding purpose of this statute was to make sure that the Government got its withholding tax, preferably at the outset, but if not through a later suit under Section 3505.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.183" offset="9985459">Now, Petitioner's contention here is that it can escape this liability that Congress deliberately put upon it, simply by the essentially unrelated fact that an assessment has been made against the employer and that it did not receive a notice of that assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.792" offset="10051914">This is really an absurd contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.263" offset="10065811">Clearly, clearly there is no entitlement to notice at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.631" offset="10083261">If the Government brought suit within three years, without making a notice of assessment, it could sue the employer, it could sue the lender, without issuing any notice at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.106" offset="10125162">So the purported notice requirement only arises somehow from the making of an assessment against an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.110" offset="10153165">But that is not an event that has any particular bearing on the lender.</text>

            <text syncTime="2556.293" offset="10377922">That's one of the reasons why the lender is in fact not covered by Section 6303(a), because that refers only to persons who are liable for the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.968" offset="10416584">A lender is not subject to the tax; he is subject to liability, to a separate liability created by Section 3505.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.889" offset="10444273">In fact, as I mentioned earlier, Section 3505 liability is not assessable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.109" offset="10465171">It probably would be assessable if Congress had established it as a tax, because all taxes are assessable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.679" offset="10491398">So this, the fact that Congress set it up this way, redounds to the benefit of the lenders because it immunizes them from these administrative collection procedures and requires the Government to resort to judicial action in order to collect this liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="2656.172" offset="10777387">Well, deducted and withheld from such wages by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.759" offset="10807793">Well, at any rate, I think it's clear that the statute, what it does make the lender liable for is withholding taxes, not the employer's portion of social security, but withholding taxes, which means income tax that are withheld and the employee's portion of social security; and that it does not require payment of taxes over and above what has already been paid 100 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.977" offset="10912597">I'm told that the legislative history makes it clear that there is a credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.833" offset="10940078">Well, I think there are... let me say two things briefly about Petitioner's contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.473" offset="10990651">One, this notice that they're asking for tells them nothing that they don't already know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.627" offset="11011235">It doesn't serve any purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.944" offset="11016460">The only purpose I think that Petitioner adverted to in his argument is this notion of extending the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.614" offset="11043209">Putting that aside for a moment, certainly getting notice that the taxes have been assessed against the employer doesn't tell the lender anything, because there is this scienter requirement in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.926" offset="11104440">They can only be held liable under Section 3505 if they have actual notice that withholding taxes have not been paid by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.448" offset="11142474">And the amount, as has been discussed before, the amount that is on the notice of assessment to the employer, doesn't mean anything to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.454" offset="11182494">It doesn't tell it what its liability might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.756" offset="11191689">Nor does sending it at copy suggest that the Government is planning to sue the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.525" offset="11206840">It would just be sending it a copy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.410" offset="11214363">And the other serious problem here is that the interpretation sought by Petitioner would completely eliminate 3505(a) from the Code, because there's just no way that the IRS can know at the time it makes these assessments, which is usually within a couple of months of the time the withholding tax return is filed, whether there is a lender, whether the lender might arguably be subject to 3505(a) liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.210" offset="11321570">So I do think that Petitioner's contention here makes absolutely no sense within the structure of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.964" offset="11348528">Now, given that, the only argument that he has really is the plain meaning of the statute, and that is the argument that the other Court of Appeals have gone off on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.420" offset="11394399">I think even Judge Weis dissenting here and some of the other courts have recognized that the Government's position makes more sense, but they have found themselves to be bound by the plain meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.776" offset="11431807">So I would like to talk a little bit about the plain meaning of the statute, because I think even looking at 6303(a) alone, without considering its impact on the rest of the Code, the plain meaning in fact does support the Government's reading of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.868" offset="11492202">First of all, I won't dwell on this because it came up quite a bit earlier, but Section 6303(a) clearly contemplates the sending of a particular kind of notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.407" offset="11534311">It says:</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.507" offset="11538700">"After making of an assessment of tax, shall give notice to each person liable for the unpaid tax, stating the amount and demanding payment thereof. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.827" offset="11572032">Now, the notice that Petitioner seeks just doesn't do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2993.145" offset="12125305">And what I'm trying to say is that sending this notice to the employer does demand payment of that money from the employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3012.206" offset="12201583">And the only way he can contest that liability in court is by paying the money and then filing the refund suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.610" offset="12227183">The bank is in a very different position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.212" offset="12237527">Sending a copy of this to the bank, even assuming it had the right amount that the bank might potentially be liable for, is not a demand for payment from the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.652" offset="12275353">We have no right to demand payment from the bank until we have sued them and established their liability in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.489" offset="12298654">So I do think that sending the notice to the bank is not at all the notice that is contemplated by Section 6303(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.046" offset="12336897">And I would say that even... Petitioner tries to litigate this case by focusing on the one phrase in the statute,</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.985" offset="12372633">"a person liable for the unpaid tax. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.318" offset="12381932">and not looking at the rest of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.520" offset="12390814">Even looking at that particular phrase, the plain meaning does not support its position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.424" offset="12410353">First of all, "the unpaid tax" seems to me pretty clearly to refer to same tax that is referred to in the previous sentence, which is the tax that has been assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.380" offset="12454239">And that is not the tax that the bank is liable for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.316" offset="12465942">Another point is that, as I mentioned before in talking with Justice Blackmun, it's not a tax at all that is imposed on the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.521" offset="12498752">It is just a liability, specially created by Section 3505, and that is not a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.193" offset="12529472">It is certainly not the tax that is listed in the notice of assessment because, as we've mentioned before, the amounts are not going to be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.763" offset="12559774">So I don't think there's any reason why courts have to feel compelled by the plain meaning of the statute to reach a result that is really quite absurd in the context of the rest of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.707" offset="12615571">If anything, the statute, if read in a sensible way, I think reflects its intended purpose, which is that when a liability, tax liability, is assessed against an employer or any other taxpayer, he has to be told what that assessment is so that he can take whatever steps are necessary to avoid having his property levied upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.607" offset="12727167">Now, I would like to talk about the statute of limitations a little bit because I think that's the only thing that Petitioner has come up with where the notice could conceivably make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.415" offset="12766350">First, there's the general claim that there's an element of unfairness here because he's not receiving... the bank is not receiving notice of this extended... I'm sorry.</text>

            <text syncTime="3209.032" offset="12988809">Now, there is this statute of limitations issue, where Section 6502, which is the six year statute of limitations, kicks in upon the making of an assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.274" offset="13033844">I really think the statute of limitations issue is a red herring, though.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.744" offset="13051712">There really is no unfairness in this present system, and there's no reason for the bank to complain about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.232" offset="13077625">First of all, it's a little misleading to talk about this as an extension of the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.486" offset="13102703">The Code sets up two different statutes of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.421" offset="13114406">There is a three year statute of limitations on assessments, and along with that there is the same statute of limitations on suits that are brought without assessments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.645" offset="13155261">Basically, what that section does is that it tells the President that it has to get its act together within three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.882" offset="13180234">It has to decide what the taxpayer's liability is for its own purposes, and either make an assessment or bring a suit to get it going.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.738" offset="13215656">Then there is a second provision, Section 6502, which says that once an assessment is made, once the Government has made this determination, it then has six years to collect the liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.944" offset="13260482">Now, that's the way the system works.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.296" offset="13269887">That's the standard statute of limitations is six years after assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.366" offset="13286187">The normal course of business... and the bank I don't think can deny this... in almost every case, since assessments are routinely sent out when withholding tax is not paid, there is going to be an assessment made and there is then going to be a six year statute of limitations on the collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.142" offset="13353269">That will apply to the employer, that will apply to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.161" offset="13365390">And there is no reason for the bank to think that the statute is going to be anything less.</text>

            <text syncTime="3441.431" offset="13918455">If the bank is as ignorant of what's going on with the employer as it's trying to make itself out to be, it wouldn't even know that the employer had filed a withholding tax return.</text>

            <text syncTime="3608.165" offset="14585413">Well, of course the first response to that is, well, what does the notice tell the employer?</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.403" offset="14606311">Certainly the employer already knows that he's liable for the tax because he's filed the return and indicates that he owes the money.</text>
