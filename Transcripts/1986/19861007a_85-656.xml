            <text syncTime="63.990" offset="404708">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the State of Washington has a uniquely open election system, a system unusually hospitable to new and minor parties and independents and their candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.333" offset="466043">Washington voters wishing to exercise their right to politically associate through these vehicles easily organize and choose their candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.772" offset="499898">Those candidates have long been automatically placed on the Washington elections ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.026" offset="520900">After a 1976 election, with the most crowded ballot in Washington's history, the Washington legislature decided to exercise what this Court has called a state's undoubted right to require candidates to make a showing of substantial support in order to qualify for a place on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.256" offset="597805">The Washington legislature, by statute, placed all candidates on the primary ballot and added a requirement that any candidate not able to attract the votes of 1 percent of the voters would not remain on the ballot a second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.849" offset="660185">It is that 1 percent requirement to remain on the ballot a second time that is challenged here by a candidate placed on the Washington primary ballot who got fewer than 600 votes, less than one-tenth of the 1 percent, and thus was not remained on the... did not remain on the Washington ballot a second time in the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.429" offset="746494">I shall explain first the Washington experience and the election with its crowded ballot in 1976 leading to this change, then telling you why the 1 percent is consistent with this Court's numerical definitions of substantial support and argue under this Court's decision the Washington requirement is neither unconstitutional per se and is less than the numerical test that this Court has approved, such as the Jenness v. Fortson, a 5 percent of voters test, arguing that it is less burdensome on minor parties and serves to improve the political debate which is the constitutional issue before the Court; finally... and also that the Washington statute by cutting off some few candidates avoids subsidizing hopeless candidates, as this Court recognized in the different case of Buckley v. Valeo was appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.814" offset="959966">Finally, I can show--</text>

            <text syncTime="211.937" offset="996538">The printing on the ballot and the counting of votes is one issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.455" offset="1006569">Washington is also unique in the states that we print and distribute to every residence in Washington a voter's pamphlet and candidates' pamphlet for publicizing the election and the candidates, at considerable expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.262" offset="1049828">In that additional regard, I think, we are subsidizing hopeless candidates by placing on the ballot those candidates that have not and will not receive any substantial support.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="235.052" offset="1089011">Is that kind of information disseminated in connection with the primary as well as the general election?</text>

            <label>Mr. James M. Johnson</label>
            <text syncTime="238.904" offset="1104371">It is not, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.106" offset="1109178">It is only disseminated in conjunction with the general, and may have been one factor in the legislature determination to move this substantial support determination to the primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.395" offset="1150347">I referred to Washington's uniquely open system.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.497" offset="1162781">I shortly explain, and explain the relevance of this system.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.019" offset="1188799">In Washington there is no party registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.136" offset="1197263">There is no identification of voters by party in the State of Washington at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.322" offset="1210010">The voting is a blanket primary, we have referred to it, and the general is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.308" offset="1229968">Under a blanket voting system each Washington voter may vote for any candidate for any position irregardless of party affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.897" offset="1264345">One vote per race, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.230" offset="1273645">In a case tomorrow arising from Connecticut you will hear debated the merits of open versus closed primaries and restrictions on voters, how they vote by party.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.555" offset="1315023">In Washington we have no such system.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.155" offset="1321396">The Washington system is more open than the open primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.209" offset="1341563">This has direct relevance, of course, to using a primary vote requirement for determining substantial support, since any Washington voter attracted to the votes can vote for any and all candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.999" offset="1384717">For example, a Washington voter may choose to vote for a Socialist Worker candidate for governor, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, a Democrat candidate for their local legislatures, et cetera, down the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.474" offset="1434663">Thus again the primary test is much easier than it would be in most states with either a closed or open primary in which party affiliation is somehow tested first before the voters can exercise their option.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.984" offset="1500701">Finally, in Washington if any candidate is not on the ballot a Washington voter can write in any candidate with the sole exception of a sore loser of a major party primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.791" offset="1547930">The Court of Appeals decision in this regard is just confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.743" offset="1559738">The District Court finding of fact and conclusion of law at JSC 5 is accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.028" offset="1580845">The Washington statute allows write-ins with the sole exception I have mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.730" offset="1595682">If not on the ballot, of course, in the Washington system the voters have made that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.550" offset="1622954">In 1976 the voters had lots of options to choose from, culminating the preceding four elections' increase in the number of independent and minor candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.442" offset="1666526">The 1976 election had 12 parties, one of which, the OWL, Out with Logic, On with Lunacy, Party, was avowedly frivolous and ran a statewide slate.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.999" offset="1716786">There were numerous candidates, however, as noted in our brief, 65 of them on that ballot.</text>

            <text syncTime="450.935" offset="1952515">Of those six independent and minor party candidates, none of them got 1 percent in the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.441" offset="1978533">Four of them, including the Socialist Workers Party candidate, got less than.3 percent of the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.810" offset="1999953">This, by the way, was also consistent with the preceding history in Washington of minor parties and independents.</text>

            <text syncTime="477.085" offset="2057109">The Washington legislature reasonably then saw this unduly lengthy ballot, and as we have discussed, Mr. Chief Justice, with regards to the voters' pamphlet, I think reasonably concluded that in some regard the ballot placement and the voters' pamphlet were subsidizing hopeless candidates, and the "subsidizing hopeless candidates" is your language--</text>

            <text syncTime="1457.941" offset="5980492">Ultimately, then, to the extent that a few of these candidates do not remain on the ballot, and as we note in our reply brief, the summary numbers are that of 48 candidates, independent and minor party, since the '76 election, since the '76 changes, I believe the number was 37 of them have remained on the general election ballot, and again, they are already on the ballot in the primary and thus afforded the opportunity to participate in political debate through that part, and most of them, albeit usually for the U.S. Representative and local races, including Washington State legislative, most of those candidates have remained on the ballot.</text>

            <text syncTime="1568.013" offset="6420812">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, when we analyzed state restrictions on political expression and association relating to minor parties with dissident views, we are operating in the core of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.339" offset="6486118">Since there is no litmus test for ballot access restrictions, the numbers game is not useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.628" offset="6519241">The cases do not say 1 percent is constitutional or an early deadline is unconstitutional, so to decide this case it is necessary to look at three questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.538" offset="6574934">First, did the 1977 additional restrictions have a substantial impact on expression and association of minor parties and voters?</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.262" offset="6625821">Two, is there a governmental interest in these additional restrictions so compelling that it outweighs the burden on fundamental First Amendment rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.855" offset="6676185">And three, are the new restrictions precisely drawn so that First Amendment rights are not necessarily... unnecessarily burdened, or could the legitimate state interest be achieved by less drastic means?</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.948" offset="6736580">I would like to address these in order, but first I must touch on the most crucial aspect of Washington's ballot access amendments of 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.054" offset="6777018">This was the conversion of the traditional one-step barrier as it applies in every other state in which qualifying candidates participate in the general election whether they are a minor party or major party nominees to a two-step exclusionary process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.484" offset="6858729">Now, as to the first step, as Mr. Johnson has discussed, Washington's nomination process, by convention, is different from a door-to-door petition signature requirement, so it is not automatic qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.696" offset="6927588">Far from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.413" offset="6930409">The mounting of convention does require substantial effort, and in 1977 the legislature doubled the number of participants required with the result that the nominees that have been able to... the minor parties that have been able to qualify as shown by the table on Page 5 and 6 of our brief has been extremely limited--</text>

            <text syncTime="1766.542" offset="7214934">And that restriction had been somewhat, I guess, degenerating by the increase of population, and the legislature remedied that problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1781.050" offset="7272926">In 1977 the legislature about doubled it, and now it is tied to population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.085" offset="7293093">Since that change, the number of nominees has been one, two, or in one case three, and so we are talking about a very small and identifiable group of dissident parties who like the Socialist Workers Party and the Libertarian Party who filed the amicus brief here, who consistently over the years have put forth substantial effort into the electoral system to introduce their new ideas to the voters and have continued to be able to qualify candidates in very small numbers by convention.</text>

            <text syncTime="1936.061" offset="7892969">With that exception, when there was no contest, every time there has been a contest for the Republican or Democratic nomination, no minor party candidate has ever been able to qualify for statewide office.</text>

            <text syncTime="2298.715" offset="9343601">Well, it depends on what the requirement is, because the numerical requirements for petition signatures, which are the only requirements that have been upheld by this Court, do represent some level of organizational ability and diligence that the party itself can control and go out and get signatures on the petitions, in Jenness, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.497" offset="9442761">We are not saying we will vote for this candidate, but we think that this candidate should be allowed on the ballot, and because of the traditional American openness to hearing different points of view, it is very easy to get people to go out and say, yes, we believe you should be allowed to be heard, and in American Party versus Texas, the Socialist Workers Party went out and got 22,000 plus signatures on their petition to get on the ballot without a serious problem but by their diligence and by their effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.017" offset="9560835">And the vote, on the other hand, as the record indicates, reflects the primary contest by the major parties and not the diligence or the efforts put out by the minor party within their limited capabilities, but that is more related to the contribution a party can make to the debate that they are capable of organizing and organizational effort like that to gather petition signatures than to make it rely on having some certain level of support in the primary election for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.838" offset="9696149">Number One is that the primary is not an adequate forum as a substitute for the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.344" offset="9730108">First of all, the timing is prior to the identification of the candidates by the nominating process of the major parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.700" offset="9763545">Second, as in this race, there are numerous, often dozens of major party candidates that still have to be selected by the party for who is going to represent them, and so that if there is any confusion, which Mr. Johnson identified as the interest the state is concerned about, it takes place at the primary, as in this case with 32 Democrats and Republicans on the ballot along with a single Socialist Workers Party candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.081" offset="9865109">The voting machine has no instruction on that of what even the purpose of the minor party candidate is on the ballot, and if the minor parties are going to make a contribution to the election process, it is not because they are likely to win, but because in the debate between the representatives of the parties they have some new ideas and they have a differing point of view.</text>

            <text syncTime="3444.183" offset="13925478">In fact, the convention requirement in Washington is the equivalent of a petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.504" offset="13946794">First, the convention requirement was not challenged below at all, as you can see from the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.722" offset="13967692">Secondly, the District Court found that this party's convention was a "street corner convention".</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.709" offset="13991620">The attachments to C13, an affidavit of the party, show the candidates standing on a street corner in Seattle conducting their convention, and the point is, that is all right with Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.167" offset="14037387">We do not have any separate barrier through convention at the de minimis 200 voter requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.123" offset="14065285">Finally, I think we should consider the alternatives that are clearly and constitutionally available to Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.027" offset="14088900">The Jenness versus 5 percent requirement would work an obligation to get 122,000 signatures to qualify for the Washington ballot as contrasted with the 9,000 for a Governor' race in Washington and a sliding scale actually which we impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.786" offset="14155878">The 1 percent is applied to each office, working your way down the ballot, and is much less, of course, for local offices, and this is why Washington legislative positions and local offices, the minor parties have always been successful in qualifying for the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.879" offset="14212303">One percent is not a large requirement to dictate substantial support.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.450" offset="14230588">Any other kind of method, Mr. Smith suggests we use a scalpel, but any content control requirement to discern frivolous parties would, I submit, be unconstitutional, so a numerical requirement is required constitutionally, The 1 percent imposed by the Washington statute is reasonable and easily reached by a diligent party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.065" offset="14325047">Therefore we conclude the Washington statute is constitutional and ought to be upheld.</text>
