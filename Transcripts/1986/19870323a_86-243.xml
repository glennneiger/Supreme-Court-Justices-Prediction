            <text syncTime="2033.301" offset="8280775">It seems to me that the Court would do well as it twice has in Justice Blackmun's opinion in Munson and in Justice White's opinion in Ferber to read Professor Monahan's article in the 1981 Supreme Court Review, I think it offers analytically sound approach to all of this that gets you out of a lot of the verbal traps of the sort that you have just instanced.</text>

            <text syncTime="2083.151" offset="8480142">But here, I submit, there really is very little, if anything, that is a valid application of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.208" offset="8528416">And I was especially pleased to hear my friend, Mr. Collins, refer the Court to page 77 of the Joint Appendix, Officer Kelley's testimony that it's only in the course of an investigation you do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.218" offset="8592468">Because I was re-reading the Joint Appendix this week-end and something struck me that somehow I'd missed the significance of it in all my other preparation of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.526" offset="8633637">On that very page, Officer Kelley says that in the course of my investigations I have been interrupted thousands of times without making an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.049" offset="8679717">And the court intervenes; Judge DeAnda says: how often have you made an arrest for violation of this ordinance?</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.587" offset="8705944">And Officer Kelley says: twice, this case and one other that's referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.058" offset="8731753">It seems to me the danger in an ordinance where an officer feels that I've been interrupted thousands of times and he only makes an arrest twice suggests that the real flaw in this ordinance is that it does give such wide discretion to the arresting officer to decide what is an interruption and what is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.957" offset="8827361">But, even if the person he arrests is acquitted, as Raymond Hill was, to be arrested and to spend 18 hours in jail is not insignificant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.747" offset="8874591">The probability, I hardly need remind this court is that sweeping statutes of this kind are not likely to be used against people who wear three-pieced suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.203" offset="8920357">They are likely to be used against those who are not at the top of the ladder socially.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.357" offset="8940942">I well remember in 1967, the night before the Texas/Oklahoma game, I was in Dallas and observing what I observed, what I thought to be improper police force in arresting a young man for allegedly jaywalking, my friend and I went to every police officer in sight and said: Officer, I want to get your name and badge number for the 1983 action I am bringing Monday morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.824" offset="9042819">And the officers were all very cooperative and indeed we didn't have a pen so we'd have to say, would you please lend us your pen and they would.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.311" offset="9068837">Now I am glad that the game was played in Dallas and not in Houston because I take it that I would have violated the ordinance, although it seems to me highly unlikely that I would have been prosecuted for violating it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.786" offset="9118679">I'd like to change slightly, it I may, an example that was discussed during Mr. Collins' argument and put it in the terms that the American Civil Liberties Union did in its amicus brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2331.510" offset="9473631">Those are very broad words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.694" offset="9478333">It is hard to say as a matter of interpretation they apply only to physical conduct or things of that sort.</text>

            <text syncTime="2358.744" offset="9582509">It seems to me it's a sensitive, thoughtful statement of why we aren't legislating more broadly than we are in this murky constitutional waters of disorderly conducts.</text>
