            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="128437">We will hear arguments next in No. 85-1940, United States versus Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.522" offset="170442">Mr. Minear, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="jeffrey_p_minear" startTime="13.058" stopTime="484.030">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey P. Minear</label>
            <text syncTime="13.058" offset="180577">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in 1970, this Court decided the case of Choctaw Nation versus Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.663" offset="215059">That decision effectively held that the Cherokee Nation owns an 87-mile portion of the bed of the Arkansas River.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.733" offset="243271">The Cherokee Nation has since sued the United States, claiming that the federal government's navigational improvements on the Arkansas River have damaged the tribe's riverbed properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.541" offset="282559">The question in this case is whether the tribe's claims are barred by the United States navigational servitude which permits the government to improve navigable waters free from demands for just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.080" offset="328744">The government's brief describes the long history of federal navigation improvements on the Arkansas River and the genesis of the present dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.836" offset="359777">Turning directly to the legal question at issue, I will first address the characteristics of the navigational servitude and then explain why the servitude is fully applicable in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.624" offset="398857">It has been well settled since this Court's historic decision in Gibbons v. Ogden that the commerce clause gives Congress broad power to regulate and improve navigable water for the public benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.416" offset="446086">This Court, construing that authority in light of history and the needs of interstate commerce, has developed the concept of the navigational servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.372" offset="481821">This concept has played a vital role in the commercial unification of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.942" offset="500107">The navigational servitude expresses a general understanding that the determination whether federal navigation improvements have taken property within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment must take into account the overarching public interest in free navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.435" offset="558099">It recognizes the historic fact that navigable waters are especially valuable as a conduit for trade, and that for this purpose they should be treated as public property of the nation, to be used for the common benefit of all of the nation's constituents, and of particular relevance in the present case, the navigational servitude lays down a firm rule that the United States is not required to pay compensation for damage to in-stream property resulting from federal navigation improvements to naturally navigable rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.705" offset="679203">This Court has repeatedly stated that the owner of land beneath navigable waters has a qualified title, not at its absolute disposal, but to be held at all times subordinate to such use as may be consistent with or demanded by the public right of navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.230" offset="741270">This Court has recognized that principle in a number of cases, but perhaps the best example is Lewis Bluepoint Oyster Company versus Briggs.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.253" offset="773348">In Lewis the plaintiff cultivated oysters on land beneath New York's Great South Bay that was originally conveyed into private hands through a royal patent during the colonial period.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.878" offset="815875">The United States dredged the bay to improve navigation, destroying the plaintiff's oyster beds.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.263" offset="837400">This Court rejected the plaintiff's demand for compensation stating that by necessary implication from the dominant right of navigation, title to submerged land is acquired and held subject to the power of Congress to deepen the water over such lands or to use them for any structure which the interest of navigation may require.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.593" offset="914723">As Lewis indicates, it has long been settled that the United States is not constitutionally obligated to pay compensation when federal navigation improvements impair property within the bed of a naturally navigable body of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.253" offset="969371">The same principle is applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.936" offset="980133">Indeed, when this Court confirmed the Cherokee Nation's riverbed rights in the Choctaw Nation decision, it specifically recognized the tribe was subject to the United States navigational servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.911" offset="1024019">The Cherokee Nation nevertheless contends that it should be exempt from the servitude, but there is no basis for creating such an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.667" offset="1055053">The tribe is a part of the United States and is subject just like any of the nation's other constituents to the national government's commerce clause powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.772" offset="1091519">The Cherokee Nation argued in the District Court that the tribe's quasi-sovereign status provides a basis for an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.759" offset="1119418">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.794" offset="1123598">Even the states which exercise the full measure of sovereignty allowable under the Constitution are subject to the servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.464" offset="1154213">Indian tribes, which have only limited sovereignty but the sufferance of Congress, are not entitled to broader rights than the states possess.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.888" offset="1187964">The Cherokee National also claims an exemption on the ground that it received its title through a treaty with and patent from the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.994" offset="1220355">However, that fact does not provide the basis for an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.795" offset="1235611">The tribe, like any owner of land beneath navigable waters, took its riverbed interest subject to the federal government's dominant power under the commerce clause to regulate and promote navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.836" offset="1283781">The United States did not waive its navigational servitude in the treaty or patent, nor was it obligated to make an express reservation of that sovereign power.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.942" offset="1320143">The retention of sovereign authority is implicit in all government agreements unless surrendered in unmistakable terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.048" offset="1348564">Indeed, as the Lewis case demonstrates, even persons who hold property rights that predate the Union are subject to the servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.785" offset="1375523">The tribe suggests that it should be exempt from the servitude because it received fee simple title to the riverbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.855" offset="1399764">However, the Court's confirmation of the tribe's title in Choctaw Nation was premised in part on the fact that the United States implicitly retained a navigational servitude, and in any event this Court has specifically rejected the contention that fee interests are exempt from the government's long-standing power over navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.000" offset="1476355">The tribe also claims an exemption from the servitude based on the United States trust obligations to the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.423" offset="1502060">The tribe's right to compensation, however, depends on whether it has a compensable property right in the bed of a naturally navigable body of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.446" offset="1538213">It is well settled under this Court's precedents that no such rights can exist here.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.647" offset="1554932">As this Court has stated, the application of the navigational servitude is not an invasion of any private property rights in the streams or the lands underlying it for the damage sustained does not result from the taking of property within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment but from the lawful exercise of a power to which the interests of the property owners have always been subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.977" offset="1636329">The United States trust responsibility may in some circumstances create an obligation to administer whatever property rights that tribe might possess but it cannot create a property right where none would otherwise exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.487" offset="1694321">At bottom we are dealing here with a doctrine that is clear and well settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.474" offset="1714279">The United States owes no compensation to any party when the government's navigational improvements impair the private use of lands within the bed of a naturally navigable river.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.680" offset="1755134">That doctrine imposes a common burden on all of the nation's constituents for the common good.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.984" offset="1776346">It cannot admit a special exception for the Cherokee Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.102" offset="1788780">There is no plausible ground for exempting the tribe uniquely among all of the elements that comprise a national union from an otherwise uniform and unifying national rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.125" offset="1828904">There are many good reasons why the tribes' request for an exemption should be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.196" offset="1845204">The tribe's demand for compensation, if allowed, could amount to a multi-million dollar toll on commerce along the Arkansas River, providing a windfall to the tribe at the public expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.586" offset="1890762">Furthermore, the recognition of an exception here would be truly remarkable because the Cherokee Nations have been among the historic beneficiaries of navigation improvements on the Arkansas River.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.775" offset="1935484">Perhaps most troubling, the creation of an exception in this case may encourage other parties to sue the government, demanding compensation for in-stream damages that were previously considered noncompensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.433" offset="1982086">This Court should be reluctant to disturb a long-settled constitutional doctrine that has engendered a century of investment-backed reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.856" offset="2011761">That is particularly true here where Congress itself has examined the tribe's claim and declined to provide special compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.777" offset="2039451">For all of these reasons we suggest that the decision below should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.246" offset="2057319">Thank you, Your Honors.</text>

            <text syncTime="484.030" offset="2064528">Thank you, Mr. Minear.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.698" offset="2071216">We will hear now from you, Mr. Wilcoxen.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. James Wilcoxen</label>
            <text syncTime="487.714" offset="2079261">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.804" offset="2115624">When the United States argues that the navigational servitude and its general rule of no compensation prevents the Cherokee nation from having a compensable interest in the Arkansas riverbed it is limited to previous cases which have no relation to the facts and circumstances in this present unique case.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.801" offset="2191588">When the treaties and patent granting the Cherokee Nation fee simple title to over 14 million acres of land in what is now the State of Oklahoma, I believe that Congress intended to give the Cherokees everything it had to give.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.660" offset="2255013">There is no limitation in words granting fee simple title to a permanent home forever that shall in no future time without their consent be included within the territorial limits or jurisdiction of any state or territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.622" offset="2326902">Of course, this is not to say that the Cherokees were no longer subject to the Constitution of the United States but it is to say that whatever rights were created must be determined from the unique historical circumstances of this case and no other.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.400" offset="2390014">More precisely, while the Cherokee nation is subject to the broad commerce clause power to regulate navigation, the question of whether the exercise of that power affects a taking of property protected by the Fifth Amendment is another matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="581.660" offset="2455007">That may be true, Mr. Wilcoxen, but your opponent suggests that our cases are virtually larded with statements that the exercise of the navigational servitude is not a taking of property even from people because they had no compensable interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.622" offset="2534837">It was always subject to this servitude.</text>

            <label>Mr. James Wilcoxen</label>
            <text syncTime="603.923" offset="2544032">That is correct, Your Honor, Chief Justice Rehnquist, but the cases relied upon by the United States are cases where riparian owners have acquired whatever rights that the States got and it was intended in those situations and always was intended that those grants be subject to the public right of passage.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.355" offset="2633789">I think that Congress's intent in this case was when it gave a direct patent to the Cherokee Nation was that this be the private domain of the Cherokee Nation and that there was no public right of passage--</text>

            <text syncTime="692.464" offset="2898253">So why shouldn't they be treated the same for purposes of the navigational servitude?</text>

            <text syncTime="716.128" offset="2992920">The cases mention a bare technical title that a riparian owner might acquire from the state.</text>

I mean, I am sorry, a private domain for the Cherokee Nation, and that when, to further answer your question, and that when Oklahoma Statehood took place that property passed into trust with the specific provision that the lands would not become public lands nor property of the United States, but would be held in trust for the use and benefits of the Indians.</text>

            <text syncTime="855.968" offset="3552254">They were specifically promised protection against interruption and intrusion from citizens of the United States who might attempt to settle within the Cherokee Nation without their consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.426" offset="3594050">They would be removed by order of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.794" offset="3607529">The treaties also recognized the sovereign right of the Cherokee Nation to make and enact all laws deeded necessary for the protection of their persons and property.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.900" offset="3647967">Cherokee law did prohibit travel in or settlement by intruders and provided for the forfeiture of all improvements made by intruders unlawfully residing in the Cherokee domain.</text>

            <text syncTime="939.121" offset="3884845">Your Honor, I am not trying to say that the Cherokee Nation is excluding the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.977" offset="3920267">What I am saying is that when the United States exercises its power to regulate navigation in such a way that it takes property vested in the Cherokee Nation, that it can create a situation where there has been a compensable taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.973" offset="4004277">The navigational servitude has generally been applied without compensation to those cases involving riparian owners who have acquired title from the state pursuant to local rules of property construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.614" offset="4054850">There is no question that where the equal footing doctrine reserved title for a future state, that navigational servitude applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.304" offset="4085570">In this case, however, the Cherokee Nation was uniquely conveyed title to a great tract of land of which the bed and banks of the Arkansas are only a fraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.343" offset="4125799">The United States states that there is nothing unusual with respect to the navigational servitude about fee simple ownership of riverbed interests, citing cases where states or individuals through states acquired title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.733" offset="4179297">First of all, it is very unusual that the Cherokee Nation was granted fee title to navigable lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.739" offset="4207301">Second, I think this ignores the intent behind the grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.358" offset="4225795">State lands were always intended to be public and individual owners took accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.345" offset="4245753">Cherokee land was intended to be private.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.131" offset="4256933">The Cherokee Nation was not a mere riparian owner but a sovereign nation in many respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.535" offset="4282533">It was promised freedom from state or territorial jurisdiction and the right of self-government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.771" offset="4303431">The Cherokee title as granted was not a qualified one certainly when viewed from the plain meaning of the treaties and patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.925" offset="4332061">These private rights were created without any place for public intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.012" offset="4352437">No state was contemplated in 1838.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.214" offset="4365289">The entire area within the Cherokee domain including the riverbed constituted the private property of the Cherokee Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.451" offset="4398204">The right to develop their property is a vested property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.819" offset="4415653">As this Court has already recognized, neither Congress intended nor the Cherokees understood that they be precluded from developing their mineral rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.859" offset="4455777">After repeated betrayals, a forced removal, and a unique fee patent to their new private home, I would submit that the Cherokees have a reasonable investment-backed expectation to use their property free from public interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.636" offset="4518889">Congress intended to preserve a way of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.005" offset="4536444">In their eastern lands the Cherokees used the streams and rivers as avenues of transportation for food, for irrigation, and other purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.961" offset="4568208">They were not nomadic but settled in towns and villages along the rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.563" offset="4586599">Also it is clear that the Cherokees made money from the use of the rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.884" offset="4603944">In both the eastern and western homes, the Cherokees regulated public ferries crossing the many streams and rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.038" offset="4632574">Cherokee law provided for taxation, licensing, and manner of use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.406" offset="4650024">The United States argues that this Court has never deviated from the fundamental constitutional principle that the United States owes no compensation when the government's navigational improvements impair private interest in navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.951" offset="4712195">The United States cites a long line of cases where the noncompensable loss was related either directly or indirectly to the riparian owner's access to or use of navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.342" offset="4761724">As the Court of Appeals correctly held, a determination of what is compensable or not compensable should have nothing to do with the use of navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.781" offset="4799549">It is the character of the invasion that is determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.482" offset="4814282">In this case there is not a mere insubstantial evaluation, but millions of tons of sand and gravel have been dredged away or rendered inaccessible by rivetment constructions--</text>

            <text syncTime="1597.807" offset="6519660">The Court of Appeals, recognizing that Cherokee property rights are constitutionally protected, directed its opinion to this Court's decision in United States versus Creek Nation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1633.830" offset="6663751">To do otherwise would not be an active management but one of confiscation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.217" offset="6685276">Congress's power to manage and control tribal trust property is not absolute but is subject to pertinent constitutional restrictions, including the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.756" offset="6727386">Furthermore, the duty to manage and control cannot be preempted and subsumed by the navigational servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.928" offset="6764061">Congress's fiduciary responsibility to protect tribal property rights is no less compelling in the face of the navigational servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.884" offset="6799901">The power to regulate tribal affairs and the navigational servitude spring from the same commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.407" offset="6829995">Regulation does not include confiscation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.775" offset="6843474">Congress cannot completely ignore one duty on the one hand to advance another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.513" offset="6866461">Likewise, it cannot simultaneously act as trustee for the benefit of the Cherokee Nation and promote and protect its property interests on the one hand and on the other hand invoke its power to regulate navigation when to do so would take tribal property and use it for a public purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.157" offset="6945038">In any given situation in which Congress has acted it must act in one capacity or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.330" offset="6973668">It is the good faith effort on the part of Congress to give the Indians the full value of their land that identifies the exercise by Congress of its authority to manage property of the Indian wards for their benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.590" offset="7034795">Without that effort, Congress could exercise sovereign power to regulate navigation, thereby destroying tribal property and using it for its own purposes without assuming an obligation to compensate the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.897" offset="7087980">In this case, Congress cannot be presumed to have exercised its navigational servitude with no intent to compensate the Cherokees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.638" offset="7134896">The Court of Appeals noted that special circumstances surrounding the grant to the Cherokee Nation, particularly the series of broken treaties culminating in a new set of treaties and patent uniquely granting fee title to the Cherokee Nations, to their lands in the west, and promising freedom from state and territorial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.320" offset="7221622">In the face of these circumstances, the Court of Appeals found that it must adhere to the principle that treaty rights will not be deemed abrogated or modified absent a clear expression of Congressional purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.561" offset="7274599">The intention to abrogate or modify a treaty is not to be lightly imputed to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.798" offset="7299572">In neither the Flood Control Act of 1944 nor the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1946 was any provision made for the payment of compensation to the Cherokee Nation for the loss of its property, but more importantly, the Acts of Congress do not express an intent to deprive the Cherokee Nation of its trust property without compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.897" offset="7387970">In 1906, this riverbed property, remaining unallotted, passed into trust with the provision that it shall not become public land nor property of the United States but shall be held in trust for the use and benefit of the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.757" offset="7455366">After Oklahoma Statehood, the Secretary of Interior and the Oklahoma State Supreme Court erroneously concluded that the property had passed to the State of Oklahoma, and this misbelief persisted until this Court's decision in Choctaw Nation versus U.S., 397 US 620, in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.603" offset="7542824">When Congress authorized construction of the navigation project it made no authorization to take tribal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.526" offset="7574484">Congressional intent should not be implied to the detriment of the Cherokee Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.180" offset="7597054">When the United States took this property for the McClellan-Kerr project without payment, it violated the terms of its trust provision to hold the property for the use and benefit of the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.321" offset="7645642">There is nothing in the navigational servitude which absolutely binds Congress to an intent to take property without compensation.</text>
