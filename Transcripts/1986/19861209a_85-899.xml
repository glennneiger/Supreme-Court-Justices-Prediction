            <text syncTime="56.920" offset="366588">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="59.622" offset="377455">The respondent in this case, William Barrett, was arrested on a charge of sexual assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.692" offset="401696">Shortly after his arrest, within a matter of hours, he was given four separate sets of Miranda warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.929" offset="426669">He told police officers that he had no problem talking about the incident, but he would not give a written statement without an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.635" offset="461465">The question presented in this case is whether an oral statement given by the respondent is admissible as evidence in the subsequent criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.724" offset="497827">As I just indicated, Mr. Barrett was arrested on a charge of sexual assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.462" offset="520815">At the time of his arrest he was warned in accordance with Miranda versus Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.997" offset="538996">He was then transported to a nearly town.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.233" offset="555923">Upon arriving he was again given his Miranda warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.135" offset="575463">He received a third set of Miranda warnings prior to the actual interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.339" offset="596361">The Connecticut trial court and the Connecticut Supreme Court both found that the defendant stated he had no problem talking to the officers but he would not give a written statement without an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.897" offset="642545">Mr. Barrett then proceeded to give a narrative account of the incident, admitting that he and his co-defendant had intercourse with their victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.789" offset="686118">He claimed, however, that this was a consensual act, despite the fact that during the act he had in his hands a screwdriver.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.060" offset="727182">The police had unsuccessfully attempted to tape record the defendant's first statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.464" offset="748811">In an effort to get a valid tape recording of this statement, they once again advised Mr. Barrett of his Miranda rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.654" offset="777546">Again the defendant repeated that he had no problem talking with the officers but he would not give a written statement in the absence of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.141" offset="811505">The defendant then proceeded to give a narrative account paralleling the first account.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.264" offset="840031">At trial the defendant contended that his two statements were involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.234" offset="859884">However, at the conclusion of a suppression hearing the trial court held that the defendant had made a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of his right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.756" offset="898023">Therefore, the two statements were both introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.208" offset="911816">On appeal, Mr. Barrett again contended that the statements were involuntary, but he added the contention that the statements were taken in violation of Edwards versus Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.599" offset="957373">The trial court's factual finding was basically not challenged by the Connecticut Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.622" offset="989451">Instead, that Court held that the defendant's refusal to give a written statement without an attorney present was a clear request for the assistance of counsel to protect his Fifth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.263" offset="1040025">In reaching this conclusion the Connecticut Supreme Court never considered the fact that the defendant had not invoked his right to remain silent for purposes of that oral interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.987" offset="1086940">Thus, the Connecticut Supreme Court misconstrued this Court's holding in Miranda and in Edwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.943" offset="1126751">This Court has consistently made it clear that the purpose of the Miranda warnings is to dispel that coercion that is inherent in police interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.615" offset="1165412">Additionally, Miranda is designed to assure that a suspect in police custody is adequately advised of his Fifth Amendment rights prior to giving any statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.507" offset="1208985">Custodial interrogation was viewed as inherently coercive.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.577" offset="1229256">However, under the Miranda holdings, holdings, once a suspect has been adequately advised, it is possible for a trial court to find that that suspect did in fact waive his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and that waiver was an act of free will.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.122" offset="1299473">The state does acknowledge that there is a bright line if a defendant does request counsel at the interrogation.</text>

            <text syncTime="341.221" offset="1503855">Of course, at a suppression hearing that would become a factor that would be considered by the trial court.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.888" offset="1614509">Do you think that when someone, a defendant, makes a waiver of this type which is selective or perhaps conditional, that that suggests that there may be some uncertainty on the part of the defendant about what statements can be used against him?</text>

          <turn speaker="julia_dicocco_dewey" startTime="391.152" stopTime="399.823">

            <text syncTime="391.152" offset="1703535">A selective or conditional waiver has never been held to be an equivocal or an ambiguous situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.823" offset="1738225">Well, I didn't ask or suggest that it was ambiguous, but, does it possibly suggest a lack of knowledge of how the statements could be used?</text>

          <turn speaker="julia_dicocco_dewey" startTime="413.167" stopTime="467.032">

            <text syncTime="413.167" offset="1791620">--Under the facts of particular case, it might be possible theta selective waiver, if it were somehow inherently inconsistent, could suggest a lack of knowledge or could suggest that the defendant did not truly comprehend his Miranda rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.927" offset="1850656">But again, that would be a factual determination for the trial court, and in this particular case the determination by the trial court was that that waiver, that selective waiver, was not an indication of an indication of a right to counsel or any uncertainty, but rather that the defendant was so aware of what his rights were that he chose to exercise some of the rights but not the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.856" offset="1942398">He chose not to have counsel present for the oral aspect, as opposed to the written aspect of the interrogation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1086.843" offset="4486307">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.849" offset="4518385">I think it's important in the resolution of this case to focus on precisely what went on and what the findings were of the lower courts, because I think that frames the question that's presented to the Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.907" offset="4562585">The first point to make, I think, in that regard relates to questions that were asked by Justices O'Connor, Marshall and Brennan and Scalia about precisely what the suspect understood he was doing and what he knew about his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.417" offset="4616606">I think it's clear on the record here that respondent testified at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.802" offset="4634160">The trial court expressly found that he understood the nature of his rights, he understood what he had been told by the police, and that understanding of course included the statement that,</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.557" offset="4669164">"Anything you say can and will be used against you at trial. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.926" offset="4682643">That factual determination was nowhere challenged by the Connecticut Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.913" offset="4706571">Nothing in its opinion suggests that there's anything wrong with that factual finding by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.650" offset="4729559">I think that it's also important to recognize that there's nothing inherently contradictory between an understanding of that right, understanding of the consequences of speaking, and the course of action followed by the suspect here where he chose to make an oral but not a written statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.962" offset="4798836">I think it is a common experience, courts have frequently recognized that people simply are reluctant to put things in writing even though they appreciate that their oral statements have legal consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.586" offset="4845334">This Court encountered something very similar to this in Butler versus North Carolina, where a suspect refused to sign a waiver statement but proceeded to waive his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.209" offset="4883786">The Court found that his waiver was effective because not the necessary inconsistencies, so long as he appreciated what he was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.631" offset="4913461">The fact that he didn't make a sensible distinction in his actions is not of any relevance for purposes of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.052" offset="4939166">Courts of appeals and other lower courts have encountered situations almost identical to the one involved in this case where a suspect refuses to put a statement in writing, refuses to sign a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.092" offset="4983365">Those courts have recognized that suspects frequently are simply reluctant to put statements in writing even though they fully appreciate the nature and consequences of what they are doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1464.421" offset="5996602">He stated that he was perfectly willing to speak to the police but that he would not make a written statement without the presence of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.093" offset="6027322">But he had no objection to talking to the police before counsel arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.895" offset="6046549">The question here is the legal significance of this type of partial invocation of Miranda rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.199" offset="6067760">Now, a partial invocation is just that, a partial, limited invocation and nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.686" offset="6089703">The requirements of Miranda are satisfied if the inherently coercive effects of custodial interrogation are dispelled and that is accomplished by advising the suspect of his Miranda rights and honoring whatever decision he makes about whether or not he is willing to speak to the police, make a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.063" offset="6163159">If the suspect freely, voluntarily chooses to invoke his rights only for a limited purpose, which is what the respondent did here, and he then proceeds to voluntarily make a statement to the police, nothing in Miranda or in any of this Court's other decisions would prevent him from doing so or would prevent the police from listening to what he has to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.959" offset="6242780">The difficulty with the Connecticut Supreme Court's decision I think this returns to Justice Stevens' reading of it and exactly what the Court meant to hold the Connecticut Supreme Court, I think understood the meaning of Miranda to be that any time a suspect recognizes the value of counsel in any of his dealings with the police, that all questioning must come to a halt until an attorney is present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.092" offset="6343300">But this idea that the police or the courts have some obligation to safeguard the interest of the suspect more fully than the suspect himself thinks necessary or wants, if completely alien to Miranda which was designed to insure that it is the person who is being interrogated who controls whether or not he is able to make a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.888" offset="6418532">The Court emphasized that its holding in Miranda was not designed to make interrogations impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.423" offset="6440684">It was not designed to prevent suspects from confessing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.208" offset="6451760">And the Miranda rules are not intended to insure that a suspect will always act in his own best interest or will always make the wisest possible decision when he--</text>

            <text syncTime="1649.452" offset="6736808">We may think that it is in his interest to try to talk him way out of it, but that he is reluctant to commit himself in writing because if he wants to change his story, it would be more effective if there is a written statement, that in that case it would only be his word against the policeman's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.545" offset="6793128">So, there are all kinds of entirely rational reasons that a suspect may make the distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.032" offset="6815071">The suspect amy in fact be right, that an oral statement carries less weight with the jury than a written statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.068" offset="6835238">And, again as the Court at least implicitly recognized in Butler and the lower courts have explicitly recognized, people are reluctant to put things in writing even though they appreciate that their oral statements have legal significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.677" offset="6893647">I think, given the fact that the suspect was explicitly warned on a number of occasions that everything he said could be used against him, he stated that he understood that, the trial court found that he understood that, there is no reason for anyone to second-guess that conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2858.330" offset="11572282">Just briefly, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.449" offset="11584717">The defendant in this case was given control over the course of his interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.203" offset="11603734">He was given a choice by the police officers, and the police officers respected that choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.340" offset="11628289">My opponent suggests that what the defendant did in this case was give an ambiguous statement, and that that ambiguity that he alleges mandates a presumption that there has been invocation of the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.315" offset="11680220">But that is a factual question that was never reached by any of the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.219" offset="11699865">He is relying upon a factual determination that was never made by the trial court or by the Connecticut Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.205" offset="11723793">Instead, the Connecticut Supreme Court applied a bright line rule: any time the word "attorney" is mentioned, it is automatically an invocation of a right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.995" offset="11762976">They reached that determination without a factual basis, and therefore their decision should be reversed.</text>
