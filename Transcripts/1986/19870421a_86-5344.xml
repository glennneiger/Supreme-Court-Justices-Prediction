            <text syncTime="80.952" offset="457399">The reason for the longer sentence was that Florida changes its sentencing guidelines law to boost the sentences, and applied that change retrospectively to Mr. Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.308" offset="498882">The state says that increasing his sentence retroactively does not matter, because the guidelines are discretionary, or proecedural.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.414" offset="531274">The serious flaw in that argument, as demonstrated in the briefs, is that departure from the guidelines is not discretionary and is not treated as such under Florida law.</text>

            <text syncTime="331.067" offset="1457889">And the judge's only discretion would be within that range, that 3-1/2 to 4-1/2, 5-1/2 to 7.</text>

            <text syncTime="579.189" offset="2450438">No, because what we have here with these guidelines is what would be an affirmative, enforceable right to receive these guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.426" offset="2479381">And it is the punishment, it is the quantum of punishment for this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.477" offset="2495577">And once there's a change in this quantum of punishment, then you have an ex post facto violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.198" offset="2518461">It's retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.567" offset="2523894">The state doesn't dispute that.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.083" offset="2529954">And it's disadvantageous.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.852" offset="2541030">The sentence went up 2-1/2 years, and there was no departure in this particular case, that he was disadvantaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.541" offset="2567780">So applying the two prong Weaver test, we have an ex post facto violation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.243" offset="2586588">Not only is it difficult to depart, but very important, under Florida law, there is a right to an appeal, an appellate review of this departure, for the validity and proprietary of the stated grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.020" offset="2645729">And if one of the judge's reasons... say he gives two good ones, and a number of incorrect or invalid reasons... the court would still reverse, applying a harmless error test.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.894" offset="2685226">These guidelines and departures have been reversed under numerous grounds, as I indicated in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.048" offset="2709781">Over 60 grounds have been found to be invalid, just to point out to this Court that they are not discretionary, that a judge could deviate from them at will.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.772" offset="2756697">Now under the guidelines in effect in April of '84, Mr. Miller's presumptive sentence would have been the 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 years, but he received a 7 year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.795" offset="2796821">And the reason for that, which I wanted to get to, was that the Florida legislature wanted to increase the punishment for sex offenders by increasing the point total for the sexual offense category.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.119" offset="2842066">The more points scored, the higher the presumptive sentence, or the quantum of punishment for this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.023" offset="2865680">The quantum of punishment was increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.208" offset="2874457">And in approving this amendment, the Florida Supreme Court explained that this amendment to the sexual offense categories will, quote, increase the primary offense points by 20 percent, resulting in both increased rates and length of incarceration for sexual offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.920" offset="2949272">Thus, not only the effect but the intent was substantive; to increase punishment, to increase the quantum of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.424" offset="2979365">Simply put, more people will go to jail under the amended guidelines than under the original guidelines which were in effect; ex post facto violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.263" offset="3014683">And this switch was substantial for Mr. Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.232" offset="3026594">Because since these guidelines points correspond to a predetermined sentencing range, the base sentence for sexual offenses was effectively increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.503" offset="3063688">The effect, as predicted, was to boost the point score.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.105" offset="3078108">And he received a sentence of 7 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.593" offset="3092005">There was absolutely no departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.459" offset="3099424">This was disadvantageous.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.061" offset="3109873">It materially altered the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.247" offset="3118650">And it meets every test of this Court as articulated since 1798 in Calder v. Bull.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.984" offset="3141533">It was additional punishment for the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.417" offset="3151355">And it was precisely what the ex post facto clause was intended to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.840" offset="3181030">The claim has been made by the state that these guidelines are procedural, but they are not under Florida law.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.910" offset="3209243">Because the legislature, in creating the guidelines, recognized that developing sentencing criteria was primarily a matter of substantive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.634" offset="3248217">In Section 921.001 the court... the Florida legislature declared, criminal penalties and limitations on the applications of such penalties is a matter of predominantly substantive law, and as such, is a matter properly addressed by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.763" offset="3320733">In this context, under the Florida constitution, the legislature has the sole responsibility for substantive law, and the court for procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.571" offset="3371933">So here the legislature has declared that these guidelines, the whole guidelines law, is a matter of substantive law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1272.996" offset="5225582">And this Court held, and I briefly quote, we need not determine whether the prospect of gain time was in some technical sense part of the sentence to conclude that it, in fact, is one determinate of petitioner's prison term, and that his effective sentence once this determinate is changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.875" offset="5301128">And I think that's what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.410" offset="5307293">If it's not the sentence, it's a determinate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1296.946" offset="5321399">And it would materially alter the situation to th accused, an resulted in an ex post facto violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.849" offset="5348985">The length of a prison sentence, which is not subject to parole in this particular case, and which is determined by the applicable guidelines, is in the most basic and fundamental sense, a substantive matter, which under the ex post facto clause, cannot be retroactively increased.</text>

            <text syncTime="1355.048" offset="5553785">There are three reasons which support the ruling below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.416" offset="5567264">First, the guidelines are procedural and ameliorative when viewed as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.968" offset="5585550">Second, that there is continued judicial discretion so the defendant cannot show he was disadvantaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.855" offset="5609060">And thirdly, that the legislature has given offenders fair warning that the guidelines are subject to change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.942" offset="5637377">Going first to the ameliorative purpose of the guidelines, the guidelines were drafted in order to guide judicial discretion and reduce disparity in sentencing, and to prevent arbitrariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.185" offset="5686382">However, the punishment for offenses remains the statutory maximum for the crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="1575.720" offset="6436514">In fact, the prosecutor at the sentencing, this issue came up, and the defense attorney argued that the original guidelines were in effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1643.095" offset="6705994">Because in Dobbert, this Court specifically held that when you can only speculate that you've been disadvantaged, but you cannot show an ex post facto violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1658.172" offset="6766284">He cannot show that his sentence would have in fact been lower, because the Court had continued discretion to depart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.611" offset="6792093">Now, Mr. Dobbert, as you recall, had a jury recommend life for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.730" offset="6812573">And under the prior death penalty statute, the life recommendation would have bound the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.484" offset="6835561">Under the new statute, it didn't bind the court, and the court could override the recommendation and did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.787" offset="6860743">However, this Court said that Mr. Dobbert had in no way established that in fact the jury would have recommended life under the old statute, and speculation was not enough to show that this had disadvantageous effect on the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.647" offset="6920198">We submit here that it's clear that the defendant was not subject to more onerous treatment because he certainly could have gotten the same sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.151" offset="6954261">The prosecutor urged the court to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.419" offset="6963352">The Fourth District Court intermediate specifically told the judge, if you want to, you can go ahead and sentence him to seven years again, but just state your reasons; that this clearly shows that there was not a disadvantage, and does not show ex post facto violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2288.037" offset="9285742">But here there is clearly warning to Mr. Miller and other people that the guidelines are going to be annually reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.892" offset="9321164">The parole guidelines cases were... actually, the parole guidelines were one of the bases for this state to develop sentencing guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.850" offset="9365050">On page 56 of my brief I've quoted former Chief Justice Sundberg's article discussing the guidelines before they were enacted, and he said they came from the parole guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.158" offset="9406219">For that reason, I think the cases in that area, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and Justice Rehnquist's decision, which hold that application of amended guidelines is not ex post facto because discretion is still available and because of the fair warning, are clearly on point with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.268" offset="9470689">In the parole guidelines area, departures also are reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.385" offset="9487199">It's administrative review, but the standard is good cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.356" offset="9503081">We submit that's fairly analogous to clear and convincing reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.641" offset="9516247">And again, in the parole cases the guidelines are followed 85 percent of the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.712" offset="9540488">But the courts have held that the fact that they're followed that often doesn't mean that the departures become substantive... a matter of substantive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.235" offset="9578627">We submit that the defendant's cases are distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.139" offset="9594196">As I mentioned, Weaver was a mandatory entitlement, whereas this is discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.876" offset="9621154">The Rodriguez case, cited in the reply brief, involved the elimination of parole hearings, which was not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.362" offset="9651039">We submit that the amendments simply further reduce arbitrariness and guide discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.266" offset="9674653">The defendant was not deprived of a substantial right that was available at the time of his offense, because the maximum punishment remained the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.603" offset="9704015">The amendments do not remove sentencing options, nor do they permit consideration of matters previously barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.990" offset="9729615">Finally, there are policy reasons why the legislature should be able to amend the guidelines and courts apply the amendments that are in effect on the sentencing date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.815" offset="9772874">The guidelines really represent an innovative change from the past manner of indeterminate sentencing, with the parole commission making the decision for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.254" offset="9814670">Now the guidelines effectively the truth in sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.157" offset="9834314">The parole has been eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.676" offset="9840374">And we need to benefit from our experience with the guidelines, and to modify them as necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.747" offset="9868586">Procedurally, it would be difficult for trial courts to be faced with using several different sets of guidelines and having to apply... figuring out which ones apply to which defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.953" offset="9905471">And if it ends up becoming too complicated, it will discourage modification, because it will result in administrative difficulty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2513.949" offset="10189474">Well, anyway, Your Honor, I think that the administrative problems are a valid concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.340" offset="10230957">And I've cited a couple of the bail act cases, where the courts have said that a change in the bail format, which makes it more difficult to get bail on appeal, really only advances the date of sentencing, and is not ex post facto; and that administrative concerns are valid, and the court shouldn't have to deal with two sets of bail statutes when deciding a bail issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.170" offset="10318310">We submit that analysis applies here as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.205" offset="10330431">Therefore, in view of the ameliorative nature of the guidelines, the continued existence of judicial discretion, the fair warning given to offenders, and the policy reasons given, we submit that the Florida Supreme Court correctly relied on Dobbert v. Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.882" offset="10393125">And we request that the judgment below be affirmed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.869" offset="10413083">Thank you.</text>
