            <label>Mr. Lacy H. Thornburg</label>
            <text syncTime="16.676" offset="212937">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the honorable Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="20.878" offset="229760">This is a case arising under The Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act of 1976, 42 USC 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.901" offset="261839">It raises the question as to whether or not attorneys' fees are appropriate in Federal Administrative procedures under Title VI, when there's no connected court action in which the fees are recoverable.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.875" offset="313770">And more narrowly stated: is a recipient liable for fees to private complainants for time spent in resolving their complaint by the voluntary informal means that are provided in Title VI and implementing regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.568" offset="368523">Here no private right of action to enforce Title VI was ever brought in court, and no formal administrative hearings or actions in course to enforce Title VI were instituted by the United States Department of Transportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.078" offset="430485">The essential facts in this action developed as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.263" offset="447308">From the early 1950s the state and municipal and federal officials had been engaged in planning for an east-west expressway through the city of Durham, North Carolina, in compliance with federal laws and procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.141" offset="510733">And from time to time the expressway appeared on the plan and was shown in a broad ribbon showing to pass through the Crest Street community, which was a predominantly black community.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.068" offset="574472">Construction... it was agreed that the expressway would be constructed in segments.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.924" offset="601953">By December, 1971, three segments were either completed or were under construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.493" offset="628180">And at that time an incorporated group know as ECOS, Incorporated, and Duke University students, and some others, filed an action in the Middle District Court of the State of North Carolina against the Department of Transportation, the Commissioner of... North Carolina Highway Commissioners, and others, seeking injunctive relief in that they asked that the construction of the entire expressway be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.780" offset="749388">The present respondents were not party to that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.299" offset="763390">The grounds for relief alleged in that action were: failure to hold public hearings; failure to comply with protection for park lands; failure to prepare an appropriate environment impact statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.724" offset="821068">On February 20th of 1973, the Court enjoined construction on the expressway past those three segments that were then in progress, in construction, until the compliance was had in full with the statutes that were alleged to have been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.322" offset="907481">No Title VI issues were raised in the ECOS action, or contended at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.660" offset="932872">Then for approximately three years, nothing further was done toward additional construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.064" offset="962443">But in late '77, the highway authorities began public meetings, and interest was renewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.485" offset="988147">And at that time they began receiving information to prepare a draft environmental impact statement and holding public meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.805" offset="1021480">And one of these meetings was held in the Crest Street community which was attended by various parties that were interested in the construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.828" offset="1053558">Now, these meetings continued through '77 and '78, and in '77 counsel were sought by the Crest Street group, and began their representation in these informal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.706" offset="1125029">Of course, other groups were attending these meetings at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.158" offset="1138822">And then in September of '78, the attorneys for the respondents filed an administratif complaint with the U.S. Department of Transportation alleging that this... if construction were completed in accordance with the plans that were being proposed, that this would constitute a violation of their Title VI rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.524" offset="1228369">The highway project then continued in the planning stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.343" offset="1251566">And in October of that same year, October of '78, a draft environmental impact statement was filed by the transportation authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.033" offset="1290332">And at that time, after the filing of the administrative complaint, the Department of Transportation said to the parties: See if you can't settle your differences by voluntary dispute resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.793" offset="1345398">And the parties did continue at that time with their informal meetings.</text>

            <text syncTime="308.682" offset="1380924">And that was the Civil Rights Office of the U.S. Department of Transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.434" offset="1399942">These informal meetings continued as they had before the complaint was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.754" offset="1421257">And in February of '80, the... after an investigation, the U.S. Department of Transportation did send the Department of Transportation of North Carolina a letter saying: If you complete this construction in accordance with your proposed plans, we think it would constitute a violation of Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.351" offset="1503595">So in June of '80, pursuant to this, and pursuant to the request from the U.S. Department of Transportation, the parties, various parties including Duke University, VA Hospital, and all the others there, formed a steering committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.212" offset="1567021">And they began to address, in earnest, the differences between the Crest Street Community and the other parties as to where this expressway was to be located.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.651" offset="1612787">And by September of 1981, tentative agreement was reached as to what would be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.607" offset="1644657">And by March, 1982, a preliminary agreement, final environmental impact statement incorporating the agreement, had been reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.530" offset="1684363">And the details were finalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.165" offset="1694916">And by April of 1982, everyone agreed that for all practical purposes the dispute had been resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.087" offset="1730547">Now during this entire period, the respondents had filed no court action--</text>

            <text syncTime="401.158" offset="1750818">General Thornburg, when you say that had been resolved, is it more or less conceded that the bulk of the relief requested had been obtained?</text>

            <text syncTime="433.146" offset="1878818">And we certainly concede that, for all practical purposes, it was obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.616" offset="1904732">And everybody was in agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.568" offset="1912464">And they had decided what would be done, how it would be done, the plan that would be implemented.</text>

            <text syncTime="491.966" offset="2114129">And then the petitioners, we, went into court and asked that it be dissolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.470" offset="2136072">Now, the reason for that was so that we could implement this plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.005" offset="2154253">And everybody knew that that had to be resolved before the plan could be implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.659" offset="2172853">And then in October, after our filing to dissolve the injunction, the respondents, for the first time then, filed a motion with the Middle District Court asking to be permitted to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.120" offset="2250697">And in their proposed complaint, they asked for the same relief essentially that had been filed in the administrative complaint filed with the federal... with the United States Department of Transportation; that being that no further construction be permitted, and that... or that the construction be completely removed from the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.236" offset="2339200">This was after the agreement had been reached by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.788" offset="2357382">And everybody in April had said that the dispute was resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.806" offset="2373473">Now, the respondents were never allowed to intervene in the ECOS action.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.328" offset="2399491">But they did sign a consent judgment in the case when the... when the injunction was dissolved and the action--</text>

            <text syncTime="582.373" offset="2475664">--We really had no serious objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.992" offset="2486217">Because the judgment referred to them as applicants for intervention, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.527" offset="2508369">And their purpose, primarily, we felt, was to see that the... be there in case the plan... we failed to implement the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.300" offset="2543373">And so they were referred to as applicants to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.703" offset="2561032">And they reserved in this judgment the right to seek their attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.809" offset="2593424">One of the things that happened during the course of this series of meetings was, that we were getting nowhere on the attorneys' fees matter, but were able to get down to the crux of the issues, and that was, what was best for the Crest Street community.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.717" offset="2649117">So all the parties agreed that they would just set aside the attorneys' fee issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.521" offset="2664268">So when this judgment was entered, it reserved the right to proceed in case the plan was not implemented; and secondly, reserved to them the right to seek attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.727" offset="2709094">On December 15th, the day after the consent judgment was filed... that was in 1982... then the parties formally executed the mitigation plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.332" offset="2751517">And the implementation program is on schedule as of this date.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.652" offset="2768862">Now this fairly lengthy recitation of the facts points up the accuracy of the District Court's crucial findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.258" offset="2811285">And I would like to review those briefly for the Court, by reason of this Court's deference to what the District Court does.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.447" offset="2840020">And in this case, the District Court held, in its findings of fact, that the respondents never intervened in ECOS; that only 37 of the 1,261 hours that were spent in dispute resolution process involved preparation of pleadings concerning ECOS, or negotiations toward and review of the final mitigation plan; and included in the consent judgment that the ECOS injunction prohibited construction pending compliance with laws other than Title VI; that by motion to intervene the respondents sought to enjoin extension of the highway; and a declaration that the petitioners' practices violated Title VI; that they obtained neither; that the ECOS injunction only prohibited construction pending compliance with laws other than Title VI; went on to hold that there was no showing that their ECOS fee efforts contributed to the execution of the final mitigation plan; that final settlement seemed imminent when the motion to intervene was filed; and that respondents did not show that their efforts in ECOS, in an action where they never parties, was a catalyst to the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.197" offset="3147011">Now those are the things that the District Court found in its crucial findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.518" offset="3176268">Most of those start on page 28 of the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.254" offset="3199256">1988 provides that in any action or proceeding to enforce the provision of Title VI, the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney's fee as a part of the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.716" offset="3269055">2000s-1 directs promulgation of rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.787" offset="3289326">49 CFR 21.1 is a set of rules that the U.S. Department of Transportation promulgated pursuant to that statutory mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.344" offset="3339586">The complainants, or the respondents in this action, filed their administrative complaint under Section 21.1 et seq.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.402" offset="3383785">And under that section, they are required... or the U.S. Department of Transportation is required to seek resolution of disputes by informal means, if possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.995" offset="3446165">That was as far as the parties ever got in this action, was the resolution of the dispute by these informal means that the act refers to.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.970" offset="3498097">Now 2113 provides that if the informal means don't work, then what can be done after that.</text>

            <text syncTime="879.397" offset="3663817">This specifically... these are rules that they adopted pursuant to the Congressional direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.068" offset="3690462">As emphasized in... by Congress in its enactment of 2000d-1, and the U.S. Department of Transportation in its adopted rules, informal dispute resolution and voluntary compliance was hopefully to be realized without the necessity of court actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.566" offset="3772487">The parties... the respondents never became parties to any proceeding to enforce Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.886" offset="3805715">They did, in fact, become involved in the administrative enforcement process by calling to the attention of the U.S. Department of Transportaton a potential violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.312" offset="3855452">And thereafter, they, along with various others, participated in this dispute resolution process.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.501" offset="3892232">And they participated in the informal discussions that were initiated by the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.489" offset="3916160">And the negotiations, we contend, did not amount to private enforcement proceedings under the act; and that their role was participants, simply in this voluntary dispute resolution process; and that from the time the complaint was filed, their participation was permissive.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.568" offset="4004454">Now, this Court, in Cannon, recognized the limited and permissive nature of a complainant's role in its holding concerning Title IX, and therefore Title VI, where exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required before the filing of a private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.399" offset="4079791">Now in the context of this case, the Congressional design for administrative enforcement relies on the federal agency as the enforcer.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.588" offset="4120542">And the main thrust is to obtain recipient compliance by voluntary means.</text>

            <text syncTime="1159.092" offset="4782590">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.488" offset="4848209">Respondent's claim for attorney's fees fails, on our view, for two principal reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.356" offset="4867644">First, their claim misapprehends the role of private enforcement in Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.344" offset="4887602">Because of Title VI's inherently consensual basis, Congress fashioned an administrative enforcement scheme for Title VI different than that provided for in other civil rights laws, such as Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.401" offset="4935876">To best achieve the purposes of Title VI, Congress chose not to confer upon persons claiming discrimination the status as parties in the administrative enforcement scheme; and consequently, Section 1988 does not apply to their activities in that setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.029" offset="5002332">The second defect in respondent's claim is that it rests on an unduly expansion construction of the term 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.302" offset="5043396">They claim that agency investigations and informal negotiations urged on by the federal agency constitute proceedings to enforce Title VI within the meaning of Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.042" offset="5090417">We do not believe that Congress intended such an expansive meaning for the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.346" offset="5107657">Of the two defects in respondent's claim, the more troubling to the United States is the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.500" offset="5136183">And that is, their misapprehension of the role of private enforcement in Title VI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.904" offset="5157813">Title VI's nondiscrimination mandate is uncompromising, yet simultaneously, it's fragile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.142" offset="5186756">It depends, therefore, for its ultimate accomplishment, on the maintenance of a bilateral relationship between the federal agency and the recipient of federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.651" offset="5240777">Unless that relationship remains intact, Title VI's nondiscrimination mandate is frustrated and becomes meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.757" offset="5273274">We believe for this reason Congress established an administrative enforcement scheme in Title VI notable in two primary respects: first, the lack of party status for persons claiming discrimination; and second, a heavy dependence on voluntary means of resolving charges of discrimination as reflected in the statutory language, 42 USC 2000d-1, which refers to the words of voluntary meanings of resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.561" offset="5404513">We think that application of Section 1988 would undermine the Congressional scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.298" offset="5431367">Federal recipients might be less likely to participate in the informal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.119" offset="5454668">Or, even if they were willing to participate, less willing to compromise their position, for fear of opening themselves up to liability for attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.558" offset="5492493">Sure, in other settings, it might be said that the threat of imposition of attorneys' fees might promote settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.200" offset="5531050">But in Title VI, it also increases the chances that the recipient will circumvent, indeed, frustrate Title VI's mandate by decline of receipt of federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.023" offset="5578280">Indeed, the absence of attorneys' fees in the informal process encourages the recipient to settle a case in that process rather than waiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.113" offset="5614642">The balance, we agree, is a difficult one to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.565" offset="5628435">We believe the language and structure of Title VI, in 602 and 603 of the statute, suggest that Congress intended to err on the side of informality, at least in the initial stages of agency enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.825" offset="5685486">Congress determined, we believe the language reflects, in contrast to Title VII, Congress determined that a more formal role for respondents, persons claiming discrimination in an administrative setting, would impeded and not further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.000" offset="5746195">In effect, Congress erected a safe harbour within Title VI to allow for the promotion of voluntary settlement in informal negotiations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1463.075" offset="5998537">Because there's no clear incentive to just file a preemptive lawsuit at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.145" offset="6018809">For instance, in this case, if a lawsuit had been filed at the outset, at the same time the administrative complaint had been filed, under our analysis they still would not be entitled to attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.000" offset="6058201">Filing a lawsuit changes the analysis, but it wouldn't change the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.904" offset="6073875">You would still have to look to see whether the lawsuit was the catalyst for the agreement reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.690" offset="6092996">In this case, the catalyst for the agreement reached was the administrative process, and would not have been a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.010" offset="6114312">So absent an incentive to just go ahead and file a preemptive lawsuit, because it wouldn't change the result, we don't believe that people would necessarily file those lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.652" offset="6156840">And if they did, they would be going against, in certain respects, the best interests of their client, which would be to participate in the informal administrative process, and to achieve, as respondents did in this case, an agency preliminary finding of reasonable cause, which no doubt helped considerably in the negotiation process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1730.776" offset="7069349">Mr. Calhoun, while we're on the text of the act, it doesn't say that you're entitled to fees with respect to any action or proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.434" offset="7119922">It says, in any action or proceeding to enforce a certain number of provisions, among which is not 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.356" offset="7159628">In such an action or proceeding, the court, in that proceeding, may award reasonable attorneys fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.561" offset="7196513">Now, it is possible, when there is an appeal from a Title VII denial, or even from denial of some action under Title VI, perhaps even the very action at issue here, where there is an appeal to the court from that, one could regard that as being one entire proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.792" offset="7277388">So that the court, in that proceeding, could award attorneys' fees not just for the participation in court but even for the participation at the administrative stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.933" offset="7322005">But this suit before us here is not an action or proceeding to enforce a provision of Sections 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985 and 1986.</text>

            <text syncTime="1817.965" offset="7418031">The defendants in this case have argued that the statutory language saying that the court is to make the award of the fees indicates an intent by Congress to exclude fees for administrative proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1833.975" offset="7482084">What troubles me is that the statutory language clearly envisions that it is the court in the action or proceeding that can award the fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.532" offset="7532343">And we are not... or the courts below were not... the court in an action or proceeding to enforce 1981, 82, 83, 85 or 86.</text>

            <text syncTime="1875.016" offset="7646237">And there the Court explicitly stated that it would be utterly anomalous, and contrary to the intent of Congress, to say that if you go through the administrative proceeding and you win and then don't have to go to court, you get no fees; but if you go through the administrative proceeding and lose and have to go to court, then you can get fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.965" offset="7734113">The unsuccessful administrative complainant gets fees, while the successful one is denied that.</text>
