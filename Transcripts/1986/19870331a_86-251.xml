            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="134629">We will hear arguments next in No. 86-251, Rockford Life Insurance Company against Illinois Department of Revenue, et al.--</text>
            <text syncTime="10.356" offset="176007">Mr. Griswold, you may proceed when you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="55.468" stopTime="585.998">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="55.468" offset="356461">May it please the Court, this case is here on appeal from the Supreme Court of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.083" offset="442874">The question, summarily stated, is whether certificates of the Government National Mortgage Association, popularly known as Ginnie Mae and I shall refer to it as Ginnie Mae in the argument, guaranteed as to interest and principal by the full faith and credit of the United States, pursuant to an Act of Congress, are subject to an ad valorem property tax of the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.202" offset="571396">I will seek to show that the bonds are exempt from taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.222" offset="595429">First, under general constitutional principles, including the Supremacy Clause, since the unqualified Government guarantee which they contain is the key and essential element in carrying out an important policy deliberately adopted by the Government of the United States under the Commerce Clause and in providing for the general welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.429" offset="728340">And, second, pursuant to the express terms of Section 742 of Title 31 of the United States Code, in which the Congress has long provided, since the Civil War, that, and I quote:</text>
            <text syncTime="169.676" offset="813290">"All stocks, bonds and other obligations of the United States shall be exempt from State taxation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="180.901" offset="858221">Rockford Life Insurance Company bought the bonds involved here in 1977 at a time when Illinois did not impose its property tax on Ginnie Mae bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.593" offset="920915">However, on December 31, 1978, the Illinois Department of Local Government changed its rule and imposed the tax for 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.103" offset="979011">That led to administrative and Court proceedings, as a result of which the tax was sustained by the Supreme Court of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.394" offset="1028121">Rockford then brought the case here and this Court noted probable jurisdiction on November 10th.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.301" offset="1071798">In considering both the constitutional and the statutory questions, it is important to have a clear picture of the history of the Government National Mortgage Association and the role which it plays in the housing policy of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.916" offset="1170227">The origins go back more than 50 years, to 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.404" offset="1196245">Some of us remember and others have learned that real estate markets then were moribund.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.795" offset="1237728">Housing starts had dropped from 937,000 units in 1925 to 93,000 in 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.788" offset="1293734">Foreclosures were at epidemic levels, as this Court's decision in Home Building and Loan Association against Blaisdell clearly records.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.999" offset="1366564">Before that time, many efforts had been made by insurance companies and others to insure mortgage debt but the experience was disastrous.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.907" offset="1422257">It was in this situation that President Roosevelt established a Commission to explore housing finance and out of its report came the First National Housing Act, enacted in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.590" offset="1512954">One of the proposals embodied in that Act was the grant of authority for the creation of Federally chartered, privately owned national mortgage associations with power to buy and sell mortgages and issue bonds against them to the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.372" offset="1600098">Several national policy objectives were expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.657" offset="1621205">One, to provide new sources of mortgage funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.061" offset="1638864">Two, to provide liquidity for mortgage lenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.363" offset="1656000">That is, marketability and I suggest that is a very key element here.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.184" offset="1679302">Three, to lower the cost of mortgage funds by increasing the supply of funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.337" offset="1703961">And four... and this is another important one... to move mortgage funds from localities where funds were available to areas where credit was in shorter supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.032" offset="1770730">Despite the authorization and the hopes that lay behind it, the program under the 1934 Act was a complete failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.340" offset="1815974">No private mortgage association was ever established under the program and in 1948, fourteen years later, the program was repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.647" offset="1869160">In 1938 the Federal National Mortgage Association, sometimes called Fannie Mae, was chartered.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.853" offset="1905940">One of its purposes was to create a secondary market for mortgages, thereby channeling Federal credit to the housing industry but Fannie Mae did not issue mortgage backed securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.398" offset="1972187">In 1954 it was reorganized under a new charter as a mixed ownership Government corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.170" offset="2011266">It's secondary market function was to be financed by bonds, by funds borrowed in the private market and these obligations were not secured by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.347" offset="2071974">It was a number of years later, in 1968, thirty-four years after the beginning of only meagerly successful efforts in this area, that Fannie Mae was divided into two corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.725" offset="2141460">One of these, Ginnie Mae, Government National Mortgage Association, was established as a wholly-owned Government corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.051" offset="2190779">The other corporation retained the Fannie Mae name and Government ownership in it was terminated on September 30, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.776" offset="2241666">By the terms of the statute, Ginnie Mae is, and I quote Section 1717(a)(2)(A) of Title 12 of the U.S. Code:</text>
            <text syncTime="541.386" offset="2300076">"Ginnie Mae is in the Department of Housing and Urban Development. "</text>
            <text syncTime="546.856" offset="2322018">"It has no Board of Directors and its powers are, by statute, exercised by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. "</text>
            <text syncTime="558.247" offset="2367576">"It has a President who is nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. "</text>
            <text syncTime="565.334" offset="2395893">"Its other officers are appointed by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. "</text>
            <text syncTime="572.138" offset="2423165">Thus Ginnie Mae is unquestionably an instrumentality of the United States and its obligations are clearly, in the normal sense, obligations of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1713.355" offset="6988010">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.794" offset="7025731">I would like to first talk for a moment, if I might, about the Ginnie Mae certificates themselves and who is obligated on the face of the certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.816" offset="7061885">As the Court pointed out, the certificate itself states that the issuer, who is named on the face of the certificate, undertakes to promise to pay to Rockford Life Insurance Company payments of both principal and interest on the certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.493" offset="7124578">In addition, I would like to point out that as the Appellate Court noted in its opinion, the certificates involved in this case are what is generically known as modified pass-through certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.633" offset="7169091">That is, the issuer undertakes to pay both principal and interest, not only as a straight pass-through, that is, as those payments are received by the mortgagor... paid in by the mortgagor, but whether or not those payments are received.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.143" offset="7231158">Specifically, I would like to invite the Court's attention to page 57, in the center of the second paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.881" offset="7258116">The line I'm referring to reads:</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.833" offset="7265953">"However, the issuer shall pay to holder, whether or not collected by the issuer, and shall remit as set forth below, monthly payment on both principal and interest. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1810.400" offset="7376190">However, counsel for the taxpayer here tries to make that the determinative factor in the case and we strongly disagree with such excessive reliance on simple enforceability by the holder of the certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.443" offset="7436376">There are other agreements, as pointed out by both the Appellate Court and the Supreme Court, in rejecting this argument of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.380" offset="7464066">The issuer has promised, not only on the face of the certificate but also in the guarantee agreement which is signed with Ginnie Mae and, as pointed out by the Court in the opening argument, Ginnie Mae is the one who enforces this obligation of this issuer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.356" offset="7524043">It is not the holder of the certificate but it is Ginnie Mae.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.391" offset="7536164">But certainly the issuer, in this case the Kissell Company, is liable on these certificates and that liability is enforced.</text>

            <text syncTime="2525.780" offset="10237747">Default, as pointed out by the statistics which are reproduced in several of the briefs, are quite rare and, therefore, it has not been shown that the State taxation imposes any real impediment to the success of the Federal program or interferes in any significant way with the operation of the program.</text>

            <text syncTime="2555.899" offset="10358224">Contingent liability as of that year was 175 1/2 billion dollars a actual liability amounted to $98,532.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.607" offset="10400960">To require the States to refrain from taxing a program in excess of 215 billion dollars on the basis of liability somewhat less than $100,000, is not a sensible construction of constitutional or statutory tax immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.669" offset="10481209">Furthermore, the task which the taxpayer proposes in this case completely ignores the real consideration whenever this Court seeks to determine whether securities should be exempted from State taxation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2611.720" offset="10581414">In this case, the immunity which the taxpayer seeks, would primarily serve to shield private investments from State taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.326" offset="10611925">So that immunity is not mandated either by the Constitution or by the Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.230" offset="10635540">Unlike stocks, bonds or Treasury bills, Ginnie Mae certificates are issued by private banking institutions, not the Government and those private institutions are primarily liable on these certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.487" offset="10688516">The Government's liability is contingent and unliquidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.989" offset="10702518">The issuance if Ginnie Maes does not increase the public debt, nor does it secure funds for the operation of the Federal Government and these were essentially the tasks which this Court stressed in the Smith case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.082" offset="10762913">In Smith the Court looked to several factors, but the factors which essentially we would ask the Court to consider here are, first of all, there is no credit instrument or instrument which is utilized by the Federal Government in order to raise revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.876" offset="10830100">This is the most important factor because, essentially, what this Court is doing when it says the State cannot impose a tax on these obligations, it is excluding an entire area from the ability of the States to impose taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2942.336" offset="11903942">Such immunity should not be conferred in the absence of a decision that it is necessary to the success of the Federal program and we submit that decision is one which should be made by Congress--</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.310" offset="11951798">Here Congress has never indicated either in the statute creating Ginnie Mae, that these bonds... that it intended to, in the language itself nor in the legislative history, is there any indication that it intended, when it authorized Ginnie Mae to guarantee these obligations, that it intended to confer immunity from State taxation and this Court has many, many times indicated that the question of whether the constitutional and statutory immunity should be expanded is one which is best left to Congress, because it is a question which is essentially legislative in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.304" offset="12115742">Congress here has not indicated that immunity from State taxation is necessary to the success of this program.</text>
