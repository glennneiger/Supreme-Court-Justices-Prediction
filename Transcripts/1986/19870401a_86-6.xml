            <text syncTime="61.722" offset="394300">The issue in this case is whether the State of Arizona can prosecute John Adamson for the crime it dismissed when it entered into a plea bargain with him after he breached the plea agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.916" offset="455113">As we were selecting the jury to try Mr. Adamson for the murder of Don Boiles, he struck a bargain with the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.522" offset="493565">He would testify in four different cases in return for a sentence of 48 to 49 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.276" offset="524599">If he refused to testify or refused to be interviewed in reference to preparation for trial in this specific instance in any of these cases, the agreement was void and he would be subject to the original charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.856" offset="602862">Adamson testified in three of the four cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.908" offset="623028">One was the murder of Don Boiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.360" offset="632850">On his testimony Dunlap and Robison were convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.830" offset="654793">When their convictions were reversed on appeal in March of 1980, Adamson refused to testify at their retrials.</text>

            <text syncTime="148.077" offset="739743">I wouldn't classify it a rush to judgment, Your Honor, but I would say this, although it does not appear in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.414" offset="765134">I... we were concerned as to the problems not sentencing him would raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.318" offset="796690">This was a unique case in many ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.270" offset="804527">One of the unique features about it is that Mr. Adamson all during the time he was testifying up until the time of sentencing had been in local custody which was really a county jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.010" offset="851443">That facility, as most county facilities in the State of Arizona, are not really adequate for holding anyone for an indefinite period of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="256.724" offset="1174316">Mr. Adamson wrote us a letter saying he would not testify unless we made additional concessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.098" offset="1219874">We told him that we would not make more concessions and that his refusal was a breach of the agreement which reinstated the original charge which included a possible death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.942" offset="1275253">We tried to force him to testify but he refused and we re-filed the original charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.679" offset="1302107">He attacked that re-filing unsuccessfully in the xx court immediately, and then with a special action in the Arizona Supreme Court, arguing in both instances that the re-filing was barred by double jeopardy principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.640" offset="1370026">We then did two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.525" offset="1385595">We filed a response to the special action in the Arizona Supreme Court urging that Court to construe the agreement and determine whether he had breached it, and then we also filed a motion in the trial court seeking to have Dunlap's retrial continued because it was just a week away.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.708" offset="1474306">After those two convictions were reversed by the Arizona Supreme Court, those cases were separated although they had started out as one case.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.961" offset="1503250">So, what we were facing were two retrials, one for Dunlap and one for Robison.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.348" offset="1520804">The first one was set, as I said, just a week away was the retrial for Mr. Dunlap.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.252" offset="1544419">The same day that we did these two things, Adamson moved to withdraw his Petition for Special Action.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.958" offset="1583289">He later said in one of his federal habeas corpus pleadings that he did that when it became clear to him that the question of his breach might be decided by the Arizona Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.035" offset="1635534">The Supreme Court refused to dismiss his petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.736" offset="1654342">They set the matter for a hearing and Dunlap's pending trial was stayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.240" offset="1680360">It was now clear what Adamson was trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.377" offset="1696974">He was trying to delay a judicial determination of whether he had breached the agreement until after the Dunlap trial started, with no resolution of that question, and the jury seated in the Dunlap trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.356" offset="1772834">If we wanted to pursue Dunlap, we would have no choice but to accede to Adamson's demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.112" offset="1807942">The only other choice would be to forget Adamson as a witness and dismiss the cases against both Dunlap and Robison, and Adamson was betting that we would not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.204" offset="1860292">Adamson lost in the Arizona Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.990" offset="1875443">They decided that the plea agreement included retrials and that Adamson had breached the agreement and they reinstated the original information.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.481" offset="1925389">That was on Thursday.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.000" offset="1939495">The stay of Dunlap's trial was lifted on Friday, the following day, and his trial was set for the following Monday.</text>

            <text syncTime="490.695" offset="2110231">When we decided that we did not have John Adamson as a witness, we moved to dismiss the cases against Dunlap and Robison, and Dunlap's was dismissed on that Monday, the day set for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.656" offset="2182016">Adamson then was tried and convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.457" offset="2197271">His conviction was affirmed on appeal by the Arizona Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.761" offset="2214512">He then went into federal court with a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.481" offset="2233320">The Ninth Circuit held that we could not prosecute Mr. Adamson on the original charge because of the lesser included offense rule of Brown versus Ohio, and secondly, that Adamson did not waive his double jeopardy rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.842" offset="2306777">We believe that the circuit court was wrong on both of those counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.246" offset="2328406">First, the circuit court drew its own conclusions as to the meaning of the plea agreement and Adamson's letter to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.971" offset="2367276">It should not have done that, as that was a question for the Arizona courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.958" offset="2391309">That was, we contend, a matter of Arizona law and it was composed of determinations on factual issues, both things which are commonly set aside for decision by a state court, and once made, entitled to great deference and as to factual issues in a habeas corpus case, a presumption of correctness.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.823" offset="2490783">If, then, the finding of the Arizona court that Adamson breached his plea agreement is accepted, the next question is whether anything prevented prosecution on that original charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.516" offset="2553477">The Ninth Circuit said that Brown versus Ohio prevented the prosecution but we do not believe that that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.206" offset="2588272">As this Court noted in Jeffers versus United States, there are exceptions to the Brown lesser included offense rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.645" offset="2625993">One of those exceptions is where the defendant asks for two trials, or where his deliberate actions result in two trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.602" offset="2669879">In this case, Adamson's deliberate breach resulted in two trials and he knew that would be the result of his breach for he had agreed to that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1140.697" offset="4710251">There is no need in this case for a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of double jeopardy rights above and beyond that which is clearly contained in the plea agreement itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.838" offset="4758839">Indeed, in Scott this Court has held that when it is the defendant's action that brings about the need for successive prosecution, concepts of waiver need not be invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.896" offset="4810979">The Court's decisions in the appeal cases and the mistrial cases have not rested on waiver rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.216" offset="4836266">To take another concrete example, in Jeffers the defendant objected to the government's attempt to have the continuing criminal enterprise and conspiracy counts all joined in one trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.659" offset="4894048">When he failed in that effort, he... I am sorry, when he succeeded in that effort he surely was not entering into a Johnson v. Zerbst knowing and voluntary waiver of his right not to be free of double jeopardy, because it wasn't until this Court's decision in Jeffers that it was clear whether CCE and the underlying conspiracy were greater and lesser included offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.710" offset="4998329">Nonetheless, this court held that because of the defendant's action it was appropriate for him to be tried separately on the greater and lesser included offenses in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.600" offset="5049843">The fundamental question in this case is whether a defendant can breach his plea agreement but nevertheless prevent charges from being reinstated as the plea agreement said they would be, on the grounds that the double jeopardy clause automatically prevents reinstatement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1426.766" offset="5854519">That April 9th conversation appears to be a breach of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.284" offset="5872595">It was not Mr. Adamson's position that this was a disagreement that needed to be gotten before a court as quickly as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.508" offset="5913451">Indeed, Mr. Adamson resisted the State's attempt to get the agreement construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.329" offset="5936752">On page 86 of the Joint Appendix there is a very clear statement by Mr. Adamson's counsel to the Supreme Court of Arizona that Mr. Adamson has never asked any court to construe this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.970" offset="5987325">His position was that he did not want the agreement construed, and as Mr. Schafer suggested in his argument, the timing of the Dunlap and Robison retrials is critical to take into account in terms of what was going on in the month of May, 1980, when this action was being brought before the Arizona Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.764" offset="6058483">It is the position of the United States that there really is no double jeopardy issue in this case, and despite the holding of the Ninth Circuit, respondent's brief doesn't place most of its effort in an attempt to say that there is any real double jeopardy issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.464" offset="6149284">Their position is that there is something special and unusual about this case, that somehow it was fundamentally unfair for the Supreme Court of Arizona to find the breach it did in this case because there was just a good faith disagreement and as soon as it got resolved Mr. Adamson was willing to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.175" offset="6220128">First of all, I don't know what federal constitutional issue that raises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.579" offset="6245728">At best, in some extreme case, there might be an argument that an insupportable state finding of breach violated due process, but this is not that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.701" offset="6290241">There is ample evidence in the record that Mr. Adamson refused to testify unless his demands were met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.290" offset="6316573">The agreement, as interpreted by the Supreme Court of Arizona, made clear his obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.479" offset="6357324">The Ninth Circuit and the district court, the first time they had heard this case, found the interpretation of the agreement to be eminently reasonable, and we submit, correctly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.085" offset="6391805">We think that this case was summed up extremely well by the Ninth Circuit in 1981, the first time it considered this precise issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.195" offset="6448230">As the Court said, on page 161 of the Joint Appendix,</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.248" offset="6468396">"In his written refusal to testify, and list of demands, Adamson acknowledged that he ran the risk of reprosecution for first degree murder under the terms of the plea agreement. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1603.279" offset="6560556">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.233" offset="6584380">This case most certainly does involve a double jeopardy issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.303" offset="6604651">Mr. John Adamson was in prison serving the second year of a prison term for the murder of Don Bolles when he was charged with the murder of Don Bolles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.194" offset="6652194">Now, the issue here arises at an unusual context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.781" offset="6674555">The context has to do with... and begins with an agreement between attorneys and a disagreement over what the terms of that agreement were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.554" offset="6713634">Like most such disagreements, it arose because something happened that nobody anticipated when the agreement was entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.326" offset="6748742">What everybody anticipated, when the agreement was entered into, is that Mr. Adamson would plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.249" offset="6776432">He would tell the State who else was involved in this murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.700" offset="6794195">He would testify against those people and he would testify against others involved in other crimes and at the conclusion of that testimony he would be sentenced and after that, in a separate provision of the agreement, it said he would be transferred from Pima County Sheriff's custody into a different form of custody which turned out to be Federal Witness Protection program custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.518" offset="6893565">Mr. Adamson did plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.201" offset="6904223">He did solve this crime for the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.887" offset="6914986">He did testify against these other people, and not just once or twice or five times or ten times, but he counted 14 times, 31 days, 190 hours, in court, 205 he counted and it is undisputed, interrogative sessions outside of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.252" offset="7000458">He waived his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.368" offset="7004951">Now, that includes some occasions after the breakdown of the plea agreement where he continued to voluntarily cooperate with federal authorities in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.208" offset="7044239">What happened that was not anticipated was that after the State sentenced Mr. Adamson, and he was sentenced after he testified in all those cases and everybody was convicted, and after he was transferred into federal custody one of the convictions was reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.902" offset="7115084">It was reversed on a ground that required Mr. Adamson's immunity agreement to be renegotiated because the State for some reason, and it's not in the record... and I'm at a disadvantage here because I have to stick to the record that's before this Court, and of course there has never been an evidentiary hearing on these questions and I was not counsel at this stage... but for some reason the State refused to give Mr. Adamson immunity as to a receiving stolen property crime that involves selling an illegal suit that got tied up in this set of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.791" offset="7242561">Because of that he took the Fifth Amendment and there was cross examination limitations during the Dunlap and Robison trials, and that was why their cases were reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.098" offset="7287805">So, when that happened everybody knew that there had to be further negotiations between Mr. Adamson and the State because that changed his situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.037" offset="7323541">Mr. Schafer said so in the newspaper, and Mr. Adamson read that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.405" offset="7345066">Mr. Adamson's counsel said so, and in fact, there were negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.940" offset="7359172">They started discussing, what are the terms and Mr. Adamson's position and his lawyer's position was,</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.761" offset="7382473">"We have performed. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.027" offset="7387593">"We have testified time and time and time again. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.813" offset="7402744">"We have been sentenced. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.581" offset="7409745">"We have been transferred. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.117" offset="7415910">"Our part of the bargain has been completed. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.568" offset="7429702">"So for further testimony, we want further considerations. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.603" offset="7449869">Primary in his mind was safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.305" offset="7460631">This is an extremely volatile, dangerous case involving allegations of organized crime and governmental corruption, and Mr. Adamson's safety was placed in the record by Mr. Schafer as the reason why they couldn't find a place for him in the State of Arizona and had to transfer him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.850" offset="7526878">For his own safety, is what Mr. Schafer said back then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.319" offset="7540671">Mr. Adamson's lawyers took a tough position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.421" offset="7557075">In Mr. Adamson's words in that letter of April 3rd, he asked for the moon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.206" offset="7580272">That was their position in negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.675" offset="7590094">He said it may have been untutored, but it was in good faith because in that letter he never said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.078" offset="7611724">"I repudiate this agreement. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.346" offset="7616844">"I want to go back. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.230" offset="7620396">"I want this to be undone. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.780" offset="7626561">He said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.500" offset="7645474">"This is how we read this agreement. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.167" offset="7645369">or his lawyer said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.536" offset="7653624">"This is what we agreed on when we entered this agreement, that we would testify and then we would be sentenced, and that has been done and now there has to be additional consideration and here is the consideration that we demand. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.027" offset="7707541">He did not say, and it is important to remember the context that we are in here of negotiations between attorneys, and frankly there is nothing in the record that there was any meeting on April 2nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.233" offset="7752367">We have a footnote regarding the reference to April 9th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.518" offset="7765533">We know nothing about any such meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.286" offset="7772638">There has never been an allegation of any of those two things happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.238" offset="7784445">Again, we have a problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.738" offset="7790401">There has never been an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.190" offset="7796253">But I know nothing of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.156" offset="7804089">The question that has been raised, and what I understand to have happened, is there was this call on April 2nd and the response was this letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.462" offset="7833242">And the letter did not say, John Harvey Adamson hereby refuses to testify in any further cases, signed William Feldhacker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.067" offset="7867724">The letter said, here's our legal position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.436" offset="7881203">Here is how we construe the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.686" offset="7890189">Here are the additional items of consideration we wish in addition to testimony, and if you find that there is an absolute prohibition to any of these we can anticipate that Mr. Adamson will not testify in any future trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.433" offset="7965213">Now, that is bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.052" offset="7975662">That is negotiating position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.285" offset="7984543">That is not a breach of the plea bargain agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.187" offset="7996142">The plea bargain agreement never said anywhere, you will not write a letter, you will not assert a position through counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1979.464" offset="8065314">Well, I think it is an inartful letter asking for negotiations, Your Honor, and I think that both sides in this case, if they were at this point the negotiations broke down, and I think partly because of these kind of miscommunications between counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.522" offset="8121529">The position Mr. Schafer has described his response as taking... of trying to get Mr. Adamson to go along.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.295" offset="8148592">It's not how Mr. Adamson said, and his counsel have placed on the record, that they interpreted it, they interpreted it as, "You have already breached", and that is how the Solicitor General read it in their brief here in this Court and that is how I read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.019" offset="8195508">"We may now prosecute you. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2015.737" offset="8210346">Therefore, then, Mr. Adamson did not refuse to testify, or did not testify at this pretrial hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.910" offset="8243051">Justice Rehnquist, it is important for me to differentiate, I think throughout this, the contract questions and the waiver questions and the syllogism that Mr. Schafer's argument proceeds with, which says he agreed, if he breached, he would be reprosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.503" offset="8309506">He breached; therefore he can be reprosecuted.</text>
