            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="80.535" offset="476244">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.606" offset="504560">The issue in this case concerns the timing of a tax deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.610" offset="528593">Respondent is obligated under its collective bargaining agreement to reimburse its employees for certain medical expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.782" offset="557328">The question is whether its deduction of those reimbursement payments should be taken in the year in which the reimbursement claims were filed, evaluated by respondents' claims processors, and paid, mostly 1973, as we contend, or whether, in the alternative, respondent can accelerate this deduction into the previous year by computing and deducting a statistical estimate based on its past experience that is said to represent claims that can be expected to be filed in 1972... excuse me, expected to be filed later and ultimately paid in later years for medical services obtained by employees in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.693" offset="720959">That is what the Federal Circuit held.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.876" offset="729631">The background of this case can be briefly stated as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.429" offset="747917">Prior to 1972, respondent provided medical insurance for its employees by means of contracts that it entered into with outside insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.785" offset="789295">Beginning on October 1st, 1972, respondent terminated this coverage and took upon itself the responsibility of reimbursing its employees directly for their medical expenses, though it retained the coverage and benefit scheme that had been in effect under the insurance company plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.997" offset="862124">At the same time, respondent transferred to its own books the so-called IBNR reserve, incurred but not reported reserve, that had been established on the books of the insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.339" offset="915519">This account is a standard one kept by insurance companies, an actuarial estimate intended to reflect their potential reimbursement liability for medical expenses that have been incurred but have not yet been reported to or evaluated by the insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.135" offset="982706">At the close of 1972, the estimate in this reserve account was $5.5 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.372" offset="1011649">In 1977, respondent filed an amended return for 1972 in which it sought to deduct this figure as a business expense incurred during the year 1972 on the theory that its employees' visits to the doctor created a fixed and definite obligation for respondent to make a payment, presumably in the aggregate amount of $5.5 million that they deducted, even though respondent did not in fact effect any reimbursement until an employee filed a claim and the claim was evaluated and approved in whole or in part by respondent's processors in 1973 or in the later year.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.901" offset="1193775">Respondent's effort to deduct the amount of its IBNR reserve is not permitted by the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.107" offset="1226585">This is a classic example of a reserve that is generally not permitted to be deducted by ordinary taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.594" offset="1256573">It is not an amount that represents a real liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.564" offset="1272456">It is an aggregate estimate based on statistical analyses of past experience of predicted future liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.384" offset="1303698">It is an amount that stays on the books of the respondent in perpetuity and is adjusted year by year to see how the estimate is working out, but it does not purport to be a determination of an amount of a particular liability based on the actual facts that give rise to that liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.132" offset="1378722">Now, it is okay for insurance companies to deduct such a reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.267" offset="1395231">That is specifically provided for by the Code, and Aetna and Prudential, the companies that used to administer these plans, the companies that used to insure respondent, were entitled to take this deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.974" offset="1442043">That is because of the special problems involved in reporting insurance company income, because they take a lot of premiums into income in Year One, and if they did not use this sort of reserve accounting system there would be a serious mismatching of income as to when the premiums are taken in earlier and the benefits are paid out later, but it is clear that this particular deduction is not available, is not available to a regular taxpayer, and respondent in fact does not even rely on the insurance company provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.266" offset="1591254">As Justice Brandeis said in Brown v. Helvering, these insurance company provisions are special technical provisions enacted for insurance companies that do not apply to other taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.038" offset="1634304">In general, reserves are not deductible by taxpayers unless they are specifically authorized by the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.859" offset="1657605">Now, in the AAA case this Court specifically rejected the notion on which respondent relies here of using aggregate statistical estimates as a substitute for actual facts about individual expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.786" offset="1713298">We quoted the pertinent part of that at Page 42 of our brief, and I would like to read it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.023" offset="1738271">"When a company projects an expense on a statistical basis. "</text>
            <text syncTime="400.509" offset="1756139">and I am now quoting,</text>
            <text syncTime="402.376" offset="1763662">"without regard to individual expense but consistently with overall experience, its accounting doubtless presents a rather accurate image of the total financial structure, but it fails to respect the criteria of annual tax accounting and may be rejected by the Commissioner.

            <text syncTime="418.388" offset="1827715">Mr. Horowitz, that quotation might be read to refer to the second prong of the all events test, the amount, the accuracy of the estimate of the amount, and as I understand it you don't challenge that point of the decision below.</text>

            <text syncTime="946.042" offset="3938304">I should reiterate, though, that it is really not necessary for the Court to get that far here, because it is clear that the previous step, the filing of a claim, is necessary before there can be... before there can be any obligation on respondent's part to make a payment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1614.072" offset="6610422">The first ground is that they are not... they just can't take an estimation like this that is not related to the actual facts involved, and the second ground is that the claim has not been filed, and if you get past those two hurdles, then I think on the third ground, although that is our position, I think that is the most difficult question that is presented to the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1647.729" offset="6745109">The Milwaukee case involved an attempt by the Milwaukee Transit Authority to take a deduction for estimates of what it was going to have to pay out on accident claims for accidents that it had in a particular... in a taxable year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.191" offset="6814908">They went through and found that they had about 400 some accident reports from their drivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.261" offset="6839150">They went through these accident reports one by one and made an estimate of what they thought their liability was on each accident report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.999" offset="6866108">In fact, the record says that the attorneys were authorized to settle the cases for that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.085" offset="6894529">And then they totaled up all their estimated liabilities for these accidents and set up a reserve account to pay for them, and tried to deduct that in that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.460" offset="6939982">The Seventh Circuit originally allowed this deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.614" offset="6956596">It stated that it was clear that each individual liability here was not accruable because it was contingent, it was contested, a well established proposition, but it held that all of them lumped together were statistically accurate enough that they could be deducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.826" offset="7029426">Now, this Court vacated that decision in light of AAA, sent it back to the Seventh Circuit, which agreed that AAA made that decision wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.645" offset="7060773">Now, I think what is important to note here, respondent dismisses this case by saying that, well, it is well established that these were contested liabilities, and so therefore you can't accrue them, but if respondent's position here is correct, if they can use this estimation, than Milwaukee will be able to take these kinds of deductions because they will just step it back one step the same way respondent has done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.595" offset="7152515">They won't even bother to look at each individual claim and leave themselves open to the possibility that it is contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.499" offset="7176129">They will just take some actuarial estimate of what their accident liability is based on past experience for a given year, and they will take a deduction for that, and they will be able to do it the same way that General Dynamics does it here if in fact the Court approves this method.</text>

            <text syncTime="1777.262" offset="7263169">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issue in this case is when it is proper to take a deduction for the liability that the taxpayers have for medical benefits provided to their employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.755" offset="7317190">The government presupposes the answer by saying that this is a future contingent liability which we are trying to deduct at the end of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.145" offset="7358777">First, I would like to keep in mind the difference between the cash basis and the accrual basis of accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.566" offset="7384377">The cash basis of accounting for a deduction requires actual payment of the claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1814.353" offset="7411545">The accrual basis of accounting doesn't require payment, it requires that there be an established liability, and that is typically prior to payment of the item.</text>

            <text syncTime="1829.647" offset="7472776">Both parts have to be met in order to take the deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.349" offset="7487509">The first part of the test is that all events have occurred which establish the fact of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.305" offset="7515408">The second part of the test is that the amount has to be determinable with reasonable accuracy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3001.500" offset="12160188">I believe there was, and there has been a constant fight and reanalysis over insurance company taxation throughout the years before Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.725" offset="12205014">I would like to point out that the government, while it says that the dollar amount of the reserve on the second issue is not before the Court, it somehow suggests that the aggregate basis of determining the reserve is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.805" offset="12285367">In the petition for certiorari the government stated at Page 13, Footnote 2, we are not presenting for review here the question of respondent's ability to satisfy the second part of the all events test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.898" offset="12349733">It didn't we are not submitting part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.783" offset="12361331">It said we are not submitting the issue of their ability to satisfy the second part of the all events test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.289" offset="12391319">And that is the reasonable amount portion of the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.591" offset="12408560">So the only issue that is before the Court is whether the fact of liability exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.680" offset="12436877">Now, in our case the government, the authorities of this Court support that claims processing does not preclude deductibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.171" offset="12494869">Starting with the Anderson case in 1916, there a tax was imposed on the sale of munitions, and the taxpayer said, I think that the time to deduct the tax on munitions is in 1917.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.383" offset="12559653">At year end 1916 the munitions had been sold, the tax statute existed, but the tax had not been assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.722" offset="12593089">I expect the return hadn't been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.757" offset="12601135">The year had to close before you could file your tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.959" offset="12613987">Yet the government, contrary to its position here, said no, the munitions tax for 1916 should be accrued in 1916 even though it is not assessed, even though it is not due, and this Court agreed with that and determined that while technically tax had not been assessed and wasn't due, in a practical sense, in a realistic sense all of the events establishing that liability had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.597" offset="12744495">That failure to need a tax assessment shows that paper processing such as involved in this case is not the kind of paper processing which requires that fixation and liability await the end of paper processing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.392" offset="12823698">The government said in its argument that it is a very difficult process, and they cited preexisting conditions and they cited prevailing rates and said in the court below we show this is a difficult process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.770" offset="12889213">It is an iffy process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.420" offset="12895796">The record in the court below is totally to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.508" offset="12912201">Evidence was presented before the trial court on exactly what happened in claims processing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.994" offset="12934144">Those very kinds of situations, prevailing rates, preexisting conditions were testified to by claims processors, and these witnesses testified that while terms which may be unfamiliar to you or I or other laymen are not unfamiliar to the claims processors and they handle these conditions on a routine basis, applying the plans in mass volume numbers, and it doesn't cause processing problems at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.835" offset="13073533">Now, the government at Page 7 and 8 of their reply brief suggest that the same example of a per diem charge for a medical benefit for a hospital stay will result in different answers if you present it to different processors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.014" offset="13162245">That is just not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.283" offset="13171336">The government looks to an example in the respondent's brief at Pages 22 and 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.937" offset="13197876">The example posed was a simple, basic medical plan that paid $60 a day for room and board charges in a hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.126" offset="13234657">The employee is there for three days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.412" offset="13243852">He is entitled to $180.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.613" offset="13252629">The government says, oh, another processor could come up with $210, and their citation for support of that is testimony by a witness who is talking about a plan that has not only a basic medical feature, it has also a major medical feature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.675" offset="13332877">And the addition of the major medical feature means that additional dollars are paid to the employee, but if you have got two different plans you will have two different results on the same facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.835" offset="13385540">If you have the same plan, a basic medical plan, two or more processors will indeed reach the same determination as to what the benefits are that are due to that employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.808" offset="13437367">If you add another tier of benefits, you will, of course, get a different answer, but you have got a different medical plan that is at issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3474.408" offset="14051767">In conclusion, the benefit payments that were made in this case on a practical, reasonable basis show that the events that established the fact of liability had occurred when the employee had been to the doctor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3718.899" offset="15029791">I will use a few more, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.384" offset="15035643">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.301" offset="15039404">The basic issue here is whether there is a fixed obligation to pay the amount that the respondent is seeking to deduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.276" offset="15083290">That includes a couple of things, and I would like to make a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.228" offset="15095097">First of all, whether or not they know, they could know something about the claims by going to see what is sitting in their in box or taking a survey of their employees is not relevant here because the number that they computed has nothing to do with any of that knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.469" offset="15152044">That number is purely a historical estimate and would be the same even if they had no knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.273" offset="15171270">Now, our position is that you cannot do that, and that you don't even get into the all events test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.943" offset="15189974">That is an impermissible means of doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.876" offset="15197706">If they did go around to all their employees and surveyed them as to what claims they had outstanding or what claims they were going to be filing next year or something, then this would be a different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.398" offset="15235741">Then we would not be raising that first objection, and then we would get into the second part of our contention, which is whether the all events test in fact is satisfied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.504" offset="15276178">And our position there is that it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.123" offset="15286627">There is no fixed obligation to pay at the time that the employee goes to the doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.527" offset="15308257">The employee may have an obligation to pay the doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.896" offset="15325706">The employee may have a right to seek reimbursement from the employer, but the employer has no obligation to pay anything to the employee until the employee files a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.584" offset="15360502">Now, there is... in a sense there is a legal liability in the way that lawyers are used to talking about it, which is that ultimately down the road there may be a lawsuit brought at which the employee will recover something and the liability that results in this recovery dates back to when he went to the doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.181" offset="15434898">But that is not what we are talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.681" offset="15440854">We are talking about a fixed obligation on the part of the employer to make the payment, and that just does not exist at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.335" offset="15467499">It does not exist until the next year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.021" offset="15474186">On this business of whether we have waived our entire case by not raising the second issue in the petition, there is a big difference between the accuracy point, which is just whether the bottom line is correct or not, and the question of whether the method by which this amount is computed is legitimate, and I think as the Court has said that goes to the fact of the liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3855.421" offset="15575855">That goes to the essence of the all events test, and we certainly do not agree that this is a permissible method for using... for using to reach this deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.294" offset="15615352">The all events test as first stated by Justice Brandeis, and I don't think the regulation was intended to change it, says that all the events must occur which fix the amount and determine the liability of the taxpayer to pay it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.102" offset="15666552">The two are entwined together, and here the amount that they are seeking to deduct just comes out of the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.655" offset="15692779">It has nothing to do with the events on which they claim there is fixed liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.559" offset="15712423">And it has to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.459" offset="15715976">In order to apply the all events test you have to have... be computing the amount based on the real events that are there.</text>
