            <text syncTime="13.424" offset="196581">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.926" offset="210583">In June of 1984 this Court held in INS against Stevic that an alien's burden of proving eligibility for withholding of deportation to a particular country under Section 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is to show that it is more likely than not that the alien would be subject to persecution if sent back to that country.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.045" offset="331060">In the present case, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit correctly recognized that the Board of Immigration Appeals has consistently taken the position that essentially the same standard, although formulated in various ways, also applies to an alien's burden of proving eligibility for the greater benefit of asylum under Section 208(a) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.702" offset="465747">The Court of Appeals, however, rejected the Board's interpretation and remanded the case for reconsideration by the Board under a standard devised by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.378" offset="524470">This Court granted certiorari to resolve a conflict in circuits about whether the Board's interpretation of the statute is a permissible one, entitled to be upheld by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.685" offset="577656">The Board of Immigration Appeals, whose interpretations are binding by regulation on district directors and other Immigration and Naturalization Service employees, has been recognized by this Court as the expert body whose interpretations of the immigration laws are entitled to judicial deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.622" offset="689460">And after this Court's opinion in Stevic and the conflict in the circuits developed, the Board re-examined at some length its position with respect to Section 208(a) in an opinion which we reproduced in the appendix to the petition for certiorari, called Acosta, beginning on page 29A of the appendix to the petition for certiorari and taking up the remainder of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.760" offset="821953">And I commend that opinion to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.395" offset="836477">There the Board carefully considered the legislative history of the Refugee Act of 1980, its international law background, the judicial opinions that have commented on it, and, as the Court knows, the Board determined that its position had been correct all along, and it had good reasons for doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.747" offset="949953">The question is whether the Board's interpretation is a reasonable one that should be upheld, reasonable in the sense that it is not precluded by the statutory language or by the legislative history or by the sense of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.978" offset="1030828">And we submit that there are three categories of reasons why the Board's interpretation is a reasonable one, entitled to judicial deference.</text>

            <text syncTime="320.558" offset="1425172">And it's just part of the legislative background which the Board has considered as a whole.</text>

            <text syncTime="350.360" offset="1544395">That has always been the Board's position, that a clear probability or likelihood or what this Court called in Stevic more likely than not, three formulations which the Court recognized as equivalent in Stevic, are for practical purposes the same as well-founded fear of prosecution; that while the verbal formulations differ, as the Board put it, for practical purposes the standards converged.</text>

            <text syncTime="414.270" offset="1799977">The first category is that the Board's position takes a coherent view of these interrelated provisions of the statute, so that they make sense considered as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.779" offset="1866015">It must be remembered that asylum provides greater benefits in two important respects than does what was before the Court in Stevic, the right to withholding of deportation to a particular country upon a proper showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.443" offset="1948666">In one respect asylum is broader because it grants a right not to be deported anywhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="502.244" offset="2151899">Although it's true, of course, that asylum is a broader right than just the withholding of deportation to a particular country, is it not... isn't also the converse true, that under 208(a) surviving the threshold to establish eligibility does not establish a right to asylum, but merely a right to have the Attorney General exercise his discretion and decide whether or not to grant asylum?</text>

            <text syncTime="529.561" offset="2261195">But it should be remembered that this is a highly structured exercise of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.501" offset="2292960">It is not an ad hoc determination about individuals by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.469" offset="2312813">In practice, this is an exercise of discretion dealing with more than 10,000 asylum claims per year, an exercise of discretion which is made by the 33 district directors and by the 60 immigration judges whose decisions are reviewable by the Board of Immigration Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.651" offset="2401525">And the discretion is exercised in accordance with legal standards that are set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations and that have been developed in Board of Immigration Appeals decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="802.055" offset="3351128">I'm sure the argument could be made that once the court determined that Congress intended two different standards to apply, it would be an abuse of discretion for the Attorney General to in effect repeal that difference by regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.434" offset="3420614">We could argue that his discretion under Section 208(a) should be interpreted that broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.306" offset="3460111">But of course, it could be a more awkward way for the law to be administered, even if such a regulation were upheld, because then we would be in a position of deporting people to countries where they have shown that they meet the statutory standard of showing a sufficient probability that they would be persecuted in that country, and nonetheless we would be deporting them.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.892" offset="3578498">And we don't believe that the law requires the Attorney General to make that call.</text>

            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="871.485" offset="3628862">Mr. Wallace, if your first answer to Justice Scalia is correct, then the Attorney General would have the power under the statute to adopt a regulation substantially adopting the standard, perhaps saying except in very exceptional cases on a particularized showing or something like that, you must meet the same standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.530" offset="3697094">What you're basically arguing for here is to give your client less discretion than your opponent thinks he should have.</text>

            <text syncTime="897.386" offset="3732516">But there are virtues in this field of delicate international relations and international obligations to having the Attorney General being able to point to someone's failure to meet the statutory showing that is required in order to qualify for asylum status on the basis of fear of persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.405" offset="3860516">And we don't invariably argue for broader discretion than we think the law confers on us.</text>

            <text syncTime="979.338" offset="4060300">That is the other major difference between asylum and deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.658" offset="4081512">Within one year after asylum has been granted, the alien is eligible to achieve legal permanent residency, which in turn then can lead to citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.017" offset="4142952">And the answer for practical purposes is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.921" offset="4158625">Whereas someone granted withholding of deportation is left standing in the same line he was standing in prior to that, waiting to come in under a quota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.915" offset="4218602">He doesn't in any way advance toward achieving permanent legal residency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.734" offset="4249845">Those are the main differences, and they are the key to the coherence of the Board's position here, that aliens facing a lower probability of persecution than is required for withholding of deportation should not obtain the greater relief available to asylees while being ineligible for the lesser relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.206" offset="4375755">Rather, the greater relief is available within the Attorney General's discretion to a reduced category of those who qualify for the lesser relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.431" offset="4420686">As I began to tell the Court, that has recently been done with respect to refugees from Afghanistan who have entered this country from Pakistan on the basis of forged entry documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.142" offset="4491530">Because of the way they gained admittance to the country, the Attorney General through the Board has refused to grant them asylum, and these days a case like Stevic is a great rarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.985" offset="4550880">Everyone asks for withholding of deportation or asylum, rather than just the withholding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.389" offset="4576480">The Attorney General has refused to grant them asylum, but because this was not a serious crime he has granted them withholding of deportation to Afghanistan and the great majority of them have subsequently been deported back to Pakistan, where this is something worked out through international negotiations with Pakistan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.188" offset="4675641">It depends on Pakistan's willingness to take them back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.925" offset="4690583">They have been willing to take back some 90 percent of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.277" offset="4704062">So that is a very meaningful difference between the two standards, which adds coherence to the Board's position.</text>

            <text syncTime="1170.896" offset="4826524">Of course the same thing could have been doable with respect to the particular persons, but the point that I'm making, the coherence in the Board's position, is that those who do not even qualify for withholding of deportation should not be granted the greater benefit of asylum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.543" offset="4909071">In some instances you might have... if you had the thing the other way around, you might have persons who would not qualify for the withholding of deportation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1207.069" offset="4971242">Perhaps in the circumstances we might choose to deport them to Pakistan as well, if Pakistan would take them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1243.344" offset="5116274">If somebody qualifies for asylum, however, if there's a lower threshold and he qualifies for asylum, then he can't be sent back to Pakistan.</text>

            <text syncTime="1258.604" offset="5177296">--Well, there's always the possibility that the Attorney General will achieve the same result we are saying the statute achieves, through an exercise of discretion that gets back to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.579" offset="5221287">Let me rather briefly mention the other two categories of considerations that support the reasonableness of the Board's interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.951" offset="5262769">One is the legislative history and background of the Refugee Act of 1980, and it's important to recognize that there were two propositions established in our law at the time Congress acted that are highly pertinent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.098" offset="5339360">One is, as we have recounted in our brief, asylum had been created by regulation prior to its first statutory recognition in the 1980 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.774" offset="5397979">And those regulations had been amended in 1979 to state explicitly, as we point out on page 17 of our brief, that the standard for proving asylum is the same as the standard for proving withholding of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.937" offset="5486691">The Court recognized this in Stevic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.223" offset="5495781">And against that background, both the Senate report and expert testimony before Congress referred to asylum and the new provision as not changing the substantive standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.518" offset="5569029">Now, questions have been raised about the authoritativeness of these statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.839" offset="5590240">It is true that the conference report didn't repeat that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.123" offset="5607376">The Senate's version of the bill on this subject wasn't the one adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.944" offset="5626707">Nonetheless, there was no express repudiation of any of these considerations, and the Board has reasonably relief on this aspect of the law, of the legislative background, as indicating that Congress did not intend to digress from what had been the established law with respect to asylum at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.512" offset="5732973">And the other thing that was established in our law is that the well-founded fear of persecution language had itself been interpreted prior to its use in the 1980 law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.735" offset="5781874">That was first interpreted by the Board in the Dunar case, where a claim was made that because of that language in the protocol the standards for withholding of deportation should be changed, and the Board said in effect that they concluded that it was essentially the same standard as they had been applying in Section 3243(h) for withholding of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.435" offset="5884692">And two Courts of Appeals had upheld the Board's view on that, the Fifth Circuit and the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.207" offset="5915726">We recount that on page 25 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.492" offset="5928891">And no court at that time had held to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.444" offset="5940699">That was the state of the law at the time Congress adopted that very language in the Act, and Congress did not say it was using that language with any different meaning than had been established in the law at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.787" offset="6002034">That too entitled the Board to rely on Congress' use of language that had been authoritatively interpreted as meaning the same thing as those authoritative interpretations, rather than attributing some other meaning to that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.784" offset="6082074">And the last category of reasons why the Board's interpretation is reasonable is because there is no authoritative source for any other interpretation to give content to the meaning of "well-founded fear of persecution".</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.566" offset="6173189">The Court of Appeals merely says, well, it should be a subjective fear combined with some objective basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.172" offset="6207566">Well, if the alien's country is persecuting any persons on the basis of their political views and the alien has applied for asylum, which could be interpreted as a hostile act, there's always some objective basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.633" offset="6281440">There isn't much guidance in the standard developed by the Court of Appeals on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.422" offset="6316653">And the Board, with its vast experience in administering this statute, has concluded that the practical standard is the familiar one that it has utilized right along.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.832" offset="6374227">I'd like to reserve the balance of my time, if I may.</text>

            <text syncTime="2404.925" offset="9762622">The answer to that I believe is found also in Stevic, that because refugee admissions were not required our accession to the protocol back in 1967 did not affect our refugee admissions procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.983" offset="9810896">The fatal flaw in the Government's argument that regulatory asylum should be adopted as the standard also goes back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.570" offset="9837228">There was no standard for regulatory asylum in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.438" offset="9852692">In 1965, what Congress was talking about at that time, at the time of our accession, was the good reason to fear standard in the predecessory section of 203(a)(7), which is what we have been saying over and over and over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.681" offset="9905669">That's what the legislative history shows, and the Government has never come up with an answer as to why the specific standard for regulatory asylum which they finally set forth in the 1979 regulations, that standard was expressly rejected by Congress in its actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.810" offset="9978185">And the Government has never come up for a justification how to avoid Congress' clear intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.397" offset="10004516">In interpreting legislative history, again, it's a canon of construction that the court does not lightly disregard what Congress has considered and explicitly refused to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.521" offset="10052999">The Government, yes, they proposed a formulation of the bill and that formulation, which would have said in essence that if someone qualifies for, show a clear probability of persecution, then they are eligible for asylum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.964" offset="10114753">Congress took that cut.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.733" offset="10121858">Congress said if someone is a refugee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.768" offset="10133979">And the other major flaw in the Government's argument, that they have never responded to in their briefs or in their argument today, is about the fact that there's another asylum provision, another refugee admissions provision that they are failing to discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.408" offset="10184552">And that's Section 207.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.777" offset="10194060">Section 208, which is the issue in this case, and Section 207 both go back to a definitional section in 101(a)(42).</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.316" offset="10228229">That is where "refugee" is defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.918" offset="10238573">That is where the well-founded fear language comes from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.387" offset="10252470">It does not apply, as this Court pointed cut in its textual analysis in Stevic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.606" offset="10269398">That well-founded fear of persecution does not apply to the withholding of deportation provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.893" offset="10290505">It does not mention it, it is not referred to, nor is the language comparable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.980" offset="10310880">And the Government has never explained how it's going to apply two different statements to refugees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.783" offset="10338047">That is far more anomalous and far more unworkable than what we are proposing to do here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.937" offset="10362707">The Government is going to treat refugees who are currently in Afghanistan differently from those who are at the United States borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.841" offset="10390292">And that again was explicitly discussed in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.159" offset="10403562">It was that lack of uniformity of procedures that Congress was hoping to address, was planning to address, and specifically did address.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.999" offset="10442955">And that's what the Government seeks to ignore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.736" offset="10465838">Another major flaw in the deference argument is the fact that the agency's interpretation which it relies so heavily on, the decision in Dunar, is sheer dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.277" offset="10512023">Dunar was a case very much like Stevic, which simply held that accession to the United States... United Nations protocol did not alter the standard under Section 243(h), and any further discussion was dicta, and I think that's an important factor to remember.</text>
