            <text syncTime="11.539" offset="193382">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.760" offset="206339">This case arises from the conviction of Stincer by a jury for first degree oral sodomy of two girls ages seven and eight.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.865" offset="242701">Both girls and a four year old boy testified at trial in Stincer's presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.833" offset="262554">All three described how he blindfolded them with socks and said he was feeding them a pickle.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.904" offset="286900">The question in the case, whether he was denied his right of confrontation arises from an in chambers preliminary hearing in which the judge determined whether or not the children were competent to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.397" offset="336846">Stincer asked to personally attend that hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.516" offset="349281">His request was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.133" offset="355759">But counsel was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.218" offset="364118">On appeal, the Kentucky Supreme Court held that Stincer had an absolute right to be present at the competency hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.823" offset="398495">From the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Section 11, of the Kentucky Constitution confrontation clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.446" offset="437052">This Court granted Kentucky's request for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.112" offset="447710">It is our position that the state court erroneously extended the right of confrontation in the Sixth Amendment to a non-adversarial preliminary hearing and that Stincer fails to meet the threshold requirements of due process for a right of presence under that clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.228" offset="532138">We also believe that the state court erred by refusing to consider whether the alleged claims were harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.299" offset="560455">It's first necessary to consider the nature of a competency hearing in Kentucky and in most other jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.821" offset="594518">At this competency exam of the two girls that is in issue, it's a very limited hearing with a very limited purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.677" offset="625970">There are no facts of the case discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.962" offset="639135">Guilt or innocence is not an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.581" offset="649584">There are only a dozen or so general questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.532" offset="661392">How old are you?</text>
            <text syncTime="129.598" offset="665676">Where do you live?</text>
            <text syncTime="130.883" offset="670796">Where do you go to school?</text>

            <text syncTime="133.601" offset="681663">Do you know your teacher's names?</text>
            <text syncTime="136.203" offset="692112">The test is whether the children understand the difference between a truth and a lie, the obligation to tell the truth, and whether they are sufficiently intelligent to recall and relate past facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1247.322" offset="5136585">But just as this Court said in Watkins v. Souders, that counsel has no right through due process to question an identification witness prior to trial, and to cross examine that identification witness on suggestiveness; it is our position that where there is no reasonable relation to the opportunity to defend, there is no right of presence in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.687" offset="5238045">Should this Court decide that there is a right of presence, then of course, there would be a need to balance the competing interests of the defendant and the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.328" offset="5284543">I've discussed very briefly Stincer's interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.613" offset="5297709">They are primarily that incremental contribution that he might make above and beyond that of counsel and above and beyond that which he might make at trial, an incremental contribution he might make to the reliability by being present at the competency hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.790" offset="5358417">He says, you know, he may know when the child is not telling the truth and we appreciate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.861" offset="5378688">And, it might be helpful to him, but just as in Pennsylvania v. Ritchey, it would have been helpful to him to personally examine the documents there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.216" offset="5412125">That does not grant the right of confrontation or due process, the right of presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.286" offset="5432396">His rights are protected at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.572" offset="5445562">The best evidence of his lack of contribution is what happened at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.640" offset="5465833">Nothing different at all came out and there was never any challenge either at the conclusion of the hearing or at trial or on appeal as to the competency of these two witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.117" offset="5519749">In terms of Kentucky's interest it is to provide that maximum possible psychological shelter for a child victim consistent with the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.174" offset="5567919">And again, we are concerned with the protection of defendant's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.393" offset="5580771">The nature of the crime, typically a trusted adult, there are often threats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.780" offset="5606371">The greatest fear of the child is facing the abuser again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.034" offset="5627374">Common sense tells us that child will be frightened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.319" offset="5640540">And each additional confrontation will frighten that child more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.707" offset="5658094">It is our position that how the child is treated initially may well affect the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.361" offset="5680664">In this case, the first child as she went into the competency hearing and defendant was excluded, after a few question said, I'm not afraid anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.132" offset="5723818">Me and my sister were afraid about who would come up here, but I'm not afraid anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.953" offset="5747015">The child was in an atmosphere in which she wasn't confronted by the defendant and began to calm down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.571" offset="5769584">Then later during the trial, potentially because of many reasons she again said she was scared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.559" offset="5793513">She was scared of everyone there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.511" offset="5801245">If you will, this is a narrowly tailored and a well calculated procedure to minimize the damage to the child while fully preserving the defendant's constitutional rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1554.953" offset="6367057">Though it is not articulated specifically anywhere in the constitution, the right to be present at ones own trial is one of the most fundamental of all the rights that we have in our society.</text>

            <text syncTime="1576.200" offset="6452007">And, it has been held to be implicit in the right of due process in the case of Snyder v. Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.222" offset="6484190">By excluding the defendant from this important, critical hearing which the Supreme Court of Kentucky deemed critical, this important right, the right to be present was violated, which resulted in a denial of confrontation, denial of due process and also a denial of the right to effective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.088" offset="6579589">This Court has held that we must, at all times, be alert to factors which can undermine the fairness of the fact-finding process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2739.656" offset="11105878">But, in this case Kentucky has a competency hearing for the purpose of determining competency and it is at that point that the defendant's constitutional right applies, and his due process right applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.748" offset="11166273">And at that point, he has the opportunity to assist.</text>

            <text syncTime="2762.687" offset="11198038">It is a major, practical problem to expect the defendant to have to go into that again in front of the jury and risk alienating the jury, which I submit and there's case law discusses this, would happen in most cases to have to go into these other facts which are unrelated to the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.249" offset="11272226">Certainly we also submit that there is a clear due process issue involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.188" offset="11307962">Under Snyder v. Massachusetts the defendant has the right to be present wherever his presence bears a relation reasonably substantial to the fullness of his opportunity to defend against the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.246" offset="11356236">Plainly in this case, as I've mentioned, the defendant is frequently the person, the only person who knows things about the child's background.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.037" offset="11399390">Kentucky has a two part test for competency, the intelligence to observe, recollect and narrate the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.858" offset="11426662">All kind of factors can go toward the intelligence of the child, toward the ability to remember and recollect the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.796" offset="11454456">There may be specific instances in the child's background which the defendant is aware of which directly show that he doesn't have the ability to recollect the facts or the answers he's giving at the competency hearing are not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.306" offset="11512448">The other part of the test concerns the ability to, the sacred obligation to tell the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.595" offset="11557588">If the defendant is aware of many instances in the background of the child where he has repeatedly exhibited a pattern of untruthfulness it's very possible to show that he really doesn't understand the difference between truth and falsity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.589" offset="11609624">These are specific things the defendant can do and I would point out that in a case such as this, in most cases of this type, child sex abuse cases, the defendant is well-acquainted with the family and the victims as he was in this case and he is in the position to know these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.502" offset="11693215">Counsel is not in the position to know them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.704" offset="11706068">We can't expect the prosecutor to bring out these kind of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.572" offset="11717562">It's the defendant and only the defendant who is in a position to know these things and the only way for him to be able to assist at the level of competency is to bring these, is for him to be present at the competency hearing and for him to have the opportunity to consult with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.318" offset="11800526">I've also raised the issue of effective assistance of counsel in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.687" offset="11821947">We would submit that plainly the action of the court in excluding the defendant also relates to the issue of effective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.309" offset="11856533">This Court has held that any time a procedure of the court which interferes in certain ways with the ability of counsel to make independent decisions about how to conduct the defense, when that occurs a violation of the right to effective assistance of counsel has taken place under Strickland v. Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.075" offset="11943573">That's precisely what happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.342" offset="11952664">The action of the trial court resulted in an ability on the part of defense counsel to make independent decisions concerning cross examination and concerning lines of inquiry at the competency hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.453" offset="12013059">This is like the Geders v. United States case out of this Court which limited the access of the attorney to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.357" offset="12044719">In this case their limiting the access of the attorney to the defendant again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.892" offset="12058825">And they're making it, we submit, impractically difficult if not impossible for the counsel to do their job under that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.866" offset="12110757">As to the issue of harmless error, we submit that this type of violation should not be subject to a harmless error analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.257" offset="12156314">This represents a core confrontation violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.892" offset="12174809">This is not like Snyder v. Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.661" offset="12185885">It's not like other cases which don't involve live witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.029" offset="12199364">Snyder v. Massachusetts involved a jury view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.267" offset="12212321">This is live witnesses testifying before the trier of fact and it's an impractical if not impossible standard to be able to specifically show the prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.491" offset="12265193">But this Court has never held where a person has been excluded, where live testimony has been given, that they need to show precisely the prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.148" offset="12311795">The prejudice is clear in this case and it's even more clear when you consider the very marginal competency level of these witnesses that they later demonstrated at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.058" offset="12367488">It's just basically unfair in this case for the defendant to have been excluded from the competency hearing and then not accorded the opportunity for effective cross examination because the witnesses may very well have been incompetent when they testified in front of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.804" offset="12458499">Furthermore, as to the issue of harmless error, in Russia v. Spain, this Court held that the error was harmless, was subject to a harmless error analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.462" offset="12505101">But again, that did not concern the defendant being absent during the testimony of live witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.635" offset="12533836">That only concerned an ex parte communication between a judge and a juror regarding a fear the juror had as to one of the witnesses in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.859" offset="12590678">There are no cases, I submit, where this Court has held it's harmless error to exclude the defendant where live testimony is being given.</text>

            <text syncTime="3313.309" offset="13400474">I do not believe that by this Court holding that a defendant has the right to be present at the competency hearing that it would in any way weaken the ability of the states to prosecute child sex abuse cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3353.453" offset="13561075">Your Honor, one very brief clarification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.869" offset="13570688">In terms of the facts of the case being explored in a competency hearing, at page 86 of the Joint Appendix in the opinion in this case, Justice Stevenson chastises the Circuit Court for going into the facts of the case and we believe that message is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.180" offset="13635994">It will not be done in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.032" offset="13643413">Unless the Court has any further questions, we would ask the Court to reverse the Kentucky Supreme Court and hold that neither Stincer's right to be present under due process, nor confrontation was denied in this case.</text>
