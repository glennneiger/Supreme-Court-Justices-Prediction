            <text syncTime="62.673" offset="391646">This case concerns one particular form of mixed train-truck transportation, and whether the Interstate Commerce Commission could properly allocate this particular form of mixed service to the system of rail carrier regulation, rather than the system of motor carrier regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.154" offset="477537">Specifically, the transportation at issue in this case is TOFC service, trailer-on-flatcar or container-on-flatcar service, which involves a rail portion, during which the trailer or container rides on a railroad flatcar, and a motor portion, during which the trailer or container is pulled by motor vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.150" offset="561546">Even more specifically, this case concerns only one particular form of TOFC service, a category of what has long been called Plan II service, where the entire service is provided by an interstate rail carrier on equipment owned and operated by the rail carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.231" offset="637824">The ICC decided in this case that that particular form of Plan II service should be subjected to the system of rail carrier regulation, and not to the system of motor carrier regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="187.237" offset="889853">Well, it is true that the statute generally uses the term, transportation provided by a rail carrier in various places.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.974" offset="924857">And that it is not entirely consistent in its use of language.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.711" offset="943770">But the phrase, transportation provided by a rail carrier, under the literal definition of the word transportation, includes motor vehicle as well as rail movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.667" offset="983581">The Interstate Commerce Commission decided in this case that for the entire portion of TOFC service, both the motor and the truck portion, that the proper system of regulation for the entire service is the rail carrier provisions and not the motor carrier provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.468" offset="1078771">This case arose as a result of Congress' passage of the Staggers Act in 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.372" offset="1102386">That statute, which extended and furthered the deregulation policies first put into place in the mid-1970s, made major changes in the system of rail carrier regulation in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.846" offset="1152332">The general findings and policies set forth in the statute are important to this case, because the state expressly provides that individual provisions of the entire Interstate Commerce Act must be interpreted to further the declared national rail transportation policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.224" offset="1221817">The Staggers... in the Staggers Act, Congress expressly found that overregulation had contributed to the financial plight of the rail industry, and that much regulation was today unnecessary, largely because transportation had become much more competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.619" offset="1295378">It then went on to set out a new national rail transportation policy, which emphasized deregulation at the Federal level; maximum possible reliance on market forces in rail carriers providing transportation; uniformity between State and Federal regulation; and, in particular, the promotion of intermodal transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.318" offset="1390151">Congress went even one step further, and expressly amended the national transportation policy that applies to other modes of transportation, to give the rail policy express priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.026" offset="1437066">That policy must govern whenever a government action has an impact on rail carriers.</text>

            <text syncTime="334.834" offset="1480221">Yes, in the very first words of Section 10101, the general national transportation policy, says that the following shall govern except when policy has an impact on rail carriers, in which case the specific rail carrier policy will govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.776" offset="1548035">In its first act pursuant to the Staggers Act, new... the Staggers Act new exemption provision, the ICC determined, in this case, that both the truck and train portions of rail-provided TOFC service should be exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.507" offset="1626924">It took this action pursuant to two... to one of the two important provisions of the Staggers Act that is in issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.363" offset="1662346">The exemption provision that the Staggers Act added to the Interstate Commerce Act changed what had been the historical practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.086" offset="1713233">Historically, all rail carrier activities were subject to an extensive system of regulation, covering the rates charged and most other aspects of rail carrier activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.930" offset="1764642">In 1976, Congress took one step and granted the Commission power to exempt activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.584" offset="1795257">But there was a limit in that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.369" offset="1802363">Only activities of limited scope could be exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.488" offset="1818872">The ICC began considering whether TOFC service, fell within that exemption, and Congress specifically noted the potential availability of the exemption provision as written when it was considering the Staggers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.097" offset="1877282">But in the Staggers Act, Congress expanded the exemption power, and specifically directed the Commission to examine rail activities to determine when regulation was no longer necessary to protect shippers against an abuse of market power.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.875" offset="1944469">Congress also added to the exemption provision a specific section designed to promote the exemption of rail... of transportation provided by a rail carrier as part of intermodal service.</text>

            <text syncTime="514.532" offset="2199006">The pre-emption provision of the Staggers Act is the second important provision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.138" offset="2233488">And that provision worked an even more fundamental change in the system of rail carrier regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.542" offset="2255117">Historically, an interstate rail carrier was subjected to a dual system of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.046" offset="2277060">And intrastate shipment was initially subjected to State regulation, with appeal to the Interstate Commerce Commission, to simplify matters, only if the State action discriminated against or unduly burdened interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.973" offset="2340799">Congress radically altered the balance of Federal and government authority in the Staggers Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.394" offset="2366503">After the Staggers Act, a State was permitted to continue regulation intrastate transportation only if it did so in accordance with Federal standards and procedures, and it had obtained certification from the ICC to continue that regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.023" offset="2437034">In this case, Texas has been denied certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.742" offset="2459917">It was denied certification while the ICC decision that is at issue here was pending in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.431" offset="2490637">The precise chronology is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.466" offset="2502758">The ICC granted the exemption to TOFC service, both the motor and rail portions, in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.555" offset="2535150">That decision was affirmed by the Fifth Circuit in its American Trucking Association's case of 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.375" offset="2566392">In the early eighties Texas, like many States, had provisional authority to continue regulating.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.665" offset="2591574">And under that provisional authority, it determined that for intrastate shipments it retained the authority to regulate the motor portions of TOFC service.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.706" offset="2639744">The ICC disagreed with that decision by Texas, and that decision was in turn--</text>

            <text syncTime="659.010" offset="2776939">In this case, they said a different analysis is required when the service is purely intrastate.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.949" offset="2808704">And the Fifth Circuit determined that intrastate motor portions constituted transportation provided by a motor carrier, subject to the Motor Carrier Act, which expressly reserves such activity to State regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.744" offset="2879862">It is our position that the Fifth Circuit decision was wrong because it took too simplistic a view of the statutory scheme, and because it failed to give the ICC the deference it is due in making an allocation decision, a decision about where to allocate an inherently mixed form of transportation in a complex regulatory scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="731.641" offset="3067525">We showed in our brief that the language of the two or three particular provisions at issue in this case can bear the construction that the Commission gave it.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.116" offset="3117367">First of all, the motor vehicle portion of TOFC service in fact constitutes transportation provided by a rail carrier, because transportation is given a broad definition in the statute that encompasses not just rail but also motor vehicle movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.494" offset="3182882">Second, when a rail carrier provides motor vehicle transportation, as an adjunct to, incidental to, its rail transportation, it need not automatically become transformed into a motor carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.270" offset="3245994">Not all motor vehicle movement is by definition movement by a motor carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.574" offset="3271176">The particular provisions at issue here, of course, can't be read in isolation, as this Court... this Court's approach in its American Trucking Association's case of 1967, we think, took the proper approach.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael E. Roper</label>
            <text syncTime="1043.723" offset="4315865">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.616" offset="4371349">The issue before this Court is the narrow question of whether Congress delegated power to the ICC to exempt the motor portion of intrastate TOFC transportation provided by a rail carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.541" offset="4423071">There is no dispute that the ICC does have, and did properly exercise, the power to exempt both the motor and rail portion of transportation provided by a rail carrier, when that transportation was on a interstate basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.266" offset="4478033">Likewise, there is no dispute that the ICC could and did exempt the rail portion of intrastate TOFC-COFC transportation provided by a rail carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.407" offset="4518575">Railroad petitioners, all of whom are interstate rail carriers operating in Texas, concur in the analysis made by the government, and that will not be repeated here, hopefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.381" offset="4566431">Instead, my primary focus will be on what the practical effect of the decision below will be, if that decision is allowed to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.654" offset="4599555">Petitioning railroads will suffer real and tangible harm if the motor portion of intrastate TOFC transportation provided by a rail carrier, is subject to regulation by the Railroad Commission of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.228" offset="4649814">While it is true that petitioners are not presently engaged in a large amount of that type of transportation, one reason for that is the uncertainty created by the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.269" offset="4697984">Railroad petitioners view complete intrastate TOFC-COFC transportation as a necessary component of their ability to be fully effective competitors in the State of Texas and other large States where there is a potential for long-haul transportation by rail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.116" offset="4781367">The major effect of the decision below will be to prevent railroad petitioners from competing with intrastate motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.789" offset="4816057">Texas has essentially conceded in its brief that its aim is just that, to protect intrastate motor carriers from competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.895" offset="4852524">One wonders why Texas is so concerned about protecting an industry, when that industry apparently is not itself concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.750" offset="4883871">The Texas intrastate motor carriers have not appeared at any stage of this case before the ICC or the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.004" offset="4912919">We believe it is safe to assume that motor carriers would have contested this matter if they were truly fearful of this competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.260" offset="4945938">In any event, railroads will not be able to effectively compete because of the higher costs and less flexibility associated with transportation that is partially regulated and partially deregulated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1257.845" offset="5172263">But in any event, I don't think it's necessarily an either/or situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.082" offset="5201207">TOFC-COFC transportation involves the movement of usually two trailers or containers on one flatcar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.872" offset="5240391">Under the TOFC exemption adopted by the ICC, a portion of the movement must be over the rail in order for the rail carrier to be able to provide over-the-road motor vehicle service in its own trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.198" offset="5289710">Both interstate and intrastate TOFC-COFC shipments move on the same flatcars, in the same trains, and receive the same physical handling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.672" offset="5335581">However, if the decision below stands, the intrastate TOFC-COFC shipments will be subject to economic regulation by the RCT, Railroad Commission, while the interstate shipments will be exempt from economic regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.063" offset="5393155">The example discussed in railroad's opening brief is illustrative of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.384" offset="5414471">That example concerned a shipper making an intrastate shipment from Houston to Texarkana, Texas, and a shipper making a TOFC shipment from Houston to Texarkana, Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.192" offset="5461700">The rail carrier chosen by the first shipper would move the trailers over its tracks to Dallas, and then would have to obtain either a certificate to operate as a motor carrier to move the trailers to Texarkana, Texas, or would have to use another certificated motor carrier for that portion of the move.</text>

            <text syncTime="1368.916" offset="5616554">Well, I think it's illustrative of the problem you have with the dual regulatory system, that Congress has concluded was too much of a burden on the rail carrier industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.104" offset="5657305">And that's why they did what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.223" offset="5665768">It is interesting to note that Texas did not dispute the validity of this example, but rather stated that the disparity was condoned by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.781" offset="5716028">We believe that statement to be erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.499" offset="5726895">Because Congress, in adopting the Staggers Act, specifically found that separate State and Federal regulatory policies were to be eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.522" offset="5758973">Congress therefore preempted State regulation of intrastate rail transportation except to allow certified States to regulate in accordance with Federal standards and procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.813" offset="5808188">Texas, of course, because of its decertification, does not even have that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.466" offset="5826787">If the decision below stands, the policy of uniformity between Federal and State regulation will be frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.739" offset="5859911">That result would be contrary to the stated policy in 49 U.S.C. 10101a of assuring that intrastate regulation is consistent with Federal standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.428" offset="5902647">We also believe that the decision below conflicts with this Court's holding in the Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.784" offset="5932008">As this Court held, once the Congress has decided not to regulate in an area such as economic regulation, the States are not free to step in and regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.723" offset="5967848">Texas is attempting to do just that by asserting that the ICC does not have the power to exempt the full intrastate TOFC transportation provided by a rail carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.912" offset="6008599">The Staggers Act expressly adopted the policy to rely on market forces, rather than economic regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1542.877" offset="6312456">But it is our position that the statute that was adopted by Congress, where they said, transportation provided by a rail carrier, is exactly covering this type of transportation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.365" offset="6638359">For well over 50 years the Railroad Commission of Texas has regulated intrastate motor carriage, within the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.803" offset="6672110">That regulation has been active.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.255" offset="6681932">That regulation has been vigorous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.722" offset="6691858">But I submit to the Court that at the same time, that regulation has been even-handed, and has been entirely in keeping with the legislative mandate under which the Railroad Commission operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.896" offset="6732505">That legislative mandate was given to the Commission by the Texas legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.365" offset="6750373">In early 1984, the ICC, acting pursuant to what it considered to be its jurisdiction and authority, exempted from regulation the motor carrier portion of a totally intrastate TOFC shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.726" offset="6819858">I agree with Mr. Roper that the question in this case is simply this: Did the ICC have the jurisdiction under its statutes, under the sections in its statutes, to exempt the motor carrier portion of a purely intrastate TOFC shipment, or, as the State of Texas contends, is there a countervailing force to that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.925" offset="6916616">The State of Texas contends... Mr. Chief Justice, I think that was the question you were asking just a moment ago... that Section 10521b is an express limitation on the power of the ICC to regulate intrastate motor carriage.</text>

            <text syncTime="1959.531" offset="7979068">Number one, there is a specific statutory expression of power reserved to the States in 10521b, which says specifically, that nothing in this statute is meant to take away intrastate motor carriage regulation from the States; that's a paraphrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.124" offset="8045419">But more importantly, transportation as defined in Section 10102... I think it's section 25... does not mean what they say it means for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.698" offset="8099754">Number one, it's a recodification of the prior statutes in which the definition of transportation was different for motor carrier, water carrier, and freight forwarding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.072" offset="8141236">Number two, it's in the disjunction; it is not in the conjunctive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.107" offset="8157328">It talks about X, Y, Z, or a different type of transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.928" offset="8184599">Finally, Your Honor, transportation is defined broadly because it is used in the statute in many different contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.367" offset="8218350">Clearly to me, and to the State of Texas, it has... while it's defined broadly, it means different things in different contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.342" offset="8258265">And that's why it's much too simplistic to say that transportation provided by a rail carrier includes any other type of ancillary transportation such as motor carrier traffic, which a railroad might seek to provide.</text>

            <text syncTime="2942.682" offset="11911646">And Congress can clarify very easily by simply referencing in 10521b, one other section, perhaps 11501, where they could say that there's a specific... there's a specific power to exempt intrastate motor carriage when part of a TOFC movement.</text>
