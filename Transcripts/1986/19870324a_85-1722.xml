            <text syncTime="15.259" offset="210861">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.294" offset="222982">The issue presented here is the standard of review of a prison regulation which affects the ability of some prisoners to participate in a religious practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.149" offset="258404">The case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.351" offset="275227">The regulation at issue required prison inmates who are assigned to work outside during the day to remain outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.272" offset="302917">It prohibited returns to the institution for any reason, save for medical emergencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.326" offset="323083">The District Court upheld the regulation against Respondent's First Amendment challenge, finding that it was reasonably related to legitimate goals of security and rehabilitation, and that it was not an exaggerated response to those objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.502" offset="379821">A panel from the Court of Appeals decided the case under its St. Claire versus Cuyler standard, a reasonable relationship tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.754" offset="408765">A rehearing en banc was then granted, and the Court of Appeals modified its earlier test, holding that prison officials must prove their regulations are intended to serve and do serve security goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.047" offset="457979">And, further, they must prove that there is no reasonable method in existence to accommodate the inmates' religious practices without creating bona fide security problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.105" offset="494237">Petitioners submit that the proper analysis to be applied here is the analysis that was applied by this Court in Jones, Pell versus Procunier and Bell versus Wolfish; that is, a regulation must be reasonably related to a legitimate penalogical objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.448" offset="555573">Absent evidence that the response is an exaggerated one, the regulation will be upheld.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="107.451" offset="579606">Ms. Hodian, was the Third Circuit's new test in this case applicable just to free exercise of religion claims on behalf of the prisoners, or was it across the board; do you know?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="laurie_m_hodian" startTime="119.675" stopTime="249.894">
            <label>Ms. Laurie M. Hodian</label>
            <text syncTime="119.675" offset="628507">Of course, only a free exercise claim was raised here.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.377" offset="643344">It's unclear whether it would apply to other First Amendment claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.846" offset="661212">This Court has recognized the importance of deferring to the considered judgments that prison officials have to make on a daily basis in regards to questions of security.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.256" offset="710845">Prisons, of course, differ greatly from the outside world.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.958" offset="725578">There really is no counterpart to a prison in the outside world.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.159" offset="738430">They are closed, sub-societies, populated by people who have committed crimes against society and often these are very violent crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.015" offset="773852">Of course, they are involuntarily confined; and that, in and of itself, lends itself to great confrontation and tension between the inmates and staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.371" offset="807289">In this hostile, adversarial atmosphere prison officials are charged with maintaining security, maintaining an orderly operation; and to the extent possible prison officials have the obligation to attempt to rehabilitate inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.631" offset="864340">However, inmates are constantly making challenges to prison authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.416" offset="883462">The tensions between inmates and staff make for a very volatile atmosphere, and this atmosphere changes at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.771" offset="912823">Sometimes an institution is running very smoothly, and the superintendent may be able to make further privileges available to inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.044" offset="945947">Other times the superintendent will get a sense that there is a great amount of tension underlying the prison administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.733" offset="984712">The Court has said that prisoners' claims must be decided against this background.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.756" offset="1020761">They must be analyzed in terms of the needs and the problems that confront prison administrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.660" offset="1044376">In Jones, therefore, this Court held that the burden is not on prison officials to show affirmatively that the regulated activity would be detrimental to proper institutional goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.032" offset="1085963">Deference is to be extended to their opinions unless there is substantial evidence on the record to show that their response is exaggerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.704" offset="1116579">This same analysis has been applied... had been previously applied in Pell versus Procunier, and was subsequently applied in Bell versus Wolfish.</text>

            <text syncTime="312.382" offset="1399328">Let's say this was a question of diet rather than a question of attending an important religious service.</text>

            <text syncTime="357.828" offset="1581140">Your Honor, there may be some differences permitted within the reasonable relationship test, but it is very difficult for prison administrators to evaluate the claims of prisoners, in terms of how important it is to their religious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.588" offset="1640177">It puts the prison officials in a very difficult position of saying,</text>
            <text syncTime="375.789" offset="1652925">"Well, we think your religion... your religious practice is central and vital to your religious beliefs, whereas yours is not quite as important. "</text>
            <text syncTime="384.395" offset="1687406">That lends itself to additional confrontations to inmates, which the prison officials here testified they wanted to avoid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1060.437" offset="4391498">But we believe that St. Claire was based very much on Jones and took language directly from Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.876" offset="4429323">The problem with placing any more onerous burden on the prison officials is that it encourages inmates to couch their claims in First Amendment terms and to seek to fit within the particular exemptions that are being granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.421" offset="4499436">The findings of fact here, which were based on the testimony not only of the officials, but also of the prisoners were that many prisoners were claiming to be Muslim, so that they could avoid a day of the outside work program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.579" offset="4552099">The testimony was that the outside work program was not very easily accepted by the prisoners, and many of them sought to come within exemptions to the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.720" offset="4596716">We submit that prison officials should not be in a position of having to challenge the inmates' sincerity of their beliefs, that if an inmate comes forward and says,</text>

            <text syncTime="1126.229" offset="4654708">prison officials don't want to challenge that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.164" offset="4662440">And there's really nothing more that they can do, other than making a very minimal inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.366" offset="4679263">Once a prisoner says, "This is indeed my religion", there's not much that the prison officials can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.187" offset="4702564">And yet, undoubtedly, with a very onerous burden on the State, one which will be very difficult to meet, prisoners will be making additional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.793" offset="4736941">We noted in our reply brief that the Fifth Circuit recently noted the problem of proliferation of claims amongst inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.665" offset="4768497">But the facts here show that the prison officials made a very good faith attempt to accommodate the religious beliefs of inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.371" offset="4807263">These regulations were not adopted in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.204" offset="4818652">The program had started in April of '83.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.275" offset="4830877">As problems arose, the prison officials attempted to meet those problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.227" offset="4846655">What they found and what the District Court found was that each time the prison officials eliminated an excuse for the inmates to come in, they came up with a new excuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.516" offset="4883854">And finally, with these increasing problems, the prison officials, after they discussed it with all the professional staff, adopted this regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1277.375" offset="5259286">Let me outline how I think that the test would work in a typical case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.863" offset="5289274">The prisoner would have to come in and show, first of all, the the prison rule that was being challenged infringed on his free exercise of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.301" offset="5326995">It would then be up to the State to show that the regulation was reasonably related to a legitimate penalogical interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.824" offset="5357088">The prisoner would then have to show that the State was wrong, that there was substantial evidence showing that the rule was not reasonably related to a legitimate penalogical interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.334" offset="5415080">One way that he could do that is by showing that it was an exaggerated response.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.536" offset="5431903">And as Justice Scalia pointed out, one indicium of an exaggerated response is the presence of easy and obvious alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.058" offset="5470041">No one can fault the Respondents for wanting to attend their religious service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.247" offset="5494806">The prison officials have been handed a very difficult job by society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.449" offset="5511628">They are supposed to protect society from the prisoners and the prisoners from one another, while trying to rehabilitate them, all on meager budgets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.555" offset="5544020">I want to stress that when officials act out of security concerns, one of their principal objectives is to protect the lives and safety of other prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.677" offset="5580487">So the trade-off in this case wasn't just between Respondents' religious claims and the Petitioner's satisfaction of having a well-run program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.933" offset="5613506">The trade-off was between these two prisoners' religious claims and the safety of all the other prisoners, as well as the safety of guards and society as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.872" offset="5649241">You can also see in this case that the Respondents' return to the prison would disrupt the rehabilitation program of all the other prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.728" offset="5692709">Now, someone has to make this delicate trade-off between the desires and needs of the various prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.263" offset="5714861">In the federal system, this decision is especially ticklish, given the wide range of religions and the potential for proliferation of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.886" offset="5749343">Obviously, this is a very subjective decision, which can be done well only by those familiar with prisons and prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.892" offset="5781317">It is not a decision well suited to intensive review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.344" offset="5795214">This is why the right standard is to leave the prison rule alone when it is reasonably related to a legitimate penalogical interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.715" offset="5824680">To require that the rule be for a compelling state interest, and it be the least restrictive means for achieving it will inevitably mean that courts will not give prison officials the deference they are due.</text>

            <text syncTime="1829.053" offset="7466006">For almost 200 years religious services have been conducted in prisons for inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.825" offset="7493068">While incarceration necessarily places limitations upon the rights enjoyed by free citizens, it is equally true that inmates do not shed all basic constitutional rights by reason of confinement or conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.934" offset="7553568">Rather, they retain those rights not inconsistent with their status as prisoners or legitimate penalogical objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.155" offset="7586378">This Court has held that prisoners retain the right to practice their religion, and has reaffirmed that prisoners should be accorded all basic opportunities to the free exercise of their religion, as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1999.312" offset="8147070">The record shows that this service was held since 1979 at this prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.633" offset="8168281">The record shows that prior to March of 1984, all Muslim inmates were permitted to attend that service, both maximum security inmates as well as minimum or gang minimum security inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.107" offset="8218228">And the record shows that presently maximum security inmates, those inmates who potentially are the greatest risk to the institution, are allowed to attend that services.</text>

            <text syncTime="2066.873" offset="8417281">The central issue was the justification for the deprivation of these inmates' religious rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.627" offset="8448314">That's what needs to be focused on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.895" offset="8457405">The institution's policies may be rational, but nonetheless that fails to deal with whether, as the Third Circuit held, it is possible to both reasonably accommodate the inmates' commands of conscience and the institution's legitimate security concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.107" offset="8526263">Petitioners fail to focus on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.559" offset="8540056">The no-return policy was never applicable to the gang minimum inmates, because under the facts of this case, gang minimum inmates, prior to March of 1984, worked on an alternate work detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.402" offset="8595436">That work detail was inside the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.604" offset="8608183">They never had to go back into the institution to participate in the Jumu'ah service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.941" offset="8633575">Moreover, the minimum inmates, who are housed at the farm, which is a geographically separate and physically distinct facility, were able to go back to the service... were able to go back and attend the service without passing through the main receiving gates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.053" offset="8702015">So to focus on the no-return policy or to focus on standard 853 is like a magician hiding the ball.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.991" offset="8741721">That's not the issue before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.360" offset="8751230">The issue here really is whether it was possible to accommodate these inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.681" offset="8772546">The evidence shows the alternate work detail occurred without problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.335" offset="8795116">The institution, the witnesses during the hearing below indicated that Muslim inmates do not pose any greater security problems for the institution than any other inmates.</text>

            <text syncTime="3007.832" offset="12181108">Moreover, in either the St. Claire test or a rational relationship test, contrary... and with all due respect to what the Solicitor General argued here this morning... there is no requirement to reach readily available alternatives, because you may never get there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.961" offset="12253623">And this case, it seems to me, evidences that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.329" offset="12267103">The state has proposed the no-return policy as being rational.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.316" offset="12287060">It's a general prison policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.749" offset="12292807">And that policy may very well be rational.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.887" offset="12309317">And under the St. Claire test, the state's burden ends, and then the burden shifts to the inmates to demonstrate that it's exaggerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.343" offset="12351112">It very well may not be exaggerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.528" offset="12359890">But that doesn't deal with the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.063" offset="12370025">The issue is whether you can accommodate the fundamental constitutional guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.384" offset="12399282">And in a situation like this, where there is no connection with the inmates' religious rights and the institution's legitimate security concerns, you will fail to get to those alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.810" offset="12452990">And that, frankly, is the problem with the test as proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.047" offset="12473992">And that, it seems to me, is what the Third Circuit was concerned about; and that is the reason, and it was the appreciation of that fact, which led the Third Circuit to an approach which could more appropriately both accommodate the institution's security concerns as well as the inmates' religious rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.413" offset="12567406">The petitioners have discussed the problems with this test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.032" offset="12589872">And they go through a number of potential problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.583" offset="12600112">First, they claim that it will result in frivolous claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.220" offset="12622681">I submit that frivolous claims should be dealt with precisely like that; they should be dealt with as frivolous claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.945" offset="12661552">That should not be a vehicle to eviscerate fundamental constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.747" offset="12684748">Second, they argue that inmates will recast their claims as free exercise claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.669" offset="12712438">First of all, what is ignored here is, regardless of the test, there is a predicate which must be reached, whether we are talking about a rational relationship test or a mutual accommodation test or an arguably correct sincerely held test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.630" offset="12780357">And that predicate, which the burden is on the plaintiff, the plaintiff must prove that the rights are religiously based and sincerely held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.570" offset="12816092">And that is going to apply regardless of the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.438" offset="12831557">And that is an appropriate standard to contest the religious claims of inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.859" offset="12857261">Secondly, the free exercise clause, as it has existed, obviously, the standards of that have not resulted in a rash of efforts by individuals in a free society to recast their claims as free exercise claims.</text>

          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3193.570" stopTime="3245.285">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3193.570" offset="12924030">I think your opponent's point is that to the extent that the benefits that have to be given upon the assertion of a religious claims are increased, the incentive to assert false religious claims will be increased.</text>

            <text syncTime="3269.680" offset="13228513">Indeed, that was an effort this Court recognized in Sherbert and in other free exercise cases, that there is a possibility for fraud anytime you recognize constitutional guarantees, and anytime you recognize free exercise guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.474" offset="13295700">But I think... I have confidence that the courts are able to distinguish between those claims which are legitimate and those claims which are fraudulent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.913" offset="13333421">And I do not believe that the appropriate vehicle to do that is to deny basic constitutional guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.853" offset="13365186">There are other ways that that can be achieved without denying those very basic and essential rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.792" offset="13400921">And this should not be the vehicle that's used to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.660" offset="13416386">It seems to me that what is essential to look at here is the nature of the right that's being asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.432" offset="13447524">It's not a novel program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.265" offset="13454838">We're not seeking to implement a new initiative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.467" offset="13467690">What we are seeking to do is the continuation of a practice which has occurred without incident for five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.156" offset="13502381">Secondly, we are not seeking... we are not seeking to be treated differently than others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.727" offset="13528712">This institution already provides on Saturday and Sunday for adherents with religions on those days, the right to attend religious services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.118" offset="13570299">We're simply seeking to be treated equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.986" offset="13581689">And I might note that the institution claims a lot of... the problem of overcrowding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.407" offset="13607393">And there are a couple of points that I think need to be recognized regarding that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.294" offset="13631008">One, suddenly on weekends, when all of the inmates are confined to the institution, when there are virtually no outside work details, and where there are less guards available, the problems of overcrowding disappear when it comes to providing religious services for those whose Sabbath falls on a Saturday or Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.641" offset="13712301">So it seems to me we are in effect establishing a different standard for those whose religion falls on different days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.146" offset="13746365">Thirdly, overcrowding, in and of itself... I think it is extremely dangerous when we permit that to be the rationale to eviscerate basic constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.490" offset="13803730">This overcrowding was not an emergency procedure... emergency problem that suddenly arose in 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.394" offset="13831315">The governor's executive orders had been in existence in 1981, and effectively, what we're doing here, is because the state, for whatever reason, has failed to appropriate the needed funds to relieve the overcrowding situation, it's then able to bootstrap on that fact by denying these basic constitutional guarantees to these inmates.</text>
