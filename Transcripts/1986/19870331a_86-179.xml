            <text syncTime="57.003" offset="370135">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="59.955" offset="381942">This case involves the constitutionality of Congress' 1972 Amendment to Section 702 of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.727" offset="416946">It is an amendment which restored to religious employers a right that they had enjoyed for 175 years before there was a Title VII: the right to prefer their own members for their own employment without running afoul of Title VII's prohibition against employment discrimination based on religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.689" offset="488835">When originally enacted in 1964, Section 702 permitted religious preference hiring, but restricted it to the church's religious activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.212" offset="526974">The undisputed purpose of the 1972 amendment was to free the courts and the EEOC from entangling themselves in deciding which of a church's activities are and which are not sufficiently religious to qualify for the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.256" offset="595101">Section 702 has none of the traditional indicia of an establishment of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.077" offset="622373">It involves no endorsement, no subsidy, no preference for one sect over another.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.081" offset="646406">The statute simply does not promote religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.884" offset="661661">All that it does is to permit churches to promote religion in the same way that they have done for all but eight years of our national existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.241" offset="699069">There is nothing in the establishment clause that prohibits churches from promoting religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.727" offset="721011">Indeed, that is the very reason for their existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.012" offset="734177">And neither does the establishment clause prohibit government from permitting churches to promote religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.500" offset="764061">Neither the Appellees nor the District Court has ever really faced up to the nature of the problem that Congress faced, and the limited range of available solutions to Congress, given the other decisions that Congress made.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.128" offset="830621">Congress could have simply made Title VII applicable only to race, sex and national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.466" offset="859983">But once it decided to include religion as one of its criteria, it had to provide some kind of exemption from that criterion for religious employers, lest, in violation of the free exercise clause, they be prevented from hiring their own members for purely ecclesiastical positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.029" offset="934171">Once it is recognized then, as I gather it is by everyone in this courtroom, that the Constitution required Congress to pick some exemption, the only real issue is whether the Constitution precluded the choice that Congress made.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.305" offset="1003343">In other words, Congress having opted for an anti-employment discrimination package that is not quite as large as the one the Appellees would have chosen, is Congress constitutionally obligated to make it larger?</text>
            <text syncTime="228.881" offset="1057573">The answer to that question has to be no.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.350" offset="1071470">Surely the establishment clause is not violated every time government regulates churches to a lesser degree than it might have, or every time that it lifts a governmental burden that would otherwise be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.593" offset="1128417">That means that the real objection to this statute finds its roots not in constitutional law, but in public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.799" offset="1165302">It boils down to the fact that the Appellees wish that Congress had gone further and prohibited more than Congress chose to prohibit.</text>

            <text syncTime="282.966" offset="1273971">Now, what about the application of the statute to profit-making businesses of churches?</text>
            <text syncTime="291.872" offset="1309602">Do you think that there is a legitimate secular reason for the government to allow religious entities to operate profit-making businesses and be exempted from Title VII?</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="304.965" offset="1361952">I do, Justice O'Connor, for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.333" offset="1371460">I stress that it is not this case, as you indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.452" offset="1387865">The first reason that I give that answer is that as is stressed by most of the amicus briefs that have been filed in this case, the distinction between what is secular and what is sectarian is a very difficult one to draw.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.628" offset="1448574">And, indeed, that intrudes.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.514" offset="1460172">And that's why Congress drew the line where it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.782" offset="1473234">And as a consequence, we think that at any point along the employment spectrum, you're going to have some line-drawing problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.972" offset="1501968">Therefore, the best place to draw the line is the place where Congress drew it.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.959" offset="1525896">Moreover, this Court has said many times... beginning at least as early as Walz versus the Tax Commission... that Congress does have a certain degree of line-drawing capacity in this area; that there is a channel between what the establishment clause prohibits on the one hand and the free exercise requires on the other, and that within that channel Congress may safely legislate.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.739" offset="1617011">If that means anything at all, we think it gives Congress the right to draw the kind of distinction that it drew in this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="374.693" stopTime="380.613">
            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="374.693" offset="1640835">Well, I think it's a much more difficult choice, if applied to a profit-making business.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="380.613" stopTime="634.562">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="380.613" offset="1664554">There is no question; there is no question that it is a more difficult choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.751" offset="1677093">But two points: One, I think that at the end of the day you're going to be better off observing the dividing line that Congress drew and giving that deference that the Court has said since Walz that we give to Congress in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.360" offset="1739578">But, in any event, it does not apply to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.212" offset="1754938">So the only serious First Amendment issue in this case is presented not by what Congress did in 1972, but by the District Court's own test, which by its terms requires federal courts to decide what a church really believes and whether its practices are true to its beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.209" offset="1830902">The Court's opinion, for example, quotes the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine Covenants, a theological treatise entitled "Mormon Doctrine", and then draws its own conclusions as to what the church's tenets really are and whether there is an adequate fit between what the church believes and what it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.789" offset="1917211">We submit that the First Amendment reserves those kinds of issues: what are a church's beliefs, and are its practices the best way to achieve them to the churches themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.680" offset="1960783">But the Court need not reach that issue, because if the principle that has been so often stated that there is some room between the floor and the ceiling, between the free exercise and the establishment clause, then it must mean at a very minimum that Congress can constitutionally choose between two exemptions where those were its only options, where either one is going to have a differential effect on religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.212" offset="2062974">But the one that Congress chooses is the one that does not put the courts and the EEOC into the business of deciding what are religious beliefs and how they can best be achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.853" offset="2105501">Finally, the Appellees have never really faced up to the fact that this is not a religious benefit case.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.476" offset="2143954">This is not a case in which Congress, starting from ground zero, gave to religious organizations something that they would not have had absent any action by Congress at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.981" offset="2181988">It is a religious exemption case, and the religious exemption cases make very clear that the rule has to be different for those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.503" offset="2216051">The Appellees and the District Court's position is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.371" offset="2227545">It is that the statute is unconstitutional because its effect is to give religious employers something that non-religious employers do not enjoy and that it, therefore, fails the effects prong of Lemon.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.463" offset="2275924">But if that's the rule, then it's hard to see how any religious exemption can ever survive, because by their very definition, religious exemptions always affect religious groups and always affect them differently than other groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.540" offset="2336215">If that were enough to invalidate it, then Walz and Gillette would have to be overruled; Bob Jones would have been decided differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.878" offset="2369547">And in United States versus Lee, the Amish social security exemption case, Congress could not constitutionally have exempted the Amish from social security taxes, even if it had wanted to; and the exemption that it did give, which is an exemption that is still on the books to self-employed Amish, is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.376" offset="2451571">The analysis is really no different, if it is expressed in terms of the traditional Lemon test, because if you assume the applicability of Lemon, then the analysis is basically the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.950" offset="2501936">You look first to see whether there was a proper purpose, and the District Court held that there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.087" offset="2518445">But Lemon's second prong inquires into primary effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.705" offset="2536940">In an exemption case, in determining primaryness, you have to consider not just the effect if Congress had done... if Congress acted, but you have to make a comparison between the effect of Congress doing nothing and Congress doing what it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.001" offset="2606112">The Appellees' case could not survive a comparative analysis, as even they appear to concede on page 22 of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.607" offset="2636518">They have not attempted to make it, and under those circumstances, this statute clearly survives.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.844" offset="2665462">Mr. Chief Justice, unless the Court has questions, I'd like to reserve the rest of my time.</text>

            <label>Mr. William Bradford Reynolds</label>
            <text syncTime="643.234" offset="2714990">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="648.572" offset="2736411">This is, it seems to me, a case that brings to the Court a First Amendment religious clause challenge to legislative action in perhaps its cleanest and simplest form.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.363" offset="2779565">Congress has barred religious discrimination in employment decisions under Title VII, but in so doing it has elected in Section 702 to exempt from that prohibition religious organizations, associations, institutions and corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.705" offset="2844871">Rather than imposing certain obligations on employers in order to accommodate a particular religious view which was the case with the Connecticut statutes struck down in Thornton and Caldor, what Congress here has done is imposed no obligation on religious employers in the interest of religious accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.386" offset="2927627">In essence, it has adopted a hands-off policy with regard to religious-based employment decisions of religious organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.844" offset="2965452">As stated, and indeed the uniformly recognized purpose for leaving religious institutions alone, was Congress' desire to avoid governmental control over and entanglement with the affairs and activities of religious organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.738" offset="3037028">As the court below correctly found, this satisfies the secular purpose requirement of Walz and Gillette and the like cases of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.161" offset="3074749">Section 702 exemption removes the prospect of intrusive and likely constitutionally-offensive inquiry, investigation and probing by government into the religious or the secular nature of church-related activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.640" offset="3144652">On another level, the exemption eliminates the prospect of secular control over and entanglement with the church's ability to fulfill its religious mission.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.013" offset="3190105">There is thus no tension here between the religious accommodation requirement that's incorporated in the free exercise clause and the establishment clause's prohibition against state endorsement or advancement of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.690" offset="3248829">Rather, Congress' hands-off approach brings the values of both the free exercise clause and the establishment clause into perfect harmony.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.463" offset="3283937">The exemption from an intrusive government regulation furthers the free exercise interest by preserving the liberty of religious organizations to create and exert authority over self-defining religious communities, and for much the same reason, it furthers the establishment clause's interest in avoiding undue secular control and entanglement.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.559" offset="3376306">It cannot be, as Appellants argue, that disharmonization fails in First Amendment terms, because Congress' accommodation of religion is broader in this instance than might be required or compelled by the free exercise clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.540" offset="3448195">Any narrower exemption, whether defined along the lines suggested by the court below or in some other fashion, would of necessity bring into play the kind of line drawing on secular terms that would exacerbate the very tension between the two religious clauses that Congress effectively avoided in Section 702.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.286" offset="3535235">Indeed, it's precisely for this reason that this Court in Walz and other decisions has acknowledged that there is considerable room between the floor set by the free exercise clause and the ceiling that's erected by the establishment clause in which legislatures may chart their own course of benevolent neutrality.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.533" offset="3616215">That Congress safely navigated a neutral course in Section 702 is quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.020" offset="3642128">The exemption applies to all religions even handedly, not to a particular sect or to select religions.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.973" offset="3670027">It involves no endorsement of, financial support for, or active involvement in religious affairs by government.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.529" offset="3704195">In this regard, the wall between church and state has not been breached.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.183" offset="3722794">Religion is neither enhanced nor inhibited by the Section 702 exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.337" offset="3747454">Now, Appellees have argued that the statute effectively grants religious employers a benefit, that is, to discriminate on account of religion, which is unavailable to non-religious employers but this is the inevitable consequence of a hands-off policy by the Governemnt in First Amendment matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.750" offset="3829060">It allows religious institutions to advance their own religious mission on their own terms and through their own membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.523" offset="3868140">To the extent such autonomy is regarded as a beneficial effect of religious exemption, it is precisely the sort of benefit that is protected, not condemned, by the religious liberty interest in the Free Exercise clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.699" offset="3928848">Nor is there any reason to fault the exemption because it might well open the door to uneven treatment of employees, either as between or among various religions or as between religious organizations and those that are not religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.994" offset="3994050">Whatever the particular employment decisions and the religious reasons on which they are based are from one religion to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.731" offset="4024979">That is not State action that determines different individual treatment but unregulated private action by religious groups of the sort constitutionally protected by the Free Exercise clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.991" offset="4078060">Here, Congress acted to preserve the autonomy of religious institutions to manage their own affairs with respect to matters of religious employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.597" offset="4116512">In fashioning a broad exemption, Congress emphatically removed from the judicial agenda precisely this sort of intrusive secular probing of the operations, activities and beliefs of religious institutions that preoccupied the Court below.</text>

            <text syncTime="2745.577" offset="11124434">I'm saying that the reason we protect... the reason we give churches some degree of autonomy is because individuals fulfill their religious needs through groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.721" offset="11180962">Now, the church and the government try to get some mileage out of a couple of significant cases of this Court, beginning in the 19th Century opinion in Watson v. Jones and continuing through the Kedroff opinion, and most recently, through the Serbian Eastern Diocese opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.682" offset="11252851">I think it's very, very important to reflect upon what those cases mean, and what they were based on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.586" offset="11280437">The cases essentially hold that there is a degree of autonomy afforded to religious organizations in resolving internal disputes; and that civil courts won't interfere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.279" offset="11331219">There's a very important passage from Watson v. Jones that gets repeated in variably by the Court's later opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.916" offset="11361730">And I'd like to read it, because I think it focuses on the problem with 702.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.919" offset="11385762">In Watson, this Court wrote: The right to organize voluntary religious organizations to assist in the expression and dissemination of religious doctrine, and to create tribunals for controverted questions of faith within the association... and I'll skip some of it... is unquestioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.567" offset="11460368">All who unite themselves to such a body do so with an implied consent to this government, and are bound to submit by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.471" offset="11487954">Now the emphasis on religious voluntarism in that passage, and in all those cases, is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.975" offset="11513971">Because individuals voluntary join churches, we give churches some deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.813" offset="11541348">This statute makes Mayson join a church to keep his job, his secular job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.532" offset="11564231">It subverts the very notion of voluntariness which is fundamental... which is a fundamental peg of the reasons that we give churches some autonomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.340" offset="11603415">But you take that away, your churches are allowed to grow not because of the appeal of their dogma, as Justice Douglass put it, but because they can use economic muscle over employees in secular activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.631" offset="11656600">We have... we have fundamentally distorted First Amendment values.</text>

            <text syncTime="3062.769" offset="12393149">I think that the best answer... the best answer to that question of who is to draw the line at the margin is simply that you don't draw it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.760" offset="12449155">That was Congress' judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.445" offset="12455842">It was Congress' judgment after it had had eight years experience of Ceasar potentially having his hands on the things of God.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.718" offset="12492936">And then Congress simply said, let's draw it nice and clean.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.454" offset="12511954">I think Mr. Watkiss has effectively conceded that that's the best place to draw the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.990" offset="12530030">He's conceded that even though my clients do not assert Section 702 for their purely commercial activities, that there is difficult drawing the line there; and that if the courts' statements really mean anything, that there is some room between Scylla and Charybdis, then it has to mean that Congress can choose between the only two available exemptions to it, the 1964 and the 1972 version, particularly when you consider that all of the impacts that Mr. Watkiss was talking about would have been identical under the 1964 version, if you accept our view of the Desseret gym.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.887" offset="12713619">And that brings me to my next point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.373" offset="12723545">Assume that you disagree, and that there is to be some line... there is to be some line that's drawn, that there is some minimum threshold, in order to cross what Thomas v. the Unemployment Commission said, you have to get past a practice that is just bizarre, that is just purely not religious, this is... that has clearly been satisfied in this case, and there are no findings in the district court to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.192" offset="12842873">The district court did not make what we would call findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.144" offset="12854680">It drew conclusions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.794" offset="12861263">And what it said was, that there is nothing in the Mormon faith that requires employment discrimination; and there is nothing that requires exercise in a gym that... that practices discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.504" offset="12916120">But that takes entirely too narrow a view, and gets the courts far too deeply into what Mormonism is really all about, and the amount of leeway, administrative, implementing leeway that the church really has to have in order to carry out its objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.131" offset="12990621">Because the fact of the matter is that the court... the church has concluded that its purposes can be furthered by providing a place where physical health, which according to Mormon belief is intimately linked to spiritual health, can be pursued in an environment where church standards are understood, respected and maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.962" offset="13077975">It's further concluded that this can best be accomplished by people who understand those standards and are committed to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.384" offset="13103575">Other churches might reach different conclusions, but this is the conclusion that this church has made, and this is a conclusion that Congress vouchsafes to it.</text>
