            <text syncTime="53.718" offset="365487">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="61.455" offset="396416">--This case involves the proper interpretation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1341, the Federal Mail Fraud Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.810" offset="425882">The primary issue presented is whether it is fraud within the meaning of that statute for a political party leader to fail to disclose to state officials a potential conflict of interest in his handling of the state's patronage system.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.654" offset="481262">The Court of Appeals held that a conviction under this so-called intangible rights theory is proper and we urge this court to reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.724" offset="513549">The basic facts were as follows: The petitioners and the third individual, Howard Hunt, were politically active in the Democratic Party, in the state of Kentucky, during the 1970s.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.949" offset="554405">In part because of their hard work on behalf of Governor Carroll, who was elected in 1974, petitioner Gray was appointed to a cabinet position in 1976 and Mr. Hunt was named head of the Democratic Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.006" offset="610620">Hunt as the head of the Democratic Party was invested with substantial patronage powers by the governor, which is not an uncommon practice, I think, in any state.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.664" offset="649281">What may be somewhat less common is the decades long tradition in Kentucky that certain state insurance commissions are treated as part of the patronage system.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.337" offset="683972">Thus, the agent for the state in procuring insurance was asked to share commissions with other individuals holding insurance licenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="225.045" offset="1050836">I would say two things about that, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.329" offset="1059926">First, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.412" offset="1064210">No state law was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.764" offset="1069644">Two, even if state law had been violated there was no instruction to the jury asking the jury to find that state law had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.335" offset="1095975">So that it's not, you know, whether there was a violation of state law in this case is simply not relevant to what the jury decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.339" offset="1123978">As I was suggesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.724" offset="1129516">It was not uncommon for public officials, or the relatives of public officials themselves to receive shared commissions under the patronage scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.130" offset="1167133">The Insurance Commissioner himself testified that his son was receiving insurance commissions as a part of this practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.201" offset="1195449">He knew about it and never doubted that it was a lawful practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.272" offset="1211645">In this case the government has however, challenged Mr. Hunt's recommendation to the Insurance Commissioner to appoint the Wombwell Insurance Agency as the agent of the state for Worker's Compensation and his directions as to how to share those commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.697" offset="1269428">Because the government in its brief, in this Court on the merits, has for the first time suggested that this case is not really an intangible rights case, I think that it is terribly important that the court understand clearly, precisely how the case was submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.839" offset="1321987">The government has reproduced the relevant instructions in its brief at pages nine to ten and footnote eight.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.826" offset="1345915">In reading them as a whole, I submit, reveals quite clearly that the District Court told the jury, at the government's request that it could conclude that petitioners "devised such a scheme", describing the scheme in the indictment as read in relevant portion to the jury, if the jury found five facts basically.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.239" offset="1423551">One, that there was control over the naming of an insurance agency by Mr. Hunt.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.910" offset="1454271">Two, that Mr. Hunt had something to do with the selection of Wombwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.714" offset="1469422">Three, that he directed Wombwell to share those commissions in a particular way, four, that he held an ownership interest in Seton Investments.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.022" offset="1514666">And five, that he failed to disclose debt interest to the state government.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.474" offset="1536504">With respect to the petitioners then, they are charged solely with aiding and abetting that basic claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.977" offset="1558552">Our position is that however you analyze those facts as required to be found by the jury, there is no fraud in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.683" offset="1601288">And that the jury was clearly instructed that it could find on that theory as an alternative basis for holding that the Mail Fraud Statute has been violated and that the jury, and therefore the government must justify its extension of the Mail Fraud Statute to the situation involving Hunt.</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="380.211" offset="1671400">Well, Mr. Phillips, I thought the government is now telling us that the jury was instructed that for mail fraud, the government had to prove a scheme to defraud the citizens of their right to honest performance of public business and to obtain money or property by false pretenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1353.624" offset="5565108">The government agrees, I think, with one general proposition that is made by the petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.395" offset="5592171">And that's the point that there is a substantial amount of confusion concerning this intangible rights mail fraud theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.549" offset="5620801">And we would further agree that there is in some opinions of various courts of appeals, what I would describe as extravagant language, talking in terms of standards of moral uprightness, fundamental honesty, fair play and right dealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.642" offset="5689138">But that's, I think, where our agreement ends because first of all, in terms of this case, which is before this Court, that language I think is completely irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.818" offset="5741905">Also, as to the very cases in which that language appears, I think one is hard-pressed to find even one where the language itself is necessary to the holding of the case and indeed where the outcome, the decision and indeed the reasoning, if you read the opinion further, isn't well supported on a much sounder and narrower theory of the Mail Fraud Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.850" offset="5833960">But before we get to that question of intangible rights, I want to address the first proposition made in our brief, which is the point that this intangible rights theory need not and indeed I think, should not be addressed in order to resolve this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="3176.761" offset="12857660">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.861" offset="12862049">I would like to make simply three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.496" offset="12872602">I hate to drag you back into the jury instructions, but I think they're fairly important in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.450" offset="12892455">The first statement that Mr. Ayer made with respect to the instruction, I think, requires some clarification was his suggestion that Mr. Gray and his aiding and abetting must have been a public official, that the jury must have found that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.592" offset="12945014">Aside from the point that I believe Justice Stevens made, which is that there was no requirement in the jury instruction that that be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.511" offset="12968628">The truth is that at the closing argument, the United States attorneys, the Assistant U.S. Attorney told the jury that the aiding and abetting was in setting up Seton.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.386" offset="13008125">And it is undisputed that when Seton was set up by Mr. Gray he was not a public official.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.790" offset="13029755">So, it's both contrary to the instruction and contrary to the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.742" offset="13045533">Second, with the respect to the false pretenses, I guess I would just like to repeat what Justice Stevens said, this whole notion of a phony business and the various ways that that may have operated is an interesting theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.966" offset="13094434">It is not the theory that was presented to the jury in this case and I take that as the best evidence that the reference to false pretenses was not regarded as somehow a separate item in this case at all, either to the court, or to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.523" offset="13144694">And the court made it quite clear what it thought the appropriate theory for conviction was in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.261" offset="13163606">And that set out in the portion that describes the scheme underwritten in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.313" offset="13183877">And finally, with respect to the government's eleventh hour effort to find some limiting principles for its mail fraud, I took it as quite interesting that in describing that there must first be a duty, Mr. Ayer suggests that he wouldn't put primary emphasis on that point and it's quite clear to me why he wouldn't do that in this case because wherever you look there is simply no duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.245" offset="13271544">And I think ultimately what it came down to was that the duty that exists in this case is a federal duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.380" offset="13292129">But that's not what the Mail Fraud Statute requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.665" offset="13301219">This Court made quite clear in Parr that you look to other sources to determine what is fraud, and the fraud in this case is based on a duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.386" offset="13328178">You must look to those sources to find out where that duty exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.623" offset="13341134">There are none accordingly and the petitioner's conviction should be reversed.</text>
