            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="91791">The second case Western Airlines versus the Board of Equalization comes to the Court on appeal from the Supreme Court of South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.761" offset="138811">It involves the South Dakota Airline Flight Property Tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.978" offset="155634">The South Dakota tax is imposed on air carriers on the basis of the value of the aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.671" offset="186459">State law requires that the proceeds of the tax be allocated to the airports used by the carriers and to be used exclusively for airport purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.167" offset="228359">Appellants, four airline companies operating in South Dakota, paid their flight property taxes for the year and question under protest and unsuccessfully sought refunds in State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.155" offset="284366">Appellants argued that the taxation of flight property when most other personal property was exempt from taxation, violated the Federal Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982, which prohibits the imposition of discriminatory state or local taxes on air carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.595" offset="366077">The lawsuits were consolidated for review in the North Dakota Circuit Court and that court held that the South Dakota flight property tax was an in lieu tax which was fully utilized for airport and aeronautical purposes, and therefore exempt by federal law from the antidiscrimination provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.833" offset="455102">The South Dakota Supreme Court disagreed with the holding but affirmed on an alternative ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.798" offset="478926">In an opinion filed today for a unanimous Court we affirm the judgment of the South Dakota Supreme Court and hold that the South Dakota Air Flight Property Tax is an in lieu tax, which is wholly utilized for airport and aeronautical purposes within the meaning of the Federal Act, and therefore not in violation of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.208" offset="568578">Justice White has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
