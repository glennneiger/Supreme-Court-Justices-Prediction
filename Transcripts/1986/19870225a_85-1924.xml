            <label>Mr. Jerrold J. Ganzfried</label>
            <text syncTime="12.308" offset="183930">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.760" offset="193752">This case presents a question of statutory construction under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.962" offset="214545">The Board concluded that the respondent union violated Section 8(b)(1)(B) which prohibits a union from restraining or coercing an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.321" offset="275985">The Ninth Circuit denied enforcement to that order even though it acknowledged that the union's action may constitute prohibited conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.410" offset="308273">In our view, that recognition by the court should have ended the case and the Board's order should have been enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.599" offset="337007">Instead, in reliance on a theory that was entirely of its own creation, a theory that even the respondent now disavows, the court of appeals rejected the Board's interpretation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.941" offset="394477">It then compounded that error by rejecting the Board's findings of fact that would have required enforcement even under that court's legal theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.798" offset="429899">After briefly reviewing the facts, I will like to explain why the Board's interpretation of 8(b)(1)(B) is reasonable and should be upheld, and I would also like to explain why the various limitations on Section 8(b)(1)(B) advanced in the theories of the district court and by respondent should be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.562" offset="520909">This case arose out of a dispute between the respondent union and numerous electrical contractors in the Sacramento, California area involving the composition of a multi-employer bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.637" offset="581200">For some 40 years the respondent had a collective bargaining agreement with the Sacramento chapter of the National Electrical Contractors Association or NICA, as it is called, which is an organization that represented some 55 employers in the industry, in negotiating and administering collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.372" offset="680152">The last of those agreements expired on May 31st, 1981, and two weeks later the union struck all NICA members.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.459" offset="712544">The strike continued for some three months until September 15, 1981, when the union sent a disclaimer of interest in representing the employees of the Association's members in the multi-employer bargaining unit previously established.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.170" offset="775342">The union did not, however, disclaim interest in representing the employees of NICA members in a different bargaining unit or in single employer bargaining units.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.110" offset="815153">Rather, it filed separate petitions seeking to represent in single employer units the employees of some 17 NICA members, and as respondent's official testified in this case, the union's strategy was that,</text>
            <text syncTime="187.721" offset="885579">"Ultimately, down the road, it was our hope that everybody would be back under an agreement. "</text>
            <text syncTime="194.041" offset="910865">NICA, however, signed a bargaining agreement with a different union, the National Association of Independent Unions, or NAIU, and the two employers involved in this case, the Royal Electric Company and Harold E. Nutter, Incorporated, adopted that new agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.205" offset="987456">Some months later respondent restrained and coerced those two employers in the selection of their 8(b)(1)(B) representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.145" offset="1027267">Internal union charges were brought against union members employed as supervisors by Royal and Nutter.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.500" offset="1056628">Those charges were brought under provisions of the union constitution that subject a member to penalties for</text>
            <text syncTime="237.337" offset="1084005">"causing economic harm to other union members. "</text>
            <text syncTime="241.689" offset="1101455">and for</text>
            <text syncTime="242.891" offset="1106261">"working for an employer whose position is adverse or detrimental to the union. "</text>
            <text syncTime="249.645" offset="1133219">Two supervisors were found guilty of those charges and fined $6,000 and 28,200 respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.317" offset="1167910">The National Labor Relations Board found that the union's conduct coerced the disfavored employers in the selection of their representatives for Section 8(b)(1)(B) purposes, and therefore that the imposition of those fines constituted an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.529" offset="1240739">In reaching that conclusion, the Board applied the test that this Court set forth both in Florida Power and in ABC versus Writers Guild; namely, whether the union's action may adversely affect the employer in the selection of his representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.424" offset="1308344">Section 8(b)(1)(B) was designed to preserve an employer's unfettered right to select supervisory personnel for two specific functions: grievance adjustment and collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.683" offset="1373442">The section preserves that employer right by removing from the arsenal of labor unions a particular economic weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.891" offset="1414193">That weapon is the union's ability to restrain or coerce an employer in the selection of its representatives for the two stated functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.264" offset="1447734">Just as the statutory language focuses on the restraint an the employer, the Board and this Court have focused on the potential impact of union conduct on employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.738" offset="1505621">Specifically, in ABC versus Writers Guild, the Court described how such union discipline as we have here can restrain an employer's exercise of rights preserved under that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.961" offset="1562464">Such discipline, the Court said, may adversely affect a supervisor's willingness to perform grievance adjustment or collective bargaining duties, that is, his willingness to serve in that capacity in the first place, or the discipline may affect the manner in which the supervisor performs those tasks.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.690" offset="1833406">I might add that even with that proviso in mind, the union's right to enforce its own rules ends when the enforcement of those rules impairs a statutory labor policy, and here the enforcement of a rule impairs the statutory labor policy set forth in 8(b)(1)(B), namely the preservation of the employer's right to select his representatives.</text>

            <text syncTime="1824.038" offset="7430819">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.056" offset="7446911">In view at the questions thus far, I would like to begin my argument by emphasizing the nature of the union rule in this case, because it is at the heart of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.214" offset="7491528">This rule of the IBW, which goes back to its founding in 1891, prohibits members from working for employers who are adverse to its interest, in this case by paying wages and working conditions less than those negotiated by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.195" offset="7567492">The force of the rule, which was common in 1947 as we note in the brief and is common today is directed to and falls upon the union members, whatever their job classification may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.870" offset="7626111">It in essence requires their loyalty by not making themselves available to those employers who would undercut the conditions which the union has achieved, and in this case, I might add, it's clear that the rule long predated the employment, or probably even the existence of Messrs. Choate and Schoux.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.201" offset="7715450">I would like to respond at this point, Justice Scalia, to your question about the pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.272" offset="7739796">I disagree completely with Mr. Ganzfried in that, if this situation had come up as follows: Mr. Choate goes to his union office and says,</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.912" offset="7786294">"There's a job open for me at XYZ Electric, they are non-union but I need the acney, is there a problem if I go to work for them? "</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.518" offset="7816700">And the union agent says,</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.970" offset="7826522">"Absolutely. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.620" offset="7829135">"Look at these provisions in the constitution. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.703" offset="7837494">"If you take that job it will be a violation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.339" offset="7848047">"I personally will bring charges against you. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.207" offset="7855466">"The last supervisor who worked for a non-union employer was fined $5,000. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.128" offset="7883156">And Mr. Choate thinks about it and decides that he's not going to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.182" offset="7899352">I think it is simply inconceivable that that has restrained any employer in his rights under Section 8(b)(1)(B).</text>

            <text syncTime="1974.503" offset="8032681">This case is the other side, of course, of the hypothetical I have just mentioned, and we think the rule should be no different if, having deliberately breached the rule, he is then disciplined for that reach of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.429" offset="8092344">This Court, in fact in several cases which we have cited has noted that these rules are not only legitimate but serve a vital interest to the union, namely the elimination of wage competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.922" offset="8150336">I would point out that in ABC where the Court did uphold the Board's decision, it specifically referred to the Board's decision in that case as reaching, and I quote, 8(b)(1)(B) as established in Florida Power.</text>

            <text syncTime="2026.951" offset="8242496">Here, we think it is clear that the Board has gone beyond those boundaries in reaching out to this rule which does no more than limit the pool.</text>

            <text syncTime="2094.746" offset="8513647">At first glance it may seem that that's the situation we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.884" offset="8530157">We submit, however, that that statement was made in the context of an existing collective bargaining relationship because the Writers Guild did represent what has become known as the "Hyphenates" in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.976" offset="8590552">Therefore, there was a potential for an interference with an existing collective bargaining relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="2175.098" offset="8835058">But the short answer is, that situation just did not occur here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.300" offset="8851881">As far as the Administrative Law Judge went, was to say that the discipline imposed in November and December of 1982 was intended to force the breakup of a multi-employer unit, the old unit, back in September of 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.665" offset="8941324">But apart from illogic of that, we have another ally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.384" offset="8960237">We have another Board decision arising out of these precise facts and that is the Arden Electric case which is cited in our brief and which issued a year after this decision of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.044" offset="9014885">In that case, the Board found that NICA, and I quote, "agreed to the dissolution" of the multi-employer unit, and even more pointedly noted that the unit,</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.636" offset="9069219">"was dissolved by the parties' consent to the disclaimer. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.838" offset="9086042">in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.790" offset="9097850">As the Ninth Circuit pointed out, it simply seems inconceivable that fines against two individuals in November and December of 1982 could have been for the purpose of forcing the breakup of a unit in September 1981 which the parties had dissolved consensually.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.086" offset="9163051">One of the anomalies of this Board decision is that if it stands, a union could discipline rank and file members but not supervisor members for the same breach of the same union rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2410.316" offset="9775884">We have set forth in some detail in our brief the legislative history of 8(b)(1)(B), and the one thing that it shows clearly is that Congress, and particularly the principal sponsors, envisioned it as a narrow provision which was aimed at two specific evils; forcing an employer to get rid of a particular supervisor who was deemed objectionable to the union because of the way in which he had performed his managerial services, or forcing employers into or out of multi-employer units.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.306" offset="9915900">As I have mentioned, this rule does neither.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.925" offset="9930320">It simply seeks to prevent the erosion of the union's negotiated standards by requiring that its members not make themselves available to work for those employers who would undercut those standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.267" offset="9983714">All of the examples used in the legislative history clearly make sense only in the context of a collective bargaining relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.123" offset="10023107">As Mr. Taft said, we do not like Mr. "X" and you must get rid of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.960" offset="10042542">Senator Ellender said, so and so is too strict with the union; get rid of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.698" offset="10069500">It's virtually impossible that they believed that this section dealt with the situation we have here where there is no bargaining relationship whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.739" offset="10117670">In a different setting this Court seemed to accept the limited scope of 8(b)(1)(B) and that was in the 1981 case of Labor Board versus Amax Coal which dealt with the interplay between Section 8(b)(1)(B) and the duties of trustees under Section 302 Trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.354" offset="10208054">The Court's opinion there, which reflected the views of eight Justices, described Congress's intent under 8(b)(1)(B) as preventing unions from forcing employers to join multi-employer units or to dictate the identity of those who would represent employers,</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.851" offset="10290078">"et cetera, and we did not read Justice Stevens' dissent to take issue with that aspect of the majority opinion. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.838" offset="10317977">The Board's decision here clearly goes beyond Oakland Mailers on which ABC rests, and we think past the breaking point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.912" offset="10362281">It is important to recall that in Oakland Mailers the Board focused on the right of an employer to have "control over its representatives" and it noted with particularity, and I quote again,</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.191" offset="10427378">"The underlying question was the interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement between the parties. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.428" offset="10452351">There can't be any such question, and no issue of divided loyalties here because there is no collective bargaining relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.133" offset="10491221">Returning briefly to anomalies, another that we see here is that the Board's decision would grant supervisors a preferred status in unions because only they would be entitled to the benefits of membership without being held accountable for breaching the duties of union rules.</text>
