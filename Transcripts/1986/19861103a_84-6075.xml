            <text syncTime="1381.418" offset="5686300">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.745" offset="5699571">I believe this case raises three issues that stem from Enmund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.837" offset="5727992">The first, I believe, is whether Arizona courts adequately addressed the Enmund issue at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.286" offset="5761742">The second, I believe, is whether Enmund prohibits a death sentence for someone who did not do the actual act of killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.563" offset="5798836">And the third is, what should this Court do with a state court finding of fact that Enmund has been complied with, as there was such a finding here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.028" offset="5844707">I will address those three issues, in that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.150" offset="5865187">First, did Arizona adequately address the Enmund issue to begin with?</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.899" offset="5884204">And I believe that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.382" offset="5898101">A defendant's participation, relative to the participation of the others, has, since 1974, always been a concern in death penalty cases in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.408" offset="5942300">One of the statutory factors that may mitigate a sentence is a defendant's minor participation in the crime, again compared to other participants in the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.528" offset="5986709">Whether or not the defendant raises that point in the trial court, which is the sentencer in the State of Arizona, the sentencer must determine what the extent of the defendant's participation was; and if it was minor, according to the statute, that may... but it does not necessarily... mean that the sentence may be mitigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.708" offset="6071450">Now prior to about 1978, the consideration that was given to that particular factor, the minor participation, was rather perfunctory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.859" offset="6116067">That changed, however, with the Lockett opinion, and the questions it posed as to whether a death sentence could be imposed on one who had no intent to kill, which was the language in Lockett.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.526" offset="6170715">This case, I believe, is an example of that change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.617" offset="6187120">Here the trial court had before it the two statements of each of the petitioners, that each of them gave prior to their trials.</text>

            <text syncTime="1536.199" offset="6305402">--Well, Your Honor, all I can tell you is, he was the younger of the two, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.681" offset="6331316">He was the one who drove eventually the Lincoln off into the bushes at apparently the request of his father.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.458" offset="6366424">He was the one who also said that he believed that the boys were at the Mazda when the actual shootings took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.955" offset="6400488">Ricky, however, tells a different story.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.689" offset="6411355">Also, each petitioner... and the state, as a matter of fact... submitted written memos to the trial court, prior to the sentencing, arguing the aggravation and the mitigation, specifically addressing themselves to Lockett, and the question it raised of intent and limited participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.087" offset="6496932">The state, in those memos, argued that a death penalty could be imposed for murder felony; and the petitioners argued, among other things... they had a rather lengthy memo... that they had no intent to kill, and that under Lockett, their participation was so minor, their participation was so limited, that a death sentence would be disproportionate to their involvement in the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.016" offset="6588674">After a joint sentencing... and the sentencing was joint as to both petitioners here and also as to all the crimes committed; and that, by the way, involved actual live evidence other than the statements I've mentioned, concerning not only this case, but the other crimes that were committed... after that hearing, the trial court said that he disagreed with the petitioners' arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.208" offset="6693478">He said that their involvement was not minor; that they were active and equal participants right up to the moment of the shooting; and that they had to share equal blame with everyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.328" offset="6741961">Then that point, the extent of their participation, was specifically argued in briefs and argued orally to the Arizona Supreme Court by both petitioners on a direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.323" offset="6793892">And the Arizona Supreme Court, after its own independent review of the record which it does in every death penalty case in Arizona, the Arizona Supreme Court came to the same conclusion as the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.225" offset="6841540">The participation of each of the petitioners, they said, was not minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.082" offset="6864945">It was substantial, said the court, and the blame that they each had was equal to that of the actual killers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.016" offset="6900681">Then the Arizona Supreme Court, citing both Lockett and the Eighth Amendment, said, and I quote: We assent to the retributive principle of justice, which demands that persons be punished in proportion to their personal involvement in the crime, focussing the inquiry on the harm which may fairly be attributed to the participants' conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.381" offset="6998170">Now that ended the direct appeal on those murder convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.847" offset="7016038">A few years later, this Court announced its decision in Enmund v. Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.299" offset="7037771">And following that, both of these petitioners filed state petitions for post-conviction relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.422" offset="7066297">Again, along with other things, they both contended that Enmund precluded a death sentence in their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.436" offset="7094405">The state responded, and the trial court denied the petitions without oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.496" offset="7118647">Each petitioner then requested the Arizona Supreme Court to review that dismissal, and the Supreme Court ordered additional briefing, and specifically ordered briefing on the application of Enmund, and ordered briefing on the language in Enmund concerning lethal force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.940" offset="7192416">Oral argument was had in the Arizona Supreme Court on those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.235" offset="7213523">And the Supreme Court then delivered an opinion addressing Enmund and its application to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.295" offset="7241840">And the Supreme Court sustained each of the death sentences, holding that the facts were significantly different from Enmund... that's almost a quote from the Arizona Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.307" offset="7281860">And that the Arizona Supreme Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Tisons intended to kill, and that, they said, the dictates of Enmund were satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.536" offset="7330761">Now, from that decision of the Arizona Supreme Court, both Tisons petitioned this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.955" offset="7356465">Through all of this, the trial court, twice in the Arizona Supreme Court, two oral arguments in the Supreme Court, the emphasis was on the individual participation of each petitioner, and the individual culpability of each of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.714" offset="7431489">In each instance, the penalty was tailored to fit the individual blameworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.196" offset="7457402">Now, I do not believe that Enmund requires anything more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.117" offset="7477047">I believe the record will show you that the Arizona Supreme Court did adequately address the Enmund issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2230.999" offset="9084622">The first little side trip that was made was then made, I think the record indicates, of the trial testimony, about seven-tenths of a mile off of that highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.792" offset="9123806">From there, once the cars were stopped and the exchange of goods between the Lincoln and the Mazda was going on, another little drive of the Lincoln was taken, 50 or 75 yards away from that spot.</text>

            <text syncTime="2292.274" offset="9329755">Pointed it at him, and as another one came in the room, he pointed it at him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.178" offset="9345324">And I believe the statements by Ricky and Raymond would show you, throughout they were armed, whether it was with small guns or with shotguns at various times, we can't tell.</text>

            <text syncTime="2708.269" offset="10993651">Now, if this were a habeas corpus action, I would answer the last question by saying that you should accord the state court finding a presumption of correctness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.078" offset="11036909">That is what the habeas corpus statute says, and that is what this Court said, I believe, in Cabana v. Bullock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.122" offset="11061151">This is not a habeas corpus action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.527" offset="11070764">But for the purposes that we are now discussing, I really don't believe it makes any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.322" offset="11089886">Over and above the habeas corpus statute, this Court has said that it pays great deference to state court findings, factual findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.179" offset="11125308">The habeas corpus statute, I think, merely incorporates that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.287" offset="11141817">For the reason stated in Cabana, a state court finding should be accorded great weight, whether it makes its way to this Court by way of habeas corpus or some other method.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.641" offset="11179224">Therefore, the state court finding in this case, which was a finding of intent to kill according to the definition as stated on page 345, I believe it is, should be accorded great weight, and should not be overturned unless this Court can say that the finding is not fairly supported by the record, which is really also out of the habeas corpus statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.664" offset="11267309">And I do not believe that this Court can say that on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.146" offset="11285177">Throughout these proceedings, there has been little or no dispute that Raymond and Ricky Tison planned the escape; that they gathered the guns; they gathered the cars; and they gathered the ammunition to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.953" offset="11340452">To effect that escape, they used those guns as they needed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.264" offset="11361664">And they, with the others, kidnapped the Lyons family at gunpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.137" offset="11381203">They went through the belongings of the Lyons family, and they took what they needed to continue the escape, including the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.228" offset="11409520">And then, with the others, by using the guns they had gathered, they herded the Lyons into the Lincoln to be killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.553" offset="11446823">Now, all of these facts are in the various statements of both of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.068" offset="11464900">The only thing that has been disputed is what these two knew about the killings before they actually occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.176" offset="11489350">They say they were caught by surprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.879" offset="11496142">We believe that the state court is rather clear in its finding that they believe they were not caught by surprise; that they knew what was about to happen; they knew that Gary Tison was considering killing the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.921" offset="11544312">Raymond Tison said he knew his father was mulling that over in his mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.230" offset="11561553">And Ricky said he heard his father say that he was thinking about killing the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.729" offset="11575554">And after that, Ricky said, they stood back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.540" offset="11590810">They went back to the ground they had been occupying before, the ground from which they ushered the family into the Lincoln, and from there, Ricky says, they watched as the family was killed with a great many shotgun blasts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.488" offset="11650578">Ricky and Raymond Tison were as much a part of what happened as anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.048" offset="11676805">They, with the others, decided to kidnap and rob.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.952" offset="11696449">And they with the others kidnapped the Lyons family at gunpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.576" offset="11710973">They went through the belongings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.964" offset="11716511">They robbed at gunpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.558" offset="11722885">And then, once they had taken what they needed, they stood by as the accomplices did the actual killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.478" offset="11750575">Up until the shots were fired, the participation of one was the participation of all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.335" offset="11773980">In the plot to get away, each participated equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.270" offset="11793729">And each did his part to prepare for those killings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.284" offset="11813791">In the sense that the Model Penal Code uses the word "cause", the conduct of these two was a cause of the result because they contemplated the harm, and they contemplated that lethal force would be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.935" offset="11872410">They simply did not know that the Lyons would be the ones who were the result of that harm.</text>

            <text syncTime="3163.874" offset="12816162">First, there is a specific finding on page 336 that it was not essential to the defendants' continued evasion of arrest that these persons be murdered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.386" offset="12854196">Second, I must correct the record, because this Court has been badly misinformed about the status of Ricky Tison's statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.056" offset="12880841">We heard from the Attorney General that Ricky Tison consistently said he was not sent away to get water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.521" offset="12902679">I categorically dispute that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.317" offset="12913860">There is not a single statement in this record by Ricky in which he does not consistently say that the boys, all three of them, were sent away to get water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.783" offset="12947714">There is only a dispute as to whether they remained there at the time the shooting began, whether they were on the way back or at the scene of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.874" offset="12976135">In fact, Ricky's first statement when he was arrested at gunpoint at the shootout is... and here's the testimony at the trial... at this point Gary told the boys to go back and get the water--</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.136" offset="13013125">Everybody agrees with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.339" offset="13017931">At about the time they got back to the Mazda... the Mazda... they heard the shotguns go off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.306" offset="13045830">Due to the darkness, all they could see were flashes from the shotguns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.834" offset="13059936">There is a disagreement, we acknowledge that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.896" offset="13068191">The state concedes that it is essential to this case that they be present at the scene of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.644" offset="13091179">Why is presence essential?</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.127" offset="13097135">Generally, presence is essential because it is evidentially relevant to the intent of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.890" offset="13124198">Buy here we have presence if... at best, presence coming back... after any doubts had been resolved in their minds about whether the father would kill, when the father says, no, go get the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.684" offset="13171322">And in fact, if you look at the record of this case, you will see on page 21 that the young boy's statement, saying that I thought the father was struggling with this case, is followed by, that's what I think now about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.163" offset="13217298">In other words, at the time of the confession, it occurred to him that the father was struggling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.676" offset="13239345">There is a lot of chronological confusion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.362" offset="13250108">When the young boys' statements are read as such, they always come out saying, in effect, at the time we didn't know what was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.593" offset="13278947">Then they're in jail, or they're arrested, and they're asked about their state of mind, and they reconstruct their state of mind as of that point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.684" offset="13311339">The state categorizes the Enmund finding as a finding of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.199" offset="13325445">It is anything but a finding of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.448" offset="13334431">It is a construction of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.244" offset="13341641">It deserves no weight by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.914" offset="13352299">It is an attempt to reinterpret Enmund's intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.600" offset="13367032">Statements of fact have been found, and they were found in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.662" offset="13379257">For example... I hope I can do this briefly... during the second... the first appeal, one of the issues raised by the defendants was whether or not they were entitled to a second degree murder instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.175" offset="13413321">Under Arizona law, if there was any evidence to support second degree murder, they would be entitled to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.674" offset="13431293">The Arizona Supreme Court said they were not entitled to a second degree instruction, because there was no evidence of second degree murder; only evidence of felony murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.953" offset="13456475">Second degree murder would include foreseeability, recklessness, all of the things we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.998" offset="13476642">Yet the Arizona Supreme Court rejected an instruction on second degree murder, saying, therefore, that this was an all or nothing case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.837" offset="13507989">This was felony murder, that is, accidental murder carried out in the course of a felony, or it was not murder at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.288" offset="13533798">And if that's not the case, then they're entitled to a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.943" offset="13544351">Because in Arizona law, if there was any evidence of recklessness, of second degree murder, in this case, they would be entitled to a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.050" offset="13572772">The jury should not have had an all-or-nothing, if you don't find felony murder, you free them outright.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.876" offset="13592103">That should not have been the issue, and that was not the case under Arizona law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.984" offset="13608508">The Attorney General said that the penalty here was tailored to these particular individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.936" offset="13624390">Nothing could be further from the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.982" offset="13632540">The trial court's findings about these two young boys who never fired a shot were exactly the same, word for word, as its findings about Greenawalt who actually gunned down all the killers, and intended to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="3637.797" offset="14711815">The level of intent required for second degree murder in this case is clearly, everybody would acknowledge, less than what is required for Enmund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.842" offset="14743998">Second degree murder... no state punishes second degree murder by death.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.836" offset="14763956">The penalty... the level of intent required for second degree murder includes clearly things that are not specific intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.819" offset="14791855">That is our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.071" offset="14800945">The question in this case is whether or not they had a level of intent which comes within the Supreme Court's definition, in Enmund, of specific intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.037" offset="14836785">But we're arguing alternatively, there is not even a finding, nor could there be a finding on this record, because the finding is to the opposite effect, that even a level of foreseeability that is argued for by the state could not be met in this case.</text>
