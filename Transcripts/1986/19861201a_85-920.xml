            <text syncTime="57.170" offset="370824">Good afternoon, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="62.240" offset="391095">The issue here is would Congress have enacted the remaining provisions of the Section 43 Employment... Employee Protection Program in the broad language it did if it had known that the one-house legislative veto provision, exclusively applicable thereto, set forth in the same section, was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.456" offset="496002">First, the relevant facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.224" offset="507078">Having made new entry and additional air service possible by replacing economic regulation with competition, Congress recognized that the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 would expand airline employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.852" offset="573534">The CAB and now the Department of Transportation already have authority to impose labor protective provisions as a condition of government approved private transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.327" offset="623480">Nevertheless, late in the legislative process, Congress added Section 43 to provide a single integrated employee protection program.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.651" offset="672799">The House and Senate had each passed bills providing for government assistance, money paid by the government to airline employees who lost their job because of deregulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.144" offset="730687">The House bill, in the traditional form of employee protection, conditioned the exercise of authority under the Deregulation Act, for example merger authority, on certification by the Secretary of Labor of protective arrangements similar to those set forth in Section 5(2)(f) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.676" offset="816891">Benefits paid by the airline would be reimbursed by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.664" offset="840819">The Senate bill involved a completely new concept of employee protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.234" offset="863075">If an airline went bankrupt or had a 15 percent workforce reduction caused by deregulation, its employees would be entitled to Government financial assistance, and, solely to offset the Government's cost, the right of first hire by other pre-1978 certificated carriers; the same Section authorized the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations to effectuate the existence program and the duty-to-hire program.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.289" offset="1003300">All regulations were subject to one-house veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.609" offset="1020541">In reaching a compromise, the conference committee deferred several important basic policy decisions relating to benefit levels and eligibility for assistance in hiring preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.952" offset="1077906">Instead, it directed the Secretary of Labor to adopt, within six months of October 24, 1978... and that date appears in the statute, Your Honor... all regulations necessary to provide financial benefits and hiring preferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.712" offset="1144989">That delegation was subject to a unique set of procedural and time restraints that ensured Congress' active involvement in the program's development.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.870" offset="1189606">Congress reserved ultimate regulatory authority through the right of either House to exercise the legislative veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.791" offset="1221266">Section 43, nor anywhere else in the Deregulation Act, is there a severability clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.129" offset="1250628">In 1979, the Secretary of Labor proposed regulations to implement both the financial assistance and the hiring preference aspects of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.289" offset="1299320">Final regulations were submitted to Congress on January 19th, 1981, but withdrawn 14 days later, which is long before the 60 day legislative period that they were to lay before the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.847" offset="1357521">For several years thereafter, there were no regulations; there was no employment protection program.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.000" offset="1386151">Then on June 23rd, 1983, this Court held legislative veto provisions unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.254" offset="1415199">Only thereafter were the regulations promulgated.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.974" offset="1434007">And they attempt to effectuate only the hiring preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.045" offset="1454278">Fourteen covered airlines challenged the regulations--</text>

            <label>Mr. William T. Coleman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="498.674" offset="2136806">We disagree 100 percent, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.074" offset="2146419">When you read every page that the Government cites in this book here, you will find that what is being described is the employee protection program.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.116" offset="2202634">There is one program.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.234" offset="2215069">And that program consisted of both parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.472" offset="2240042">Another evidence of that fact, and the Government calls your attention to the Zorinsky amendment, where he said that he wanted to exclude the financial payment part, but he wanted to have the right to hire part.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.331" offset="2307438">They don't tell you that when you look at the amendment you will find that with respect to the right to hire part, he still had the veto provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.757" offset="2365220">And so we say, it goes to both.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.109" offset="2374624">Because when you read the statute, when you reread the statute, you will find that it's impossible to work out the program that's in the regulations without having the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.834" offset="2421436">When this was before Judge Gesell, he determined that the legislative veto provision of Section 483 was inextricably bound with the remainder of that Section, and that Congress would not have enacted the remainder of the Section 43 in its absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.497" offset="2508162">He therefore declared the entire Section 43 unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.865" offset="2525612">The Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.084" offset="2538464">The language and structure of Section 43, as it emerged from the conference, House conference, Senate conference, showed that the legislative veto was essential in the unique legislative-executive partnership established in Section 43 to develop a single integrated employment program for protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.301" offset="2639402">Respondents ignore the veto's importance in the structure of Section 43, relying mainly on the lack of a big floor debate, espousing the virtues of legislative vetoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.215" offset="2722993">But this Court has said, on many occasions, the statute itself is the most important aspect of Congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.356" offset="2775552">And as Dean Griswold said in that wonderful casebook he had on tax, don't think great thoughts about the Internal Revenue Code; read the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1013.901" offset="4197762">No, nobody... nobody... nobody said that, because, frankly, we had a legislative situation which has existed, that on the one hand, the unions wanted much more money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.694" offset="4264949">On the other hand, the airlines felt that the program should be limited only to the airline that was the cause of the loss, or at most, only in those instances where the Act caused the unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.209" offset="4346974">When this was before President Carter, and he finally submitted a program which had both parts, it never moved through the Congress, either way, because the unions thought there should be more money, and the airlines thought the coverage of the regulation was too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.347" offset="4483542">And so nothing happened until after the election, and one day before the change of administration, final regulations were published.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.827" offset="4557416">Fourteen days later they were withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.463" offset="4572045">Thereafter, the new administration published proposed regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.968" offset="4606004">The legislative veto is still in effect; I mean, at least you haven't declared it unconstitutional yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.907" offset="4641740">The new administration would not send those regulations up to the Hill for the 30-day legislative period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.096" offset="4678520">It was only after the Court declared the veto unconstitutional that the legislation... I mean, the regulations were sent up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.606" offset="4740587">And then, because one who wanted to change the situation either way, no longer had the effective power over the executive to bring about those changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.215" offset="4798997">Now, that's the reason why you... the majority of your in Chadha said that you can't have that separation of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.571" offset="4832433">I'm not going to stand here and agree whether you were right or wrong, because that's already been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.042" offset="4854272">But once you decide that, I just ask you that if there's been a legislative process, and on the tough issues both sides stood down and said, let's wait for the regulation and we will have this additional activity before they become effective, and then that is destroyed, can you in good conscience say that that's what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.042" offset="4966285">Now, this legislative veto is different from those in a lot of other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.180" offset="4986869">This is not a case where you have a broad, big statute, and you have a lot of different provisions for issuing regulations, and then someplace in the statute, there's a veto provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.606" offset="5048623">In fact, in the Deregulation Act, there are 25 regulatory delegations, but only one is subject to the one-house veto, and that's the one in Section 43, and it applies exclusively to the employee protection program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.571" offset="5136394">In fact the conference committee rejected the only other legislative veto provision from the Senate passed bill at the same time it was strengthening this particular provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.213" offset="5191042">Now, as I read the respondents' brief, they concede that the veto was an important Congressional constraint on the financial assistance part of the EPP.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.437" offset="5235869">But they then search the legislative history in vain to support their argument that the legislative veto was only essential to a check on the financial guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.228" offset="5283098">And that's where they point to Senator... or Zorinsky, and as I indicated, when he made the amendment, he kept the one-house veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.552" offset="5324371">But I'd like, more to the point, to take you to the language in the structure of Section 43.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.106" offset="5354569">There's nothing in there where Congress limits the veto to regulations implementing Section 43(a)(1), which is the financial assistance subsection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.748" offset="5397096">Section 43 expressly applies the elaborate legislative oversight provisions to all regulations issued pursuant to Section 43.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.305" offset="5443385">In fact, as I said, the Secretary here claims that any authority he has comes from Section 43(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.411" offset="5483823">When you look at the structure of Section 43, you realize that the Congress was talking about one program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.052" offset="5534396">If you have any doubt about that, look at Section 22 of the Senate bill, from which Section 43 emerged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.292" offset="5579327">In that bill, both the hiring preference and the financial payments were triggered by the same 15 percent reduction in workforce, or bankruptcy, and in both cases, there was a legislative veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.302" offset="5639408">Then look at Section 43 itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.158" offset="5674830">On page 38A, the title, Employee Protection Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.995" offset="5706177">And look at the definition section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.364" offset="5719656">And then look at the section which is on page 44A, which is (j), the termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.869" offset="5753616">And it says that "the provisions of this section"... and that's both the financial payments and the duty to hire...</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.145" offset="5806696">"terminate on th last day the Secretary if required to make. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2119.914" offset="8621756">One of those reasons is that courts have no power to invalidate statutes except the command of the Constitution or the State or inferred intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.238" offset="8667104">And the best evidence of what Congress wanted is what it wrote.</text>

            <text syncTime="2667.899" offset="10813743">I think it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.351" offset="10819594">Now, the regulations we are talking about are, in part, provided for in Section 43(d)(2), a separate subsection, which gives the Secretary of Labor some assignments, but it gives him, I suggest, no assignments that there's any reason to think Congress would not have given him if it had known it could not have a legislative veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.156" offset="10950729">It just doesn't delegate any responsibility that there's any reason to think Congress wouldn't have been willing to delegate unconditionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.976" offset="10982076">It directs the Secretary to maintain and publish lists of available jobs; it authorizes the Secretary to require carriers to provide the necessary information; it directs him to make every effort to assist an eligible protected employee in finding other employment; and then finally, subsection (f)(1) says that the Secretary may issue such rules as may be necessary for the administration of the section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.031" offset="11110285">And if we are to apply the test of whether it is evident, or indeed, whether there is any significant likelihood at all that Congress would have been unwilling to give the Secretary of Labor those assignments if it had known it could not have a legislative veto, the answer is that there is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.753" offset="11241211">Mr. Coleman implies that the statute leaves gaps to be filled in by regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.191" offset="11274961">His principal one is that there is some question, he says, whether an employee was meant to be protected if his unemployment is not demonstrably due to deregulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.586" offset="11340476">He made that argument to Judge Gesell who pointed out that there is nothing in the statute to support it, and rejected it as without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.961" offset="11390004">Now, while there's nothing in the Secretary's assignment in connection with the duty to hire that there's any reason to think that any Member of Congress might have wanted to veto, there is an evident reason for the legislative veto, and that is, that the committees did want to have a second look at the levels of assistance that were to be set by the Secretary under the now inoperative financial assistance program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.326" offset="11487493">That was the hot issue, and indeed, the only mention of the legislative veto in the committee reports, and one of the two mentions of it in the entire legislative history, appears in the Senate report where the Senate committee says, the amount of such payments would be determined by regulations promulgated by the Department of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.024" offset="11582265">These regulations will be subject to Congressional review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.011" offset="11606193">Petitioners response to this is that the duty to hire and the financial assistance were supposed to operate in tandem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.765" offset="11637227">But that is true only in the sense that the duty to hire was the primary remedy expected to reduce the financial burden on the Government from the fallback... from the Government's fallback remedy of financial assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.044" offset="11702324">The statute itself provided for financial assistance only until the recipient obtains other employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.249" offset="11735134">There isn't any reason to assume that someone who wanted to veto the financial assistance would have wanted to veto requiring an airline that was otherwise hiring to give first preference, on whatever conditions the airline prescribes, to displaced employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.259" offset="11799186">And the... there's nothing whatever to support petitioners' suggestion that the continuation of their duty to hire, notwithstanding the dormancy of the financial assistance program, is either unfair to them or contrary to the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.608" offset="11888629">Their argument that the Congress would not have enacted the duty to hire if it could not have a legislative veto is based on what the Court of Appeals called circumstantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.784" offset="11945263">They point out that this is the only section in the statute that contains a veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.771" offset="11973266">But the absence of a veto provision in other sections tells us nothing whatever about whether this veto is an important provision or an unimportant provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.977" offset="12014017">And in this particular case, the presence of the veto is explained by the financial assistance program, which is not before the Court; and the absence of the veto in other sections is explained by the fact that this is primarily a deregulatory statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.438" offset="12087891">Mr. Coleman says that there are 25 other regulatory provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.890" offset="12105759">He has only listed four of them in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.560" offset="12128433">And I think that we adequately demonstrate that each of the four was a minor and technical one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.483" offset="12164064">Petitioners argue that two other legislative oversight features... the six-month provision and the report and wait provision... show the special importance of this legislative veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.208" offset="12207010">But apart from the fact that these provisions, too, relate primarily to financial assistance... indeed, the six-month requirement for the promulgation of regulations is directly linked to that in the statute... both provisions make it less likely; both the six-month provision and the duty-to-hire provision make it less likely that Congress, if it had been told, you can't have a legislative veto, would have scrapped the duty-to-hire program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.445" offset="12335950">The six-month provision shows that Congress was sufficiently concerned about labor protection to want to be sure regulations were in place promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.666" offset="12364789">The report and wait provision gave Congress a valid method of oversight; that is, the Court observed in Chadha, made the veto even less important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.723" offset="12405018">Petitioners suggestion that the legislative veto was part of a deliberate trade at conference is, I have to say, a figment of their imagination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.477" offset="12436051">The statute itself, the conference report, and the postconference debate, contain no evidence that there was any bargaining that related in anyway to the veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.566" offset="12472414">Certainly there is no suggestion that the House, which had a bill providing more protection and much more discretion, which did not contain a legislative veto, demanded a legislative veto as the price of accepting the Senate bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.445" offset="12535944">In sum, if, as I think you should, you assume that even in the absence of a severability clause, which the Court told Congress would rarely make a difference, if you assume that even in the absence of a severability clause, the Court's job is to see whether there is evidence in the structure and history of the statute that Congress would not have enacted a particular provision if it had known it could not have another provision, the answer as to both the statutory duty under Section 43(d)(1), and the authorization to write regulations that were incidental that duty, would clearly, I think in this case, have been enacted in any event.</text>

            <text syncTime="3485.610" offset="14084587">I think it important because there is no way, as this statute is set up, for the Congress... for the Secretary to do an end run around the legislative veto as far as financial assistance is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="3533.757" offset="14277162">It seems to me that's the El Paso Railroad Case; that's Carter Coal Company; and all those cases.</text>
