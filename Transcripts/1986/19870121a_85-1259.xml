            <text syncTime="12.724" offset="192416">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.193" offset="206208">The constitutional issue for decision in this case this afternoon is whether a citizen of the United States who finds himself to be the defendant in a suit brought by the federal government in a federal court, that is a federal district court, under a federal statute, subjecting that citizen to a substantial civil penalty, whether that citizen is entitled to trial by jury under the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.112" offset="325953">The facts briefly stated in this case are that in July 1981, the federal government, the Department of Justice, filed suit in the United States District Court in Norfolk alleging that Mr. Tull had filled properties, had developed properties and in some cases had sold those properties, in some cases more than five years prior to filing this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.964" offset="437340">In all cases at least more than six months last property having been filled and partially sold in December, 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.904" offset="473075">The complaint in that case, while it did ask for a conclusionary injunctive relief, the primary thrust of that case was to impose substantial civil penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.128" offset="530022">Interestingly in this case, Mr. Tull, in 1976, in order to avoid just this result, upon the advice of his attorney had asked for a jurisdictional inspection to be made by the District Engineer who is charged with enforcement of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.172" offset="602120">This jurisdictional inspection was made in July of 1976 by no less than the District Engineer and eight key people of this department, including several department heads and two attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.479" offset="655410">And the attorney's specific job was to make jurisdictional determinations to determine whether or not permits were required.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.788" offset="696579">Mr. Tull proceeded with his activity after having been told that in only two locations were permits required.</text>

            <text syncTime="145.375" offset="723015">Mr. Nageotte, we granted certiorari only on the jury trial issue in this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard N. Nageotte</label>
            <text syncTime="150.595" offset="743808">Yes, Your Honor, I'm simply trying to briefly summarize the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.297" offset="762616">Mr. Tull demanded a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.916" offset="777140">That jury trial demand was denied on the, and the basis of the trial court's denial was that all issues in this case were equitable or in regards to opinions requested from the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.461" offset="847358">The case today falls squarely within the case of Curtis v. Loether, the only distinction being that in that case the issue, the legal relief was punitive damages and in this case it is civil penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.791" offset="928651">We would point out that the government suggests that this case involves disgorgement of profits as a form of equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.301" offset="982672">Say to the court that the complainant in this case made no mention of disgorgement of profits or profits in any regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.157" offset="1014123">In both counts one, two and three of the complaint filed in this case, the government asked for the imposition of civil penalties under that provision of the statute, 33 U.S.C. 1319(d).</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="234.166" offset="1078176">Mr. Nageotte, if the language of the statute had made clear that the so-called civil sanction was to be related to disgorgement of economic benefit for example, would you think the Seventh Amendment would then guarantee a right to trial by jury?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_n_nageotte" startTime="260.733" stopTime="285.865">
            <label>Mr. Richard N. Nageotte</label>
            <text syncTime="260.733" offset="1184442">That would really depend on the precise language used.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.452" offset="1199279">Of course, disgorgement, if properly disgorgement under the equitable principles of disgorgement could be an equitable remedy bestowed in this statute by Congress in any number of ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.230" offset="1270437">But whether or not it is in fact an equitable remedy, in other words what I'm saying is--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="285.865" offset="1284961">Well, you would concede that it could be an equitable remedy?</text>

            <text syncTime="290.353" offset="1302933">I don't like the term disgorgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.305" offset="1318711">I don't think that's particularly correct, but restitution is probably a more appropriate term.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.525" offset="1339609">Restitution has always been a form of equitable relief that is to put the parties into the same position that they would have been in but for the action.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="310.166" offset="1382136">Well, is it possible that we could interpret this statute as essentially one for that type of relief even though it's not express?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_n_nageotte" startTime="322.224" stopTime="405.461">
            <label>Mr. Richard N. Nageotte</label>
            <text syncTime="322.224" offset="1430411">Justice O'Connor, I don't believe that that could be done in this case for this very specific reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.663" offset="1464161">Justice Marshall, in his opinion in Curtis v. Loether, pointed it out and Chief Justice Rehnquist in his concurring opinion in Albemarle Paper pointed it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.238" offset="1518391">The distinction between an equitable remedy and the discretion of the equitable court is whether or not under the statute the imposition of relief is discretionary, irrespective of the act of the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.336" offset="1606789">And in this particular statute you don't have that.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.871" offset="1616925">I believe Justice, Chief Justice White's exact words were to the extent that discretion is replaced by words which follow as a matter of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.394" offset="1659034">If 33 U.S.C. 1319(d), which is the civil penalty provision of the Clean Water Act, it requires that on a finding of a violation of the statute that a civil penalty be imposed, so for that reason I say it's no longer, it's not discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.924" offset="1745134">Now, of course, if that whole wording was changed then perhaps, but that's--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="405.461" offset="1763315">Would you clarify one thing factually for me?</text>
            <text syncTime="409.763" offset="1780556">Was your client offered an opportunity to repair the damage or fill in the canal in lieu of a penalty?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_n_nageotte" startTime="422.423" stopTime="508.212">
            <label>Mr. Richard N. Nageotte</label>
            <text syncTime="422.423" offset="1831129">--Yes, Your Honor, he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.827" offset="1852758">But it really was not an option because as the trial court noted this ditch, which the court called a canal, had been filled in as much as five years before this suit was brought and the government watched this whole thing being filled in.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.740" offset="1936455">It stood, stayed back and did nothing, notwithstanding an affirmative obligation of the District Engineer to issue a cease and desist order.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.227" offset="1966339">But irrespective of that, Mr. Tull had already filled, developed and sold each and every one of those lots that that ditch went through.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.369" offset="2010956">And he had sold them to third parties; he could not get them back.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.654" offset="2024122">The court recognizes, the trial court recognizes that numerous points in the trial which we cite in our brief and in addition to that we came in after the trial and asked for an option to restore the ditch in a different location because he could not restore it in the original location.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.500" offset="2107505">So the, it's a very long answer to your question, but the answer is that if he still owned it, perhaps he could, but he couldn't in this case and so that restoration really didn't come into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.292" offset="2158600">It was a remedy that was moot at the time it was offered.</text>

            <text syncTime="587.814" offset="2492758">I'm just... do you have any case that says that, that a penalty must be imposed, that the court has no discretion not to impose a penalty in this case?</text>

            <text syncTime="597.419" offset="2531106">No, Your Honor, these are... this is simply from my experience in trying these cases at the district court level.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.907" offset="2553153">That's the position the government takes in argument to the trial court that there is no discretion, based on that language in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.215" offset="2602368">The, getting to, back if I could to this disgorgement of profits as equitable relief as raised by the government, first of all I would point out that in all three counts of the complaint the relief sought specifically by the government in each count was civil penalties under the civil penalty provision of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.263" offset="2702574">There were no other either specific statutory allegations or factual allegations which would lend themselves to a position of disgorgement of profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.821" offset="2752729">I went back through after reading that in the government's brief and looked at the closing argument of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.141" offset="2778016">With respect to Eel Creek the closing argument of the government was that there was one day of violation; they were entitled to a $10,000 fine equating a day of violation to a day of fill.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.865" offset="2824931">With regard to Mire Pond I, they said there was ten days of filling, they were entitled to a $100,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.869" offset="2852935">With respect to Ocean Breeze they said there was a hundred days of filling and for Ocean Breeze they were entitled to a $1,000,000 in civil penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.292" offset="2890656">I also checked their post trial brief and the post trial brief specifically said the United States seeks a mandatory injunction against the defendant for restoration, a permanent injunction against further filling on the island without first checking with the Army Corps of Engineers to determine whether the location is within the jurisdiction of the Corps and civil penalties for every day of violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.513" offset="3011550">There was never at any time throughout this case any suggestion that what the court sought was disgorgement of profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.619" offset="3047913">I'd also take issue to the government's position that the court in this case could of, that somehow the civil penalties were transformed into some type of equitable relief from legal relief and that this constituted, or was within equity's power to provide complete relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.388" offset="3163060">The... as I see it, the government's position on that is not founded by the case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.042" offset="3193676">It's clear from the cases of this court and the point the government seems to miss is that an item such as penalties, forfeitures, and punitive damages, and we submit that in this case civil penalties are most closely analogous to punitive damages, that in those situations equity never had jurisdiction in the first place and never could award that type of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.994" offset="3313421">So, when you talk about equity granting complete relief you're talking about things like perhaps in those cases where it takes, where it took, before merger at least, money of some fashion to make the parties whole and Porter v. Warner Holding Company made that clear in that case the restitution of rent money was all right but they said that the civil penalties were a wholly different matter--</text>

            <text syncTime="949.096" offset="3937852">And I think that distinction is important to bear in mind while we discuss Congress' intent, because you see unlike the statute, the Title VIII statute in Curtis v. Loether where the cause of action and all of the relief including the injunctive relief which was equitable and the legal relief in the form of compensatory and punitive damages were a part of the same section of the same statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.414" offset="4051119">In this case Congress went out of its way to break apart the legal and equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.352" offset="4078913">The equitable relief is provided in 33 U.S.C. 1319(b); criminal relief in 33 U.S.C. 1319(c); and legal relief in the form of civil penalties in 33 U.S.C. 1319(d).</text>

            <text syncTime="1288.632" offset="5296011">I certainly would ask that the Court consider the petitioner's brief in Curtis v. Loether against the government's brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.959" offset="5345330">They precisely mirror on all of the points that the government seeks, and as we point out this Court unanimously rejected those positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.683" offset="5392246">I would state that the, it's important to discuss for a moment this business of equitable relief whether it's incidental to, or part of the equitable clean up doctrine for just a moment for this reason, it's very important to trial lawyers and trial judges that we don't go back to the old rule which has since been discarded by Dairy Queen, Beacon Theatres and Ross v. Bernhard for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.706" offset="5544278">Under the requirements of notice pleading only in the federal court, when you have to decide somewhere along in the trial whether equitable relief is really incidental to the legal relief sought which is the main case, or the legal relief is merely incidental to the equitable relief as you go along through the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.059" offset="5661725">And on the other hand you have to make your jury trial demand with the first, at the beginning of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.564" offset="5691713">You have to do these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.016" offset="5701536">What's going to happen if we ever go back to that old rule, you're going to end up half way down the line in a trial and find out that based on the evidence that came in because there was notice pleading that you may have to go back and redo the whole thing and then afford a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.763" offset="5788576">It's better to leave it the way it is with Dairy Queen and Ross v. Bernhard to insure that that doesn't happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.286" offset="5818669">Simply have the civil penalties, or punitive damages or forfeitures be the legal relief which is split off from the equitable relief tried first as to issues of fact and the relief and then the court can provide whatever additional equitable relief might be necessary in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.782" offset="5908634">I'd like to point out that in this particular case it's clear that when you apply the three element test which Justice White set out in Ross v. Bernhard, it's clear that the civil penalties require a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.498" offset="6003511">Those three elements are: What was the pre-merger custom with reference to such questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.968" offset="6025349">Now as we point out there's no question here in this case that as to civil penalties the pre-merger custom would have been trial by a jury because equity courts simply, even though they had jurisdiction to award complete relief, never had jurisdiction to award penalties or punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.132" offset="6102045">Second, I'd also point out that in the case of Hepner v. United States, and I acknowledge to some extent the character of that, of those statements that of course, they were entitled to have a jury summoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.809" offset="6168709">I've seen it written as dictum, on the other hand that's pretty strong dictum when you cannot impose, or when you cannot get to the underlying question, which in those cases were whether or not a directed verdict could be granted, whether that would, whether that would violate the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.828" offset="6284798">In the government's brief, their own brief, their own brief in that case said that it is evident therefore that the distinction between civil action for penalties and technical criminal prosecution was an old distinction in common law, well-known at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, as we cite in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.324" offset="6362747">Penalty actions were well known at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.443" offset="6379256">Secondly, in their supplemental brief at Page 7 and 8 in Hepner the government said, we answered that such a suit is not a criminal prosecution, that the defendant is not entitled to a jury at all, except be it under the Seventh Amendment as to civil actions and then in such actions the court can direct a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.623" offset="6463998">Last, I'd simply point out that in this case the civil penalties are clearly, when you compare them, with punitive damages, clearly on all fours match punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.484" offset="6531393">Even in the EPA guidelines they say, and these are guidelines of June 3, 1977, and civil penalties bear similarities to punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.626" offset="6576011">They were imposed in this case as punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3300.969" offset="13345382">This requires a balancing of equities of considerations such as these which is equitable in nature and which is not unfettered in the discretion of the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.312" offset="13406718">But it still is in the district courts a proper exercise of discretion and the application of the penalties would be subject to proper appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.370" offset="13450917">That is what the court held in Albemarle Paper Company, that ordinarily the back pay remedy should be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.309" offset="13482682">It isn't up to a district court to decide without basis not to award the back pay remedy quoting from Chief Justice Marshall's opinion sitting on Circuit in the Aaron Burr case that when a matter is committed to the discretion of a court that means that it is committed not to its inclination but to its judgment and that judgment must be based on sound legal principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.078" offset="13605771">So there is some statutory guidance in the legislative history of the 1977 Amendments for the way the penalty provisions should be applied in the exercise of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.790" offset="13676615">But we had in this case something difficult to foresee in any guidelines... the need to put a cap on the remedy that was required because of the filling in of a waterway, of a navigable waterway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.334" offset="13750802">There are other possibilities there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.953" offset="13761251">As Counsel for the Petitioner mentioned there was a subsequent hearing in December of 1983, and this appears in Volume 21 of the Court of Appeals Appendix, in which petitioner asked instead to be allowed to re-route this canal through other areas where he still owned the land and the court said it couldn't hear that claim at that time because he did not substantiate his request with any scientific evidence and didn't have an expert witness with him who could substantiate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.363" offset="13930943">But that possibility remains open for possible modification of the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.284" offset="13954662">The basic purpose of the remedy, as in administration of the statute in general, was to try to protect these wetlands which are on the eastern flyways and the ecosystem of these wetlands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.263" offset="14038567">And the penalty is very much ancillary and adjunct to this and used to assure there will be an incentive to comply and to bring about the purposes of the Act, which are to protect the waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.844" offset="14120905">We think that the proper historical analog, when the Act is understood this way is to the common nuisance or public nuisance cases that are well-recognized in opinions of this court, such as Justice Frankfurter's concurring opinion in the steel workers and in the English Common Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.613" offset="14235949">We have discussed it in some detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.748" offset="14248487">The petitioner's reply brief takes issue with our reading of one of the English cases and I would like to refer briefly to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.806" offset="14296657">On page 4 of the Reply Brief, in Footnote one there is a quotation from the English case which we pointed to as particularly close to ours in which petitioner contends that the case turns on the fact that the Crown claimed ownership of all tidal lands including harbor lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.392" offset="14415044">As we read the case, we don't think that's what it turns on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.396" offset="14439077">The italicized sentence in this excerpt is where the question is of nuisance only and the evidence doubtful there may be a need for a jury which probably referred to the advisory jury that was used by the Chancery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.126" offset="14521937">But this is not a case where the question is of nuisance only.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.280" offset="14538551">This is a case, as it goes on to say of purpresture and nuisance, purpresture being a form of common or public nuisance where there is an obstruction of a common waterway, so the detriments of many people and not just a nuisance to the particular land owner.</text>
