            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="147382">You may proceed whenever you're ready, Mr. Young.</text>

          <turn speaker="d_michael_young" startTime="57.753" stopTime="544.266">
            <label>Mr. D. Michael Young</label>
            <text syncTime="57.753" offset="378304">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="60.539" offset="389485">These appeals come to the Court from two decisions of the State Supreme Court of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.275" offset="412473">They involve 72 Appellants, all of whom have paid certain taxes to the state of Washington and are trying to get them back because they believe that the Washington tax statutes are unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.666" offset="462001">71 of the taxpayers were consolidated in the state courts in a case styled National Can Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.022" offset="495438">These 71 Appellants challenge the Washington taxes as violating the commerce clause on two independent bases: one, that they discriminate against interstate commerce; and two, that they're not fairly apportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.900" offset="566909">Either one of these defects would be a sufficient basis to invalidate the taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.637" offset="597838">I'll address the discrimination problem, and if by any chance my limited time permits I'll also touch on the apportionment problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.445" offset="641096">Having granted divided argument, Tyler's counsel will address the issues that are peculiar to that case, which include two commerce clause issues similar to those raised by the National Can Appellants and several other issues that aren't involved in the National Can appeal at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.990" offset="711313">The guts or perhaps I should say heart of this case are the taxpayers' activities, the way the Washington taxes are imposed on those activities, and the constitutional problems that they create.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.499" offset="769305">A very graphic picture of the hard facts are provided in the chart that was prepared by the state of Washington, the Appellee here.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.439" offset="809116">And to make the most efficient use of the limited time, I'm going to ask the Court's indulgence in referring with me to the chart that the state prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.580" offset="853629">You'll find it in the jurisdictional statement submitted by National Can Corporation, and in particular it's appendix K to the jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.720" offset="898246">So that's on the very last page of the National Can jurisdictional statement, appendix K.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.724" offset="926249">Now, I want to emphasize, this was prepared by the state and not by us.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.362" offset="948819">It was prepared in a context very much like the one that we're in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.699" offset="970135">As you may know, the state participated as an amicus in the Armco versus Hardesty case that was before the Court a couple of years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.305" offset="1008587">The state of Washington was trying to help the state of West Virginia defend its taxes, much like these here, against a challenge of unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.743" offset="1046308">But this Court held, after listening to the arguments that the states raised, that the West Virginia taxes were unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.266" offset="1080371">And so then the Department of Revenue of Washington had the task of coming back and explaining to the executives of the state and the legislature of the state why this Court reached that conclusion with respect to West Virginia's taxes and why Washington's taxes had the same kinds of problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.596" offset="1161664">Now, the state in this chart put itself, put the state of Washington, at the top in the large rectangle at the top, and it put the state of West Virginia at the bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.286" offset="1200430">I would like to start in the other order because I think it makes sense to start with your decision in the Armco case.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.772" offset="1226448">Okay, how does it depict the taxpayers here?</text>
            <text syncTime="272.741" offset="1238255">All of the taxpayers in National Can's appeal, like Armco, are manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.295" offset="1260512">They're producing something.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.413" offset="1268975">Almost all of them are manufacturing, a few of them are doing some extracting.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.615" offset="1285798">The second thing is that they, like Armco, are selling across state lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.519" offset="1309413">Now, in each case we're talking about a manufacturer selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.923" offset="1335013">In this chart the state has chosen to illustrate each activity by one of these small boxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.577" offset="1357687">So you can see Armco down at the very bottom of the West Virginia chart, manufacturing and wholesaling.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.432" offset="1393109">And they're connected with an arrow to indicate that both boxes go together, they're one taxpayer doing these two different activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.336" offset="1424665">Now, you'll notice running down the center of that chart is kind of a dashed line.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.073" offset="1439607">That represents the boundary of the state of West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.525" offset="1453400">And in Armco's case there, looking at the very bottom set of boxes, you can see that the manufacturing was going on out of state, the wholesaling was going on in West Virginia, and that arrow is crossing the state line.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.785" offset="1518497">This Court looked at the fact that Armco was paying West Virginia's wholesaling tax and it compared that situation with a like company doing business entirely within West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.175" offset="1568025">And that like company in the state's chart here is the top set of boxes in the West Virginia part of the chart there.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.615" offset="1597805">You can see that both the manufacturing and wholesaling was going on in West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.583" offset="1613687">No state boundary is crossed.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.869" offset="1622778">The important thing you can see there is that box for wholesaling, if you're an in-state taxpayer, is not cross-hatched, and the fact that it's not cross-hatched, according to the state's symbolism, means it doesn't get taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.945" offset="1679098">So the Court looked at a tax on the interstate company wholesaling, no tax on the local company wholesaling, and concluded that there was facial discrimination there.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.519" offset="1729358">I'd like to move now to the top of the chart, because that's what really tells us about Washington's taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.006" offset="1751405">Up there you'll see a striking similarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.208" offset="1768123">That shouldn't be very surprising.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.810" offset="1778572">In Washington's amicus brief to the Court in Armco, the state representated that its taxes were very similar to those of West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.535" offset="1817442">You'll see at the very top pair of boxes there local commerce in Washington; again two activities, the same company is manufacturing and it's selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.592" offset="1865717">But again, only one of those two activities is taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.877" offset="1882853">The only difference, really, between the top of the chart and the bottom of the chart is that Washington has reversed its exemption, so in Washington it's the selling that gets taxed, the manufacturing is exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.304" offset="1936561">In West Virginia it was the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.637" offset="1945860">Now, I'd invite the Court to compare the situation for that local company with our taxpayers who are before you today.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.112" offset="1983790">About a third of those taxpayers are like Kalama Chemical Company, and it's represented by the middle set of boxes there.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.849" offset="2010749">It's manufacturing in Washington, it ships what it manufactures across state lines and sells it in other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.704" offset="2046171">As you can see, Washington imposes on that interstate company the manufacturing tax because it has chosen, instead of refraining from interstate commerce, to sell across state lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.964" offset="2103222">Another group of our clients are represented by the bottom set of boxes there.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.833" offset="2122657">They're in a situation like Xerox Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.737" offset="2138226">They do their manufacturing in some other state, ship the goods across state lines into Washington, and sell them there.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.276" offset="2172394">Now, when we looked at the local company, when that local company... when any company manufactures in Washington, it incurs a liability for the tax on manufacturing.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.232" offset="2224221">But if it refrains from engaging in interstate commerce, if it will sell the goods in Washington and pay that Washington tax on the selling activity, that company will get a significant tax benefit, an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.029" offset="2299454">It gets a forgiveness of the liability it had already incurred for doing the manufacturing in the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="688.657" offset="2901942">Let me try to explain my dilemma a different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.395" offset="2916884">If we look at these as two separate taxes, a tax on manufacturing and a tax on wholesaling, then the tax on the wholesale activity considered as a separate activity entirely doesn't appear to either discriminate against or burden interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.772" offset="2994415">It is simply imposed whenever something is sold in the state of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.776" offset="3018448">The one on manufacturing, however, if you look at that as a separate activity and a separate tax, applies to manufacturers who export, in effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="953.293" offset="3960528">The state of Washington is using the same set of facts to impose a tax both on Tyler Pipe, who is before the Court, and on its independent representative, Ashe &amp; Jones, who is not before the Court, and I want to show you how.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.571" offset="4025625">Tyler Pipe manufactures pipe in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.273" offset="4036388">It ships pipe throughout the United States, to all the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.758" offset="4054360">It advertises nationally and uses regional shows to do the advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.145" offset="4079960">It sells through the use of catalogues.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.597" offset="4089678">Catalogues are distributed to all its customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.533" offset="4101485">Its customers are plumbing suppliers.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.918" offset="4114964">That's like a lumber yard except it's for the plumbing business instead of the lumber business.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.972" offset="4135235">In the state of Washington, Tyler has an independent representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.625" offset="4161880">All of the orders that Tyler Pipe receives and that are processed in the state of Texas come either from its plumbing supply customers... 45 percent of them come directly from the customers... or through Ashe &amp; Jones, the manufacturer's representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.254" offset="4232306">55 percent of them come through Ashe &amp; Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.122" offset="4243800">Ashe &amp; Jones has no inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.008" offset="4255398">It simply has employees who represent out of state manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.811" offset="4274624">Tyler Pipe is one of six or seven such out of state manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.881" offset="4298866">Ashe &amp; Jones has three and a half employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.099" offset="4311718">That's what the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.868" offset="4318824">Tyler Pipe's share would be about a half of a person, except that Ashe &amp; Jones also represents Tyler Pipe in Idaho, Montana, the western provinces of Canada, and Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.093" offset="4367725">So as a practical matter, Ashe &amp; Jones has less than a half a person available to represent Tyler Pipe in the state of Washington.</text>

            <text syncTime="1120.667" offset="4629994">Now, it just doesn't tax them; it taxes them under the same statute, the B&amp;O tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.154" offset="4651937">The state of Washington makes a distinction between independent contractors like Ashe &amp; Jones and employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.343" offset="4680672">The state of Washington is using the same set of facts to establish nexus for Ashe &amp; Jones to tax the commissions it receives on the Tyler Pipe sales in Washington as it uses to establish nexus for Tyler Pipe in the state of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.805" offset="4750575">Indeed, the state of Washington concedes that, absent the Ashe &amp; Jones activities there would be no Tyler Pipe nexus in the state of Washington.</text>

            <text syncTime="1163.529" offset="4801462">Substantially all of the activities that are incurred... a large percentage, more than half of the activities that are incurred in the wholesaling activities of Tyler Pipe that are being taxed by the state of Washington occur outside of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.789" offset="4870530">I have listed on pages 2 to 4 of the reply brief the activities that occur, and only two, one and only part of the second, occur in Washington, and most of the others occur in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.464" offset="4921207">Yet, the state of Washington would tax the wholesaling activities of Tyler Pipe 100 percent, without any apportionment for the activities, commercial activities that take place out of the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="1388.507" offset="5701328">I want to begin by discussing the issues common to both National Can and Tyler Pipe, discrimination and apportionment, and then I will turn to the issue of nexus, which concerns Tyler Pipe alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.581" offset="5749602">With regard to discrimination, the commerce clause provides that a state cannot provide through its taxes a direct commercial advantage to local business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.370" offset="5788786">On the other hand, the commerce clause does not prohibit a state from encouraging intrastate commerce, for competing for interstate commerce, so long as it does not discriminatorily tax the products or services of other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.596" offset="5841762">And the key is, how do you tell discrimination from fair encouragement?</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.715" offset="5858167">This Court, beginning in Boston Stock Exchange, laid down a bright line test to distinguish discrimination from fair encouragement, and that test is simply this: A tax discriminates if it affects the direction of commerce, either by erecting a barrier against interstate commerce or by telling an interstate business that's already present in the state that it can reduce its level of taxes in the state if it increases its business activity in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.365" offset="5964747">On the other hand, a tax does not discriminate if it treats intrastate commerce and local business equally, allowing for tax neutral decisionmaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.173" offset="6008006">And the Boston Stock Exchange case, Westinghouse, Maryland v. Louisiana that came after it, all adhere to this principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.511" offset="6037367">And Justice Scalia, with regard to your question, I think Boston Stock Exchange is really a key point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.398" offset="6056907">My opponent Mr. Young said that the pre-1968 case was not before the Court, which is of course true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.718" offset="6086164">On the other hand, the Court went out of its way to contrast the two tax systems: one discriminatory, the later system; and the other, neutral system, as being not discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.692" offset="6134125">And we think that that's highly significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.811" offset="6142589">In addressing the rest of my remarks on discrimination, I want to just briefly talk about the tax system and then in turn discuss the selling tax and the manufacturing tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.119" offset="6187833">Washington imposes its tax on the privilege of selling in Washington and on the privilege of manufacturing in Washington, and the rate and measure of these taxes are essentially identical.</text>

            <text syncTime="1633.648" offset="6681965">That system would fail our bright line test, and if any of the taxpayers here were doing business in that way we would lose.</text>

            <text syncTime="2268.186" offset="9220126">And I think the Court was correct in deciding not to address that question until a taxpayer came in who had actually paid that second tax, because one of two things would happen if you don't wait: A, you'll say you need to extend the benefit, but the taxpayer wouldn't receive any benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.267" offset="9296404">For example, these taxpayers don't pay the manufacturing tax or a selling tax to another state, so essentially it would be doing a useless act.</text>

            <label>Mr. William B. Collins</label>
            <text syncTime="2587.928" offset="10499082">Well, if you manufacture something in the state of Washington and then it goes outside the state, partially manufactured, the tax is imposed on the value of that product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.968" offset="10543176">If it's completed within the state, it's imposed on the value of that product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.956" offset="10559163">And the problem in the Fibreboard case was that... our court ruled that when it came back in the state, the multiple activities exemption didn't operate because the product was not the product so sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.614" offset="10617782">For apportionment purposes, though, this Court ruled that if you've got the... if the incidence of the tax is local and the measure is reasonable, that the tax is fairly apportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.725" offset="10678282">In Standard Pressed Steel, the Court ruled that the tax at issue in this case was apportioned exactly to the activities taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.712" offset="10702210">And in American Manufacturing versus St. Louis, the Court reached the same conclusion with regard to a manufacturing tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.032" offset="10727496">Now, the taxpayers have argued in their brief and alluded to here that our tax must be malapportioned because we consider the taxes together for compensating tax purposes, but we separate them for purposes of our apportionment analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.459" offset="10785175">And I submit to you that those are two different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.792" offset="10794474">For example, sales and use taxes are considered together to be compensating taxes, but for apportionment purposes there's never been any suggestion from this Court or any other court that I'm aware of that has said a retail sales tax must be apportioned on the basis of three factors or any other number of factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.372" offset="10868766">The point is those decisions of this Court sustaining the manufacturing and selling taxes fairly apportioned are correct, and the taxpayer in this case has done nothing to advance the burden of showing that the taxes aren't correctly apportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.732" offset="10930206">The only thing they've done is said, well, there's a possibility of overlap with some other tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.351" offset="10948701">And in the Court's decisions in Moorman, Container, and even Armco, the possibility of some overlap does not render a tax malapportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.457" offset="10981198">Let me turn briefly to the nexus question raised by Tyler Pipe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.511" offset="11001364">Tyler Pipe basically argued... National Can agrees that there is enough nexus under the due process and commerce clause to impose our tax upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.401" offset="11048907">Tyler Pipe contests the nexus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.936" offset="11059042">Now, Tyler Pipe sells products in Washington through the use of independent contractors who act as their sales representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.590" offset="11089658">And there's really two questions: Do the activities of the sales representatives give rise to nexus without regard to what their status' is?</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.065" offset="11127588">And the second question is: If those representatives do enough to give rise to nexus, does it make any difference that they're independent contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.652" offset="11161965">The lower court found that the activities were enough, and this Court has ruled in decisions such as Scripto versus Carson that the contractual tagging of a sales representative doesn't have any constitutional significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.478" offset="11221211">Now, counsel's argument with regard to nexus really broke down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.565" offset="11241586">He said: Our local sales representatives pay a tax and Tyler Pipe pays a tax, and that somehow means that we can't tax both of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.190" offset="11288084">And I want to sort out any confusion in your mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.725" offset="11298220">Ashe &amp; Jones pays tax under the service classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.479" offset="11317237">They're providing a service business of representing Tyler Pipe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.914" offset="11335000">Tyler Pipe pays tax on its activity of making sales in the state of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.234" offset="11360286">The fact that both Ashe &amp; Jones and Tyler Pipe pay tax is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.405" offset="11380975">Clearly, this Court would not have a rule that said that we could not impose this tax because of the independent contractor nexus and yet, if we went back to our state and repealed the tax on the independent contractors, that suddenly there would be enough nexus to tax them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.934" offset="11447118">The purpose of the nexus requirement is to get a connection between the taxpayer and the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.421" offset="11473031">The trial court in this case found that the activities of the representatives were significantly associated with the taxpayer's ability to establish and maintain the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.376" offset="11508871">The taxpayer does three kinds of things: first, they solicit sales: secondly, they gather virtually all of the market information from Washington state that's used by Tyler Pipe: and finally, they engage in various market maintenance kinds of activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.940" offset="11595075">For example, they make secondary calls on architects and engineers trying to get them to specify Tyler Pipe products in their engineering specifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.581" offset="11641678">They're available to help when there are shortages of shipments or there is breakage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.151" offset="11663934">They're the first line evaluators of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.186" offset="11672084">They perform significant activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.722" offset="11682220">Now, I don't think there's really any dispute, perhaps a bit of quibbling, about the fact that these activities are performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.792" offset="11706461">What Tyler Pipe argues is: We do a lot of stuff in Texas, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.078" offset="11723598">But that's not what's relevant for nexus, the fact that they do some activities in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.517" offset="11753377">What's relevant is the activities that they do in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.386" offset="11768842">And the trial court found, and it is supported by substantial evidence, that they engage in these three kinds of activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.373" offset="11796845">Under your decision in Northwest Portland Cement, simply solicitation would be enough to impose the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.960" offset="11823176">Under the decision in Standard Pressed Steel, the market maintenance activities and the information gathering activities would be sufficient to support the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.882" offset="11858807">In this case we have both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.251" offset="11868316">No question that the activities of these representatives give rise to nexus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.005" offset="11891304">And as I said before, there's no constitutional significance to the fact that they are independent contractors as opposed to employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.177" offset="11928084">They penetrate the market in exactly the same way, and what the Court needs to focus on are the activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.415" offset="11952953">I think that's the learning of the Scripto case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.450" offset="11965178">There's one last point I want to make before I take my seat, and that is to rule in favor of the taxpayers in this case it'll be necessary for this Court to overrule some of its prior decisions, in our judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.411" offset="12024946">And if the Court does that, we would urge it to make its decision prospective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.613" offset="12041769">In that case, the state would meet the three criteria for prospective application in a civil case set out in the Chevron Oil decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.652" offset="12081893">And of course, this matter is very significant to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.040" offset="12099447">1980 through 1984, the state estimates that it's worth about $423 million, which is about ten percent of our annual budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.412" offset="12132989">And of course, three additional years have gone by since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.180" offset="12148035">However, we hope it will not be necessary to reach a prospective application issue, because the taxes in this case are constitutional under the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.286" offset="12188473">Manufacturing and selling taxes pass the bright line test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.107" offset="12203728">Everybody pays the selling tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.642" offset="12213864">The manufacturing tax is a valid compensating tax because it meets the criteria of equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.213" offset="12240195">In-state and out of state taxpayers are treated in the same fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.367" offset="12260780">The tax is fairly apportioned under your decisions and there is sufficient nexus to impose the tax on Tyler Pipe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.937" offset="12287111">Accordingly, we would request that this Court affirm the Washington Supreme Court in both causes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3047.575" offset="12337580">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, you asked about the activities... or whether the Tyler Pipe was taxed on its gross receipts, and I said no and that is correct, they are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.319" offset="12396616">However, we had viewed and do view the law of this Court that we do not have to establish that the tax is in fact paid in another state, and I refer to the Adams Manufacturing case and then specifically the Gwin, White case, which involved the state of Washington tax, where this Court said unlawfulness of the burden depends upon its nature, measured in terms of its capacity to obstruct interstate commerce and not on the contingency that some other state may first have subjected the commerce to a like burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.075" offset="12531617">And that was an apportionment case in which this Court held that the tax on Gwin, White, who would have been equivalent to Ashe &amp; Jones in our case, was not permissible on sales going outside the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.467" offset="12593162">Now, counsel... I thought it was clear, but now I think it may be confused, as to what I was trying to do about showing you that the same activities were used for nexus for two different taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.677" offset="12658050">We're using the actions of Ashe &amp; Jones, or at least the state of Washington is, to find nexus for Ashe &amp; Jones and to find nexus for Tyler Pipe.</text>

            <text syncTime="3203.027" offset="12959398">Well, but why should nexus law be any different than agency law in this respect, when you're trying to see whether your company had a presence within the state?</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.033" offset="12991477">You can certainly have a presence within the state through agents, can't you?</text>

            <text syncTime="3215.485" offset="13009240">Yes, yes, you can have presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.954" offset="13015196">We are not suggesting that an independent contractor establishes some kind of wall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.489" offset="13033273">Yes, I do not say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.758" offset="13038393">But you should not be able to count them twice, that's all I'm saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.209" offset="13052185">And this Court has never before done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.744" offset="13062321">Counsel also says that... lines up two or three items that counsel says Tyler Pipe... Ashe &amp; Jones did for Tyler Pipe in the state of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.219" offset="13112162">I refer you to pages 2 to 4 of Tyler Pipe's reply brief, where I have listed the activities that were done by the state of... by Ashe &amp; Jones in Washington and the activities that occurred outside the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.079" offset="13171617">That list is there for two or three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.181" offset="13184051">One, to show that what Ashe &amp; Jones is doing is nothing more than selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.502" offset="13205367">They can call it selling or marketing or whatever else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.620" offset="13217802">They are solicitors, they are sellers, and that's all they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.505" offset="13233371">They can use all the facts they want to describe that, but it still comes out selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.059" offset="13251552">I could probably spend ten minutes this afternoon telling you how I shaved this morning and with all the details, but it's still just shaving.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.979" offset="13283212">And that's all that Ashe &amp; Jones was doing, selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.598" offset="13293766">We operated, Tyler Pipe operated, through catalogues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.617" offset="13305782">It was a catalogue operation in the state of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.252" offset="13316335">The list is also there because I think it demonstrates that the tax is improperly apportioned as to the wholesaling activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.793" offset="13358549">Most of these activities were outside the state and therefore... and the state of Washington taxes the sales in Washington 100 percent, without giving any credit for activities outside the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.386" offset="13416855">In the Standard Pressed Steel case, the Court was very careful to point out that all of the activities occurred within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.592" offset="13457710">It is also there to demonstrate that... well, that isn't demonstrated, but in addition the fact that the state of Washington provides no services to Tyler Pipe is indicative of the fact that Tyler Pipe has no nexus in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.453" offset="13525106">Now, I did say as to Tyler Pipe that Tyler Pipe did not pay a tax on its gross receipts outside the state of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.511" offset="13577351">71 other taxpayers before you, I believe it is stipulated that they did do manufacturing outside the state or they were taxed on gross receipts or other activities outside the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.537" offset="13633462">I think that's a stipulated record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.254" offset="13640358">One reason the records may be a little different is that we, that Tyler Pipe tried its case before the Armco case and the 71 other cases were stipulated following the Armco decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.312" offset="13696574">Tyler Pipe believes that it does not have nexus, not only because of the double counting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.083" offset="13727712">That's just one incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.800" offset="13734504">There are many other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.952" offset="13739101">There's your case of Norton.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.171" offset="13747983">The Norton case is right on point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.387" offset="13756864">In Norton, Norton had a manufacturing facility in the state of Massachusetts near Worcester.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.475" offset="13781211">It was selling into the state of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.893" offset="13790928">Norton had a store, an actual store with inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.581" offset="13805661">The customers came to the store and bought inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.133" offset="13823842">If some of the items were not there, the customer would then order them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.687" offset="13846099">Some of the customers ordered directly from the manufacturer in Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.674" offset="13870027">The Court held that all shipments directly from the state of Massachusetts to the customer in Indiana were not subject to the gross receipts tax in Indiana because there was no nexus as to those sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.700" offset="13930109">All of Tyler Pipe products were shipped directly from Tyler Pipe to the customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.587" offset="13953723">Ashe &amp; Jones never saw a piece of pipe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.289" offset="13964486">They were loaded on an interstate commerce, interstate truck in Tyler, Texas, and were shipped at the risk of the buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.847" offset="14006700">Therefore, the Tyler Pipe has no connection with the state except for its solicitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.216" offset="14028224">I don't think this Court has found or held to date that solicitation alone does justify establishing nexus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.373" offset="14068871">If it has held that, then there is very little left to nexus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.241" offset="14084335">But I do not think there are any cases that hold that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.859" offset="14106801">As far as the 71 other cases are concerned, in those cases there was either manufacturing in the state and wholesaling outside or manufacturing outside the state and wholesaling within.</text>
