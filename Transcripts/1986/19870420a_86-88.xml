            <text syncTime="10.247" offset="195359">Mr. Lee, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="12.496" stopTime="176.616">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="12.496" offset="204345">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.041" offset="218556">This case involves the competing claims of creditors to proceeds of an insolvent debtor's collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.256" offset="255336">The question presented is whether Congress when it enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 intended not only to prevent employers from paying unconscionably low wages, but also to repeal otherwise applicable state and federal laws governing the lien priorities of wage earners vis a vis other creditors where the employer becomes insolvent and therefore fails to meet his payroll just before he goes out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.276" offset="371424">The legal issue in the case arises out of the following facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.727" offset="385217">The Petitioner, Citicorp Industrial Credit, financed the manufacturing operations of a now defunct entity known as the Ely Group under an ordinary secured financing arrangement that gave Petitioner a security interest, which Petitioner properly perfected, in Ely's accounts receivable and inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.453" offset="464211">Approximately one-year later, Ely went out of business, defaulted on its obligations to Petitioner, and also failed to meet its payrolls in the last weeks of its operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.231" offset="507261">Two district courts found... and this is a quote from both of those opinions... that:</text>
            <text syncTime="94.947" offset="534115">"Both the employees and the secured creditor are innocent parties, the culprit being the manufacturer. "</text>
            <text syncTime="101.523" offset="560446">Factually, therefore, the case fits the classic insolvency mold: no creditor is at fault, the debtor's assets are insufficient to satisfy all creditors, some will be paid and some will not.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.266" offset="619379">So that the crucial practical question becomes, how do you determine which claims will be paid, which will be paid ahead of the others, and what law governs that priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.167" offset="667026">The Secretary and the lower courts contend that that question is answered by our minimum wage and hour law, and that the FLSA resolves this issue in favor of the unsecured wage claimants because the FLSA's so-called hot goods provision, Section 15(a)(1), permits any person from shipping goods produced in violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.377" offset="751872">That view, if adopted by this Court, is going to work some very large changes in state and federal statutes that specifically deal with the priorities of creditors' claims in cases of insolvency, notwithstanding the fact that even the Government agrees that there is no evidence Congress intended that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.446" offset="836090">Everyone agrees that Congress has never considered whether the hot goods provision should apply to secured creditors.</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="176.616" offset="860855">Mr. Lee, has this question just never come up before in the context of a secured creditor?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="182.441" stopTime="234.859">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="182.441" offset="884156">The Fair Labor Standards Act was... it has come up at least twice... well, several times.</text>

            <text syncTime="812.204" offset="3403196">Now, there is also a batch of federal statutes that will necessarily be affected by the Secretary's interpretation of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.964" offset="3462232">They include: the Bankruptcy Act, which, like the UCC, gives secured creditors priority over unpaid wage earners; the Federal Tax Lien Act, under which either the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate, usually the IRS district director, both of whom are clearly persons, have the responsibility of levying and enforcing federal tax liens; and two other federal statutes that give the unpaid sellers of livestock and perishable agricultural commodities a priority over other creditors, including employees whose wages have not been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.636" offset="3612907">The Government observes, and correctly so, that this case does not involve bankruptcy and does not involve any of those other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.197" offset="3643104">But the point is that the literal interpretation of "any person" which the Government seeks will necessarily change a lot of lien statutes that would otherwise be applicable in this circumstance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1833.545" offset="7488538">Well, I think actually that is quite right, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.794" offset="7497524">And there is no conflict that we see between Section 1501 and priorities in bankruptcy, for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.120" offset="7522810">First of all, the Bankruptcy Code itself recognizes the distinction that we have drawn in our statute between regulatory statutes and creditor's rights provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.851" offset="7557710">Section 362(b)(4) and (b)(5), it explicitly permits the Government to prosecute an action to enforce an injunctive... obtain injunctive relief when necessary to enforce public law requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.924" offset="7602014">District courts and bankruptcy courts have uniformly concluded that the Fair Labor Standards Act is precisely that sort of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.969" offset="7626255">So if this were a bankruptcy case, the code itself would permit this very action to proceed and the same relief to be awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.107" offset="7650810">Second of all, we don't think that the application of the Fair Labor Standards Act here affects priorities in bankruptcy at all, even apart from the Section 362(b)(4) and (b)(5) relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.993" offset="7698353">Now, we talked about this at length in our brief, and what I would like to do, with your indulgence, is explain how we think the statute operates and what we think it means, because that I think answers the question about whether or not this affects priorities in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.551" offset="7744538">The short answer is that as a statute like the Flammable Fabrics Act, for example, which we cite in our brief... if flammable fabrics turned up in a bankrupt estate, the trustee certainly couldn't claim that he had a right to sell those fabrics until they were conformed to the requirements of federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2366.799" offset="9621592">First of all, accepting your assumption, it is true that this does not disturb generally priorities in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.155" offset="9646983">Congress was legislating with a particular problem in mind, the problem of employees who did not receive wages, and that is dealt with in this statute explicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.246" offset="9679375">And no matter what any other provision of state law or the Bankruptcy Code says, this is the statute which deals with that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.009" offset="9702363">The second answer to the question again is that this does not affect priorities in bankruptcy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2959.107" offset="11990794">So it may be that there simply were not that many factual situations like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.606" offset="12004796">And I should add that even since 1966 there have been relatively few cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.760" offset="12021410">In order to prosecute an action of this sort, the Secretary has to find the violation and obtain an injunction relatively quickly, and he has to do it in the circumstance in which he thinks it's appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2991.188" offset="12119108">Citicorp's entire argument, I think as the Court generally has noted, is devoted to running away from what Congress actually said in Section 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.840" offset="12149723">Its entire argument is based on cases like Holy Trinity, which relies upon the proposition that Congress here simply didn't know what it was doing when it wrote Section 15(a)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.932" offset="12186086">Whatever the propriety of departing from the statutory language in a situation like that, where Congress specifically intended an outcome in a given case, obviously a claim that Congress didn't know what it was doing is one that should be treated with great skepticism.</text>

            <text syncTime="3032.733" offset="12285246">But I can certainly say that we think that the plain language of the statute is the clearest indication of how the statute should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.325" offset="12315653">And if one even deals with Citicorp on its own ground and says, did Congress mean what it was saying when it wrote Section 15(a)(1), I think there is no question that Congress meant precisely what it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.492" offset="12360270">Citicorp never exactly says precisely what the term "person" should mean if it doesn't mean what it is defined to mean in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.957" offset="12390154">But it sort of hints in its brief that it means perhaps dealers and subcontractors or culpable parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.109" offset="12422755">If Congress had wanted to write those restrictions into the statute, it knew how to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.655" offset="12436966">It wrote precisely those restrictions into other provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.560" offset="12456610">Dealers and manufacturers are dealt with by the child labor prohibitions of Section 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.213" offset="12475209">Willful violators are dealt with in the criminal penalty provisions of Section 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.619" offset="12488792">Other provisions of the Act deal only with employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.962" offset="12506242">But Section 15(a)(1), alone among the substantive prohibitions of the Act, deals with "any person".</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.833" offset="12521707">That could not have been inadvertent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.146" offset="12526931">If there is any doubt about this, Section 15(a)(1) contains two explicit exemptions, one for common carriers, which was added only because Congress didn't want a test of the constitutionality of the statute to arise in a case involving a carrier's obligation to transport goods; the other for certain good faith purchasers which was added in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.655" offset="12604985">That exemption is worth looking at closely, because it is unusually strict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.371" offset="12619823">It is not enough that a purchaser acquire goods for value and in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.323" offset="12635601">To benefit from that exemption, he also must acquire goods in reliance on the producer's written statement of compliance with the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.492" offset="12660365">Now, if Congress felt it necessary to write special exemptions of that sort into Section 15 to benefit two discrete and demonstrably innocent categories of people, it certainly thought that the Act otherwise would reach everyone, no matter how innocent or uninvolved.</text>

            <text syncTime="3190.624" offset="12916887">Our point is that the plain language of the statute applies in a case like this one, where there was the statutory obligation to pay and no pay was made, and where the person as defined in the statute, and Citicorp undoubtedly is a person as defined in the statute, is trying to introduce those goods into interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.443" offset="12988149">Section 15 says on its face that Citicorp shouldn't be able to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.363" offset="13003823">Applying the statute here accomplishes precisely what Congress set out to accomplish when it wrote Section 15, because Congress intended to make sure that everyone... well, Congress intended to apply Section 15 to everyone, so that no one would be able to deal in hot goods, so that everyone would be aware to watch out for hot goods, everyone would be aware that they could not benefit from an employer's failure to pay minimum wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.307" offset="13095565">That is part of the entire enforcement scheme of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.493" offset="13108312">Citicorp's argument to the contrary simply ignores the theory on which the Fair Labor Standards Act operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.835" offset="13129733">I should add one additional thing about this insolvency and bankruptcy point, which we think is a red herring thrown into the case by Citicorp to distract the Court from the plain language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.550" offset="13172574">As I was suggesting before, the Act essentially creates a universal prohibition on anyone's ability to deal with certain types of goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.280" offset="13215519">It does not create property interests in those goods, it does not create liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.981" offset="13226281">It simply says no one can deal with those goods until they have been cured in the meaning of the statute or until the Secretary determines not to bring an enforcement action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.618" offset="13264838">Nothing in that addresses insolvency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.194" offset="13287095">Nothing in that type of enactment addresses priorities in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.631" offset="13304858">It simply, as I say, creates a universal prohibition as a matter of public policy, a familiar type of prohibition that Congress created many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.377" offset="13335891">There is no doubt that if, for example, any of these goods had been flammable rather than hot, they could not have been introduced into interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.515" offset="13360446">And we think precisely the same principle is at stake in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.436" offset="13372045">We urge the Court to apply the statute as it was written, to accomplish the purposes Congress tried to accomplish.</text>

            <text syncTime="3451.797" offset="13961576">But this Court said just last year in Bowen versus American Hospital Association that the implications and limitations of our federal system constitute a major premise of all Congressional legislation and that Congress will not be deemed to have displaced state law unless otherwise the purpose of the Act would be defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.321" offset="14047676">At a very minimum, we submit that means that in making decisions such as in this case some kind of a comparative balance of the comparative impact on state and federal laws must be taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.689" offset="14113086">That does not mean that we are taking the position that Congress did not know what it was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.967" offset="14138164">We are simply saying that in every instance that I am aware of in which the Court has faced the identical situation in this case, Congress was aiming at a particular problem, used language that would sweep in a few other instances, this Court has not simply woodenly said, therefore those other instances were also legislated unintentionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.240" offset="14231264">The only cases that deal with it so far as I am aware are Holy Trinity... and there has been no attempt to distinguish Holy Trinity... this Muniz case, and then there is a case that comes fairly close to it, this Court's recent decision in the Jersey Shore Bank case.</text>
