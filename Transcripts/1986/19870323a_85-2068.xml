            <text syncTime="68.862" offset="421280">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, chronologically developing our case, on January 12, 1981, Constable Rankin, who represents one of the eight constable precincts in Harris County appointed a new deputy, Ardith McPherson.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.463" offset="519605">It is county procedure for a new county employee to be on a 90-day probation period at which the employee and the employer may look each over to determine whether they wish to extend beyond 20 days and go into indeterminate employment there.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.123" offset="630260">The employment period that began on January 12, 1981, would have ended on April 12, 1981.</text>

            <text syncTime="155.472" offset="767664">--on January 20th of 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.783" offset="788875">And just a few blocks away from this courthouse now on March 30th of 1981, he was a victim of an assassination attempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.808" offset="869019">That will be six years from next Monday, and this case goes on and on.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.396" offset="907367">At the constables' office, business was going on as usual.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.423" offset="943520">His new deputy, Ardith McPherson, had been assigned primarily in her initial period as a computer operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.215" offset="1002661">Let me explain one thing about our constables office.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.745" offset="1020738">Our downtown constable is Walter Rankin.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.025" offset="1041845">The other seven constables are scattered all over the county by population groupings there.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.991" offset="1069744">But they are not around the downtown courthouse complex, which has about five court buildings there that generate all of the court process, the majority of the court process that goes out to the other precincts for service.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.860" offset="1129198">The new system which we call JIMS... Justice Information Management System... all of the process throughout the county comes into Constable Rankin's office, and it is put onto computers which plays back in 16 justice of the peace courts scattered over the county, 8 constables offices scattered over the county, the district clerk's office and the county clerk's office both across the street from him, as well as juvenile information goes on these same computers there.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.219" offset="1290635">So that any officer, court or law enforcement who is wanting to know at any particular moment the status of service of process in any of these cases can punch it up on the computer and have the answer right there before him as to what attempts have been made on service, what service has been completed, what service has been rejected because of bad addresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.816" offset="1409022">Anyway, the information is readily available throughout the county, based upon the input by Constable Rankin's office in the first instance before he sends the process out to other officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.124" offset="1462312">Now, when Constable Rankin appointed Ardith McPherson his deputy, he did this under a statute in Texas that says that all of the constable's employees are deputies.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.836" offset="1529185">He is not authorized to employ clerks, people to answer the telephone, people to do the typing.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.114" offset="1562204">Everybody that he employs is a deputy constable.</text>
