            <text syncTime="53.370" offset="361909">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="56.212" offset="373194">The principle this Court must consider in this case is the federalist intention between the power of Indiana to define the bundle of rights inherent in Indiana created corporations and the implicit limitation on that power derived from the commerce clause when Congress has not acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.830" offset="443724">There was a different holding as well in the Seventh Circuit's opinion, and that was a pre-emption holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.718" offset="471205">But the centerpiece of that holding and DCA's argument, I might say, is that it is possible that in light of the controlled share acquisition statute under consideration today, a hostile bidder might wish to keep his tender offer open for 50 days instead of the 28-day or 20 business day minimum currently required by Rule 14(e)1 of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.176" offset="569112">Unlike the position the United States took in this Court in MITE, in this case the United States has argued that the statute is not pre-empted.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.860" offset="615819">Morever, the SEC has taken no exception to that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.373" offset="633896">The SEC, indeed, is a signator on the brief in the same sense as being a part of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.137" offset="652913">And I might say to the Court as well, it has been suggested to me that the SEC did not join in that portion of the United States' argument but similarly there are portions of the commerce clause that only refer to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.664" offset="703068">It strikes me, therefore, that the SEC disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.163" offset="712994">It should have said so, and it has not.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.083" offset="720727">The fundamental issue, then, before this Court is whether the dormant commerce clause limits the ability of Indiana to enact a statute that concededly does not discriminate between in-state and out-of-state acquirers; that unlike the statute this Court considered in MITE, does not pose any possibility of multiple and inconsistent burdens that presents no different kind of alleged burdens on interstate commerce than any number of other corporate statutes regulating the relationships inter sese among shareholders of Indiana created corporations.</text>

            <text syncTime="262.941" offset="1200126">That is that the shareholders... that is a sufficiently important interest, at least as defined by virtually every state corporate statute of which I am aware, that the shareholders have the right to vote on whether a transaction should go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.701" offset="1251221">And if the shareholders say no, then no less in this case, somebody who lives in California who owns shares in the Indiana corporation is prevented from selling those shares one way or another to a New York based corporation located in Connecticut.</text>

            <text syncTime="400.418" offset="1750056">Well, I don't view what I have said as a concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.760" offset="1759460">It's perfectly possible, as the State of Indiana has argued in its brief, that the shareholders of an Indiana created corporation can take those kinds of considerations into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.179" offset="1797076">But it isn't necessary, and ultimately it's the shareholders who get to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.380" offset="1817869">It's not the State of Indiana that gets to decide, which again is unlike the situation in MITE.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.409" offset="1838036">Remember that ultimately what occurs is that shareholders get to vote, and if the shareholders decide that they are better off with somebody from outside the state saying, we want your company, that's the way it goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.216" offset="1889236">If this is a way to preserve Indiana corporations in Indiana, it fails.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.229" offset="1913269">One of the benefits and the burdens of the Indiana business corporation law is this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.802" offset="1963633">Shareholders in certain limited Indiana corporations have been provided the right to vote unless they or the board of directors say otherwise, and by that of course the shareholders themselves can opt out of this kind of statute by an amendment to the articles of incorporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.951" offset="2040224">The board of directors can opt out by virtue of a by-law amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.324" offset="2053703">But in all events, if that occurs or fails to occur, then the shareholders are given the opportunity to have voting rights to determine whether someone acquires one-fifth or more, one-third or more, or one-half or more of the voting power of an Indiana corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.208" offset="2121203">If the grant of voting power is approved, then shareholders properly exercising dissenter's rights in the same way they are granted dissenter's rights in merger transactions, can seek and obtain appraisal.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.344" offset="2173762">The State of Indiana has concluded that this potential change in status of a shareholder is sufficiently significant that the shareholder should have a say in the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.025" offset="2220469">The effect of such an acquisition of control could be effectively to disenfranchise them.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.022" offset="2248472">Take as an example, if someone acquires an excess of 50 percent of the outstanding voting power of a corporation, the remaining shareholders have utterly no vote in their future.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.988" offset="2284312">The United States agrees with the State of Indiana that the shareholders have a significant interest in the outcome of that kind of change of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.280" offset="2329556">CTS submits that none of DCA, the Seventh Circuit, or even the United States has identified for this Court a constitutionally cognizable line that says on the one hand, the control share acquisition statute impermissibly burdens interstate commerce and on the other hand, any of a number of statutes implicating the passing of control, such as cumulative voting rights, merger transactions, super-majority requirements for mergers, provisions for staggered boards, or even the ability to vote annually for directors or a class of directors do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.547" offset="2478558">If the Court constitutionalizes state corporate law in this case, there is no doctrinal bright line to prohibit the same result in any of a number of a long list of attributes of virtually every corporate statute that can be alleged to impede the so-called interstate market for corporate control.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.054" offset="2552642">Yet, these are provisions that have inhered in the corporate statutes for years without any serious question of constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.550" offset="2590572">If the control share acquisition statute is unconstitutional because it is different or it is new, then the states are effectively prohibited from taking into account future changes in economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.420" offset="2638114">Corporations are exclusively creatures of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.231" offset="2665282">They exist, if at all, because a given state enacted a statute allowing the corporation to come into existence, and accepted articles of incorporation that complied with that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.616" offset="2710839">Most importantly, when anyone determines to purchase a share of stock in a corporation chartered by a state, he also buys the bundle of rights and the obligations defined by the totality of the chartering state's laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.844" offset="2767786">That is and must be true whether the shares are sold exclusively intrastate or in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.326" offset="2801641">That bundle of rights inherent in a share of stock governs everything from the value on liquidation and dissolution, the rights to dividends, if any, the ability to participate in shareholders meetings, if at all, the amount of that participation, and the kinds of issues in which participation is allowed, all the way through to whether the share of stock can be transferred as in Aldridge, and if so, under what conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.267" offset="2913445">The very existence and nature of voting rights is solely a function of the chartering state's law, whether the share of stock is traded in interstate commerce or in intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.731" offset="2963287">Indeed, it couldn't be any other way under the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.933" offset="2980109">No magic transformation occurs in a share of stock when the share is placed in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.961" offset="3004247">State law, not federal law, still governs the voting rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.553" offset="3022637">And to date no one has suggested, at least directly that, one share, one vote, has been imposed on the chartering state's law by the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.486" offset="3062343">Indeed, to the contrary, one only has to remember that under the common law it was the shareholder who had one vote, not vote based on the number of shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.811" offset="3103616">Delaware has chartered corporations where it was possible under the articles of incorporation for a person to have declining voting rights as the share power increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.338" offset="3149696">As the United States at least recognizes, necessarily there will be so-called extraterritorial effects of the chartering state's law because the benefits and burdens constitutionally must follow the stock wherever it goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.251" offset="3217406">Thus, and pursuant to a chartering state's statutory merger procedure, the will of the majority or super-majority of the shareholders is that a merger not occur, then it will not occur even though the practical effect is to stop a New York corporation from acquiring an Indiana corporation and stopping a shareholder from California from selling... the ability to sell shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.336" offset="3313745">Indeed, under the merger statutes, if the directors don't even submit the proposal to the shareholders at all, the shareholders never get the right to vote at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.207" offset="3353243">No one, not DCA, not the Seventh Circuit, not even the United States, has suggested that such a merger statute impermissibly burdens interstate commerce, even though it quite obviously potentially stops the interstate, international commerce of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.138" offset="3424923">Even though the United States concedes the fundamental premises on which the CTS argument rests, it nonetheless argues that the statute is unconstitutional under the commerce clause because its provisions on voting rights are triggered by purchase and sale, what they call transactions involving shares, and although there is no facial discrimination between interstate and intrastate commerce, most of these transactions as they are called would take place in interstate commerce and the statute preserves whatever pattern of voting rights exists at a given time against transactions that would alter that pattern in significant ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.964" offset="3592211">But each of the United States' points is refuted either by decisions of this Court, or its own argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.774" offset="3623453">That there can be transactions at all is purely a function of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.913" offset="3644038">This Court squarely held that in Aldridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.693" offset="3655114">Transferability of shares in a corporation stems from state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.894" offset="3679982">Characterizing the triggering event for application of the statute as a "transaction" adds nothing to the analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.389" offset="3721987">The easiest way to demonstrate that for the Court's purposes is to take a look at the partnership laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.934" offset="3748109">Again, partnerships are creatures of states.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.745" offset="3759394">State laws inherently say, virtually without exception, you cannot transfer the voting power inherent in a unit of a limited partnership or inherent in a general partnership interest without the agreement of somebody else, either the general partners or the limited partners as the case may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.300" offset="3845598">If this statute falls on that basis, likewise every partnership law has to fall on the same basis because those are transactions where the economic benefits are transferred and the voting rights are, to use the term so often used by the other side and by the Court, stripped by virtue of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.353" offset="3921772">To bring it home, one of the hottest products hitting the intrastate market today is units in master limited partnerships.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.490" offset="3958343">No one can seriously contend that state partnership laws violate the commerce clause because the voting rights are stripped away, even though that's plainly an interstate commerce kind of transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.814" offset="4011633">The United States argument says that most transactions occur in interstate commerce, but that likewise adds little to the analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.839" offset="4063773">This Court has totally refuted a disproportionate impact theory in its decision in Exxon and in its decision in Commonwealth Edison Co. versus Montana in which this Court upheld direct burdens which fell disproportionately on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.160" offset="4133050">Morever, if there is an impermissible disproportionate impact arising from the control share acquisition statute, that must be equally true of merger statutes because in mergers, no less than in controlled transactions, the shareholders have the right to accept or reject something that the state says is significantly and sufficiently important that they have the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.916" offset="4228031">The great bulk of merger transactions, no less than these kinds of transactions, will occur in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.351" offset="4257811">The United States has apparently recognized this particular weakness in its argument, and attempts to distinguish mergers because they involve structural changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.363" offset="4301801">But I have found no evidence in decisions of this Court or in the Constitution itself that says that there is any difference between structural changes, fundamental changes, transactional changes or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.012" offset="4364390">It simply does not arise out of the commerce clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1079.923" offset="4468044">--Justice Scalia, you raise, really for me two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.500" offset="4482359">Balancing is certainly language that this Court has used often, but it is possible to look at virtually every one of those cases, and there is only one exception cited by the United States, as either a discrimination case or a multiple burden, multiple and inconsistent burden case, and we set that out in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.742" offset="4551323">Let me take it another way for you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.773" offset="4559473">The state defines "structure".</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.709" offset="4575251">That is the starting point, so it's not a question of balancing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.036" offset="4596567">It's a question of what property rights does the state give, and that's for the state to define.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.815" offset="4619659">If it is to be otherwise, then there is a way to handle the problem and that is to go to the United States Congress where these kinds of issues are supposed to be, and have the United States Congress define for us what the interstate market in corporate control is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.902" offset="4679949">But historically, that hasn't happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.573" offset="4690712">It certainly hasn't happened to date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.228" offset="4697295">Have I responded to your question adequately?</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.601" offset="4726761">We'll find out, won't we.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.273" offset="4733448">What is key from our standpoint is whether the chartering state is allowed to say, or allowed to believe that certain changes in the entity owned by the shareholders are so important that the shareholder should have a voice in whether those changes occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.560" offset="4822578">Whether a change is called structural, transactional or anything else has little to do, if anything, with the shareholder's ultimate interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.478" offset="4858314">Again, to bring that home, a shareholder is as cut out from the process of controlling his investment that if a single dominant shareholder elects the board of directors as he is if he receives a nonvoting preferred stock in exchange for his common stock in a merger transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.690" offset="4927172">The effect on him is precisely the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="1342.645" offset="5519003">Judge Posner concluded in his opinion that the statute, in his words, set up a gauntlet that few tender offers could run.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.734" offset="5563306">This is strong and colorful language, but on what basis did he reach these conclusions?</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.685" offset="5587130">He gives us only two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.652" offset="5594967">First, since in his view no rational bidder seeking control of an Indiana corporation would purchase the shares without knowing the outcome of the shareholder vote, and since the shareholder vote could not transpire except after 50 days, that the statute as a practical matter imposes a 50-day delay on the consummation of tender offers and he considered that this would be burdensome.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.253" offset="5693396">Second, he stated that by virtue of the fact that the statute requires a shareholder vote, the success of the offer is, as he put it, subject to the tender mercies of the existing shareholders of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.013" offset="5748462">On the first point, we submit that Judge Posner was simply wrong because he failed to consider the practical alternatives that are open to a bidder in a tender offer to which the statute applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.366" offset="5805827">We demonstrate in our brief that nothing in the statute delays the commencement of a tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.535" offset="5834562">There is no pre-notification requirement like the one that this Court dealt with in MITE.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.081" offset="5852743">Nothing in the statute prevents shareholders from tendering their shares immediately to the bidder, to the bidder's escrow agent, as soon as the offer has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.779" offset="5895479">And importantly, nothing in the statute prevents the bidder from accepting the shares that have been tendered for payment, thus consummating the purchase immediately after the minimum 28-day waiting period that is provided for in the &lt;SEC's&gt; [= SEC's] rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.053" offset="5956606">We may concede Judge Posner's point that many bidders seeking control would want the voting rights issue resolved before they paid for the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.300" offset="5997566">But this desire is easily accommodated as the bidder could request the shareholder election on the same day he presents the offer, and structure the offer so that the acceptance of the tendered shares for payment was conditioned upon the later outcome of a favorable vote on the voting rights issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.806" offset="6079590">This would have the effect of locking up the stock so far as the bidder was concerned, and it would also cut off shareholders' right to withdraw their shares after the acceptance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.786" offset="6127551">Your Honors, this procedure is not new.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.676" offset="6139045">It is followed every day in many tender offers which are subject to conditions such as the receipt of required regulatory approvals such as those imposed by the Federal Communications Commission, by the Federal Reserve Board, by the Insurance Commissioners of various states who are required to approve a transfer of control before it takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.479" offset="6234340">It is also followed when offers are conditioned on the dismantling of certain defenses that the targets of these tender offers have erected, such as poison pills, so that to condition the acceptance for payment on the receipt of voting rights is no different from the practice that prevails in other contexts routinely in the tender offer area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.671" offset="6343114">In fact, so common is this practice that the SEC has provided explicit guidance on the subject in its interpretive releases which we quote in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.214" offset="6377282">And it is instructive, we believe, that despite the opportunity to do so in its brief, the SEC did not take the position that the 50-day period for the election would result in any actual delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.802" offset="6435587">Even if the statute did delay the consummation of the purchase for 50 days, that period is limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.440" offset="6466098">It is not an unlimited period as the Court dealt with in MITE.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.969" offset="6484279">And I know it is only 22 days longer than the minimum period of 28 days that is prescribed by the SEC's own rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.934" offset="6524090">So, much more is required, we submit, than unsupported speculation to find that this so burdens tender offers as to render the Indiana statute unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.211" offset="6565259">This is especially true, Your Honors, when there has been no showing that there are defenses which the target could put into place in 50 days that the target couldn't also put into place in 28 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.628" offset="6614892">Furthermore, we believe that no showing could be made that hostile tender offers can normally be concluded in 28 days, given the litigation that swirls around these corporate wars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.248" offset="6669331">Turning to the second point, Judge Posner felt that the shareholder vote, the fact that a shareholder vote had to take place, was a burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.100" offset="6728785">However, it seems self-evident that if the majority of the shareholders wished to tender their shares in response to a tender offer, they will also vote to confer voting rights because only by conferring voting rights will they be able ultimately to receive payment from the bidder.</text>

            <text syncTime="1798.149" offset="7340991">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.897" offset="7363979">Let me see if I can clarify Justice Scalia's and Justice Stevens' concern over the mathematics here, because it is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.378" offset="7389892">Let's take this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.595" offset="7398774">Bidder, my client, owned approximately 27 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.047" offset="7416537">To may it easier, if the bidder had owned 20 percent and if the insiders who also have interested shares and were disqualified from voting, if they owned another ten percent that's 70 percent... that's 30 percent which leaves 70 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.464" offset="7474216">The statute requires a majority of the disinterested shares outstanding, but in all these cases... in no case do all the shareholders vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.351" offset="7505772">The average is about, let's say, ten percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.178" offset="7513086">Now we are down to 60 percent--</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.834" offset="7519669">The statute also has a strange quirk because it doesn't disqualify the shares of directors who are not officers of the corporation, but we know because of structural bias who it is who puts those directors in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.031" offset="7572540">It's management, and those folks are going to vote for management for sure, not to give the vote to a prospective bidder here.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="1861.998" offset="7596364">Mr. Sachnoff, when you said ten percent about the number of shareholders, did you mean ten percent don't vote?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lowell_e_sachnoff" startTime="1867.214" stopTime="2275.221">
            <label>Mr. Lowell E. Sachnoff</label>
            <text syncTime="1867.214" offset="7617262">That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.229" offset="7625308">That is correct, ten percent generally... that's an oversimplification but for purposes of this hypothetical you never get all the shareholders of a public corporation to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.508" offset="7654460">So, if you take it... we are down, now, Justice Scalia, to 50 percent and the bidder has to get 36 percent of that 50 percent which is over 70 percent, as Justice Stevens figured out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.080" offset="7700749">That is one of the numerous things that takes this level playing field and begins to tilt it against the bidder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.797" offset="7727603">I think that's a good introduction to the place I think this case ought to start and that is with Judge Posner's comments in his opinion, his lingering doubts about whether or not the Williams Act really pre-empts state takeover statutes such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.338" offset="7793745">And to put it in terms that this Court has stated on numerous occasions, the question is whether or not the state regulation or statute stands as an obstacle to accomplishing the purposes and the objectives of the Williams Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.911" offset="7848080">Now, if we remove these lingering doubts, and if Your Honors in this case do that, then it becomes unnecessary to get into the great silences of the commerce clause and it becomes unnecessary to go into the second branch that's troubled the lower courts in all of these cases, which is trying to figure out whether this is a strict scrutiny kind of case or whether it's a pike-balancing test case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.353" offset="7941807">The focus ought to be, at least, first on the Williams Act because I believe that Justice White's opinion, the plurality opinion, was quite correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.913" offset="7976080">I think "crystal clear" is what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.538" offset="7982558">And that is that the Williams Act's principal purpose is to protect the shareholder, to protect the autonomy of the investor, and that autonomy is protected by maintaining this neutrality between the bidder on the one hand and management on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.502" offset="8038356">That is the way that the shareholder's interest is protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.220" offset="8053298">Now, the Indiana chapter and the other controlled share chapters like it in other states, tilt that balance drastically against the bidder and they do it in at least four or five different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.103" offset="8100841">First off, they introduced this element of delay, and there is at least a 22-day delay and probably more because election contests generally occur in connection with what we are talking about, which is a proxy contest superimposed on a tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.129" offset="8164893">A point that Mr. Strain and Mr. Pritchard didn't make is that every tender offer, every tender offer for an Indiana corporation necessarily involves a proxy contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.671" offset="8203032">That is, unless management says, okay, you can take over my company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.577" offset="8214735">But that doesn't happen, as in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.575" offset="8222676">What happens is that the bidder has to have a proxy contest with management to try to get these votes, the 50 percent or the majority of the disinterested shares, and that proxy contest is an immense additional burden on the tender offeror which the Williams Act never contemplated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.132" offset="8288923">Under the Williams Act a tender offeror makes a tender, sends out the solicitations to all the shareholders, and the shareholder in Oregon gets this letter in the mail that says, I'd like to buy your shares at this premium, and all the shareholder has to do is say yes or no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.282" offset="8341481">In this case we need a proxy contest on top of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.592" offset="8354751">Next, in addition to the delay, there is the uncertainty because a tender offer involves a tremendous amount of sunk costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.496" offset="8386412">The sunk costs include all of the legal expenses and accounting expenses and printing and mailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.478" offset="8410340">In addition to that, in order to line up a tender offer that makes any sense at all, you have to be able to say to the shareholders of the corporation, we have the financing lined up to be able to make this tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.505" offset="8450359">That financing involves commitment fees with merchant bankers and investment bankers usually in the range of one to one and a half percent, and on a $100 million tender offer, which is not a large one, that's a million and a half dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.938" offset="8500096">So, we are talking about a tender offeror committing to spend two to three million dollars up front which he'll never get back at all if, as Judge Posner put it, the tender mercies of these outside shareholders, the disinterested shareholders, don't give that tender offeror the vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.103" offset="8568746">The statute is truly a gauntlet through which the bidder has to run in order to get the vote, in order to accomplish his or her principal goal in making a tender offer, which is getting control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.224" offset="8617229">The deck is stacked against the bidder and it's stacked against the bidder because of the vote that I discussed earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.972" offset="8640322">It's also stacked against the bidder because it takes away investor autonomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.500" offset="8658398">The purpose of the Williams Act is to provide information to the investor, to the shareholder, so that he or she can make an independent judgment, shall I tender my shares or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.715" offset="8699254">And Justice O'Connor asked a question earlier, this is a strange way to protect shareholders' votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.244" offset="8721406">You say to the 20 percent shareholder, your votes are stripped away unless you go through all these hoops in order to get a majority of the disinterested vote, and what it says to the shareholder who is in Oregon who would like to tender his or her shares to the bidder in Connecticut or Florida is, you can't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.128" offset="8788906">You can't tender your shares unless the bidder runs this gauntlet and is able to get a majority of the supposedly disinterested shareholders to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.499" offset="8826418">So, the process, looked at in a very practical way that Indiana imposes on the bidder, is a stacked deck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.464" offset="8862258">Just last night... every time I read the statute I come up with something else, another little hoop to go through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.649" offset="8887022">I really discovered this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.883" offset="8891933">It's not in our briefs but it's in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.585" offset="8902696">The statute provides for record date of 70 days before the meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.036" offset="8916488">That's in another section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.301" offset="8921608">It's in 2330.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.410" offset="8930072">The Controlled Share Act requires a meeting if requested by an acquiring person, within 50 days but that is 50 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.080" offset="8960687">If the management sets a record date 20 days earlier, that means that there are 20 days of trading during which shareholders of that corporation will have sold their stock but still be record date shareholders for purposes of voting on whether or not this tender offeror has the right to vote these shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.336" offset="9037696">Those shareholders are going to get this proxy thing in the mail and they couldn't give two hoots whether or not the bidder gets the vote or doesn't get the vote because they are out of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.271" offset="9077507">And it's like a little archeological dig to go through that chapter but it is filled, as I said, with these pitfalls which tend to keep inclining that balance that Congress in the Williams Act said ought to be neutral, ought to establish this neutrality, keeps sloping it against the bidder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.733" offset="9143336">What it adds up to is that it chills tender offers and deters them because it is true that no rational tender offeror is going to run this gauntlet, incur these expenses, and risk all this uncertainty where there is no guarantee, and in a process that is totally controlled by management when there is no guarantee that at the end of the line he is going to have the one thing he is looking for which is this vote, the vote which exists in the national market for corporate control.</text>

            <text syncTime="2316.675" offset="9415114">What I am really saying is that no tender offeror will take all of these chances to make a tender offer when this kind of a mine field is in front of him or her.</text>

            <text syncTime="2991.559" offset="12114607">That's on the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.434" offset="12118160">Another point that I wanted to make is that Mr. Strain in the beginning of his presentation indicated that perhaps there was a misstatement in CTS's reply brief, and it is an important one because the government has filed a brief in this case, two branches of the government, the government... that is, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.877" offset="12215858">Both the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission support DCA, our position, and that is that the commerce clause renders the Indiana statute invalid because of the excessive burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.026" offset="12288478">But in the reply brief CTS says in effect that the SEC also throws in the towel on the Williams Act; that is, that the SEC says that the Williams Act does not pre-empt the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.444" offset="12338111">It is an important point, that that is not the case; that the government's brief is very carefully drafted in such a way that it is only the Justice Department and not the SEC that says the Williams Act doesn't pre-empt the statute, because of course the SEC argued in MITE, the SEC argued in Kidwell, the SEC argued in Household in the Delaware Supreme Court that the Williams Act did in fact pre-empt those state statutes because it was an obstacle to tender offers, got in... as they say, got in the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.447" offset="12458170">The other point that I wanted to make, which is also raised in the reply brief that was filed by CTS and we didn't have, obviously, a chance to respond in writing, is this notion that this is only a private matter, private individuals, and the state really isn't involved in the obstacles to the Williams Act or the burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.640" offset="12546986">That point is sort of stunning because Indiana has enacted a blueprint, a very detailed blueprint here, under which the corporations chartered by the State of Indiana can invoke these burdens and obstacles and it's subject to the same kind of analysis that this Court has done on many occasions under the Fourteenth Amendment because finding state action means finding a state that provides an impetus or a blueprint for private individuals to violate rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.223" offset="12669239">Obviously, only states can violate the commerce clause in the same sense that individuals generally have their rights that are violated under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.468" offset="12702258">So that, this blueprint is such a complete and detailed prescription for management of target corporations that it is very clear that the State is behind this.</text>

            <text syncTime="3386.823" offset="13695643">It stops the Connecticut bidder from buying a share from the Oregon shareholder in this market that really has next to nothing to do with the internal governance matters of a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.709" offset="13739215">My last point is to respond to Justice Powell's point about whether or not the statute is designed to protect state businesses and I think the State of Indiana's brief indicates that it is designed to check the removal of Indiana corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.421" offset="13802118">And my point there is that there are lots more less intrusive ways of doing that than interfering with interstate commerce or setting up an obstacle to tender offers under the Williams Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.496" offset="13846317">The states have senators who can lobby in the national Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.712" offset="13859274">States really ought to, if they want to attract and keep business, they can set up Silicon Valleys and Route Ones.</text>

            <text syncTime="3435.273" offset="13889471">But that's the kind of competition I think the commerce clause was designed to stimulate among the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.738" offset="13907339">Lastly, the ingenuity of corporate takeover lawyers apparently knows no bounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.955" offset="13932207">They come up with the evolution of poison pills which have been upheld by the courts as a means of blocking or thwarting unwanted takeovers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.108" offset="13964808">So, there are presently in place structures that can accomplish the goal, the concern that I believe Justice Powell raised both in the MITE case and here today.</text>
