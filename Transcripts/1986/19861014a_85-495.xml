            <label>Mr. Thomas N. Sullivan</label>
            <text syncTime="73.898" offset="440968">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.481" offset="447342">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="79.500" offset="463433">This case raises two issues with regard to the provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibit discrimination by an employer against an employee because of his religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.926" offset="517141">The first issue is whether an employee who needs to be absent from work to observe his religion, and who is provided a combination of paid leave and unpaid leave for that purpose, proves a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII, based upon the employer's refusal to compensate him for all of his absence for religious observance.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.208" offset="610242">The second question posed is whether an employer who has implemented a reasonable accommodation of an employee's religion, is nevertheless required to accept the accommodation the employee prefers, absent the showing of undue hardship and the conduct of the employer's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.670" offset="688087">Now, the essential facts in this case are as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="140.657" offset="708044">The respondent, Ronald Philbrook, is a public high school teacher, employed by the petitioner, Ansonia School Board, as a business teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.631" offset="747959">Since 1968, Philbrook has been a member of the Worldwide Church of God, and as such, he is required by his faith to absent himself for approximately six days a year from his employment to observe religious holy days.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.391" offset="810967">Under the governing collective bargaining agreement, all of the school board's teachers, including Philbrook, are provided three days annual paid leave for religious observance.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.032" offset="861540">Teachers are also provided under the agreement with 18 days of annual leave for other reasons, such as illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.721" offset="896335">And these are confined to specific numbers of days per occurrence per reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.843" offset="936772">Teachers are also provided, in addition to the three days for religious observance and the 18 days of annual leave, with three days of annual leave for necessary personal business.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.967" offset="989331">Under the specific provisions of the bargaining agreement, these days may not be used for any reason for which leave is otherwise provided under the bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.275" offset="1030500">And they may be used only for reasons which require a teacher's absence from work.</text>

            <text syncTime="263.935" offset="1201131">The evidence in terms of Philbrook's absences for religion relate back to the 1970-71 school year, which you can see set forth in the appendix to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.760" offset="1252436">The record is not clear in this case as to how he was treated prior to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.579" offset="1275737">It's our understanding that he was allowed, up until the 1970-71 school year, all of the leave he needed, with pay, for religious observance.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.204" offset="1318264">So that the change came when the parties to the bargaining agreement negotiated specific restrictions on the use of personal leave.</text>

            <text syncTime="307.062" offset="1373644">Counsel, is it possible, since the court below didn't really decide these factual questions on how the three-day personal leave provision was in fact administered, or how Mr. Philbrook was treated with regard to it, that some remand might be necessary on the 703 issue?</text>

            <text syncTime="331.579" offset="1471760">--Your Honor, we don't think so, and for this reason: We feel that the record in this case permits no other conclusion than that the leave provisions of the contract have been consistently interpreted in accordance with the explicit provisions of the contract so as to preclude the use of necessary personal business leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.076" offset="1561726">And that's the leave we're really talking about here, those three days which Philbrook claims ought to be allowed for religious observance.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.598" offset="1591819">Those three days, under the contract, cannot be used for any reason for which leave is otherwise provided.</text>

            <text syncTime="371.620" offset="1631943">Even under the terms of the contract, it looks like the one day which can be granted on the request of the teacher alone without any inquiry at all would lend itself to use for any purpose whatever, in practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="387.364" offset="1694846">The one day that the teacher can use by only stating the reason is a personal reason still can only be used under the contract for reasons which require the teacher's absence from work.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.591" offset="1755763">And that one day, even though discretionary in the sense that the teacher need only state, it's for a personal reason, cannot be used for one of the reasons for which leave is otherwise provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.781" offset="1796514">We feel the contract is clear on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.233" offset="1806336">And the record shows that the superintendant of schools strictly enforced these leave provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.720" offset="1828279">There's no evidence to the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="444.252" offset="1922424">That it may be something so confidential that the teacher wouldn't want to spread it on the record, or something of that sort?</text>

            <text syncTime="453.355" offset="1958891">In collective bargaining agreements, personal day leave provisions, it's not unusual to give a teacher a discretionary day, because the reason may be so personal as to cause embarrassment if it's shared with anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.346" offset="2010823">But it still must be a day that requires the teacher's absence from work.</text>

            <text syncTime="865.152" offset="3606069">First of all, the Court said: Is there a conflict between the employee's religious needs and the job requirements?</text>

            <text syncTime="1647.102" offset="6733866">I think the language clearly indicates that reasonable accommodation is the obligation of the employer and the union; and that once that is met, there's no reason to go beyond that determination that there's been a reasonable accommodation of the employee's religious practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.849" offset="6808785">Undue hardship really, in effect, creates a defense to a failure to reasonable accommodate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.936" offset="6837207">And in terms of allowing a person to resolve that conflict between their religious practices and their employment obligations in a manner which allows them to continue the employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.792" offset="6876599">I think that the cases the Second Circuit talks about, or those termination cases, where clearly there was no reasonable accommodation or there's a reason to inquire whether there was a reasonable accommodation, or whether something could have been to allow a reasonable accommodation, in the sense of allowing an employee to continue in his employment and observe his religious obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.942" offset="6981193">I'd also like to speak to a claim that Mr. Philbrook makes that he is really in a situation of substantial pay, no work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.631" offset="7023930">I submit that the only evidence referred to by Mr. Philbrook is three pages of the transcript which have nothing to do with that which merely state that there was education going on because he had a plan for the students to follow during the course of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.176" offset="7094147">And that in that... in those three pages of transcript, evidence designed to deal with the question of whether there was a problem with the educational experience caused by the use of substitute teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.952" offset="7153184">And I think there's nothing in there that talks about the amount of time that would be spent, or that in effect there is no work without pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="3013.653" offset="12200041">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.992" offset="12229402">The United States appears here in a dual role.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.861" offset="12240896">We are the principal enforcer of Title VII, and we are also the nation's largest employer subject to the strictures of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.383" offset="12282901">So it's important for us to get it right, and to situate Title VII within the constitutional landscape of the two religion clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.940" offset="12325220">The free exercise clause sets the floor on the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.726" offset="12340371">It's addressed to prohibitions, prohibitions on belief and exercise, and by extension, to discriminatory treatment... discriminatory treatment of religion and religious exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.700" offset="12388227">After that, we believe there is wide room for accommodation by government, as for instance, 5 U.S.C. 550a, which deals with religious observance by federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.258" offset="12434411">And also there's wide room for government to mandate accommodation by private parties before there is a bumping up against the ceiling of the establishment clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.915" offset="12485089">The establishment clause involves entanglement, preference and the imposing of religion on the citizen by support.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.207" offset="12526258">But as Justice Marshall said in the Hardison case, accommodation is not establishment, even though the accommodation is not required by the free exercise clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.531" offset="12575577">Title VII, in our view, operates largely in that space between the floor and the ceiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.585" offset="12603789">It repeats the floor obligation, government may not prohibit, government may not discriminate, in its treatment of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.059" offset="12645690">But it extends it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.959" offset="12649242">It extends it to private employers; that already goes beyond the free exercise clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.980" offset="12669304">And it extends it in another very important way, which may be implicated in this case, that is, where there is a disparate impact... not disparate treatment but a disparate impact... on religious observance, there is a duty to accommodate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.258" offset="12738477">Now, we stay clear of the ceiling set by the Thorton case, because that duty is only a duty to accommodate reasonably, and it's limited in any event by undue hardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.066" offset="12793647">In this case, we have possibly a case of straightforward discriminatory treatment because, and I think we need a remand to the District Court, and we support the judgment of the Court of Appeals for that reason, we need to know about this personal business leave, because if these personal days are in fact an almost wide open, take the time off if you like, or at least one day of it is, we consider, as does Mr. Rosen, that it would be offensive, that it would be discriminatory treatment for an employer to say, take the day off, do whatever you want, just don't pray; just don't go to church.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.463" offset="12975251">Do anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.280" offset="12978490">Just don't go to church.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.763" offset="12984446">That is discriminatory treatment, and would, for that reason alone, violate Title VII.</text>

            <text syncTime="3229.877" offset="13064903">But we do have... we do have the specific language which says you got three days for mandated religious observance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.900" offset="13101056">And then they go into a good bit of detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.035" offset="13109520">And then it's excluded, however, for any religious activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.588" offset="13127806">So the exclusion is much wider.</text>

            <text syncTime="3247.738" offset="13136374">Because the category from which you're excluding is necessary personal business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.409" offset="13155078">When you exclude religious observance as a subcategory of necessary personal business, you're excluding necessary religious observance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.800" offset="13200635">Which seems to me to be the same thing as mandated religious observance.</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_fried" startTime="3267.169" stopTime="3297.938">
            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="3267.169" offset="13214114">I think with respect, Justice Scalia, that they do talk, at least in some versions of the collective bargaining agreement, and all versions are relevant, because we've got a back pay claim here, too, in some versions they spell out what they mean by mandated religious observance, and it talks about days required by the rules of the church.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.765" offset="13300527">Religious activity is not spelled out in that way, and might involve other activities other than the observance of a particular holy day--</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.271" offset="13334487">In any event--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3297.938" offset="13337203">Well, might that be another issue that it would be well to have clarified, if there is a remand?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_fried" startTime="3301.842" stopTime="3479.374">
            <label>Mr. Charles Fried</label>
            <text syncTime="3301.842" offset="13352772">--Oh, no doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.725" offset="13356325">No doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.608" offset="13359878">And that is why we support a remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.377" offset="13366878">Since there's an alternative reading of that provision, which would be quite unexceptionable in terms of discriminatory treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.150" offset="13401987">It may be that those three days are intended for quite narrow and nonrecurring events, things that don't come around every year, regular as clockwork, or regular as the calendar, and also which are not... which are compelled by external compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.563" offset="13483698">In that event, if that is what we find on remand, then in our view there is no discriminatory treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.567" offset="13511701">There may however be discriminatory impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.871" offset="13528942">That is to say, as Philbrook has been claiming, that because of his particular religious needs, this provision bears on him in a more burdensome way than on other persons; those without those religious needs, or those with only three required religious holidays.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.284" offset="13614519">Now, as to discriminatory impact, it is our view that it is only there that the duty of reasonable accommodation comes in, and as to that duty, that is where we part company with the Court of Appeals, and in fact, join company with all the other Courts of Appeals which have considered this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.614" offset="13699887">And in our view, once we're talking about reasonable accommodation, the only obligation that the employer has is to offer a reasonable accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.356" offset="13750878">If it has done that, he has satisfied his literal obligation under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.111" offset="13781912">Nothing else is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.063" offset="13793719">And it seems to us that in a general way what we're talking about a few days a year, offering unpaid leave is a reasonable accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.004" offset="13845442">It may not be the reasonable accommodation which an employee prefers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.375" offset="13862891">But it is nevertheless a reasonable accommodation, and discharges the obligation under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.029" offset="13889536">I'm quick to say that if you have an employee for whom the problem arises not three times a year, but once a week, to say, well once a week you can take off without pay, that might become another matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.990" offset="13957350">Because at that point you are talking about an imposition on employment status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.675" offset="13976158">You are saying that this man has got to be paid 80 percent of his salary, rather than just missing a few days' pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.531" offset="14003535">And at that point, it may be that leave without pay is not a reasonable accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.452" offset="14031224">But in the context of this case, it is our view that leave without pay is a reasonable accommodation, and discharges the employer's obligation.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3479.374" offset="14062885">It may also be that there's no possible accommodation without an undue burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.493" offset="14075424">I mean, if you're suggesting leave with pay, 52 days a year--</text>

            <text syncTime="3501.204" offset="14150238">And the employee is not accommodated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.073" offset="14161732">But this is all in disparate impact rather than in disparate treatment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.660" offset="14188064">If there are no further questions, I thank the Court for its attention.</text>

            <text syncTime="3535.794" offset="14288583">Also, there is absolutely no evidence that there has ever been a denial of necessary personal leave... necessary personal business leave for anything other than religious observance.</text>
