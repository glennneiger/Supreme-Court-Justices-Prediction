            <text syncTime="13.198" offset="197170">Mr. Weinberg, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert M. Weinberg</label>
            <text syncTime="55.026" offset="364459">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="60.977" offset="388282">This is a class action employment discrimination case brought pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and 42 USC Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.875" offset="451812">The defendants in the case were the employer, Lukens Steel Company, and United Steelworkers of America and two of its locals.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.404" offset="485980">In the courts below, plaintiffs prevailed on some but not all of their claims against the employer, and on one of three claims against the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.837" offset="531747">The unions and the plaintiffs both petitioned this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.007" offset="548361">Both petitions were granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.520" offset="558392">And they've been consolidated for this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.067" offset="568632">The question presented by the union's petition is whether either Title VII or Section 1981 imposes on unions an affirmative duty to combat employer discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.717" offset="635192">The question presented by the plaintiffs' petition is, what statute of limitations should apply to the 1981 claims... to the Section 1981 claims in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.478" offset="682212">I plan to devote my opening argument to the issue raised in the union's petition, the affirmative duty issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.723" offset="715231">My presentation will be in two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.910" offset="731949">I will discuss our legal position, which is quite straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.970" offset="756191">Basically, our position is that the only duty that Title VII imposes on unions with respect to employer discrimination is the duty not to cause or attempt to cause that discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.041" offset="820556">That's the duty stated in Section 703(c)(3) of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.758" offset="843335">That provision leaves no room for any affirmative duty on the part of the unions to combat employer discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.833" offset="875727">Likewise as to Section 1981, this Court has already held in General Building Contractors, that the only duty that Section 1981 imposes is the duty not to engage in intention discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.279" offset="941451">Section 1981 does not impose a duty on any party to combat discrimination by another party.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.728" offset="975306">To interpret either of these statutes to place the affirmative duty on unions to combat employer discrimination would be inconsistent with the role of unions as set forth under our system of labor relations set up by the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.596" offset="1050747">Before I elaborate on these points, I want to address another matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.250" offset="1073317">Plaintiffs who pleaded and tried this case on the theory of an affirmative duty to combat employer discrimination; who argued the case to the Court of Appeals on that theory, now say that this case doesn't raise the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.822" offset="1143639">Plaintiffs are wrong about that, but I think it's worth taking a few minutes to demonstrate why they're wrong, because in the process the legal issues here will be focussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.097" offset="1196720">Plaintiffs' complaint asserted three claims against the unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.031" offset="1224514">Two of the claims were claims that the unions themselves had discriminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.545" offset="1242486">One claim was that the unions had adopted and maintained a discriminatory seniority system; the other was that the unions discriminated in processing grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.556" offset="1290552">The district court found for the union on both of those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.179" offset="1309046">The third claim that was in Plaintiffs' complaint was based on the affirmative duty theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.052" offset="1336527">In the words of the complaint, the unions, quote, failed to act affirmatively to cause the employer to refrain from discriminating against black employees because of their race and color.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.952" offset="1388145">It was on this theory that the district court found the unions liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.403" offset="1409983">And in so finding, the district court did not find that the unions failed generally to oppose employer discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.618" offset="1446868">The findings of the district court and the record are clear that the unions made many such efforts, and many were successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.881" offset="1483858">The court below based the finding of liability on this case on a narrower failure on the unions' part, and that is the repeated failure to assert racial discrimination as a ground for grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.014" offset="1544357">It was that failure that was the breach of the affirmative duty found by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.716" offset="1571211">In this regard, it's very significant that the court did not find that the unions' failure was motivated by racial... was racially motivated.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.648" offset="1618963">It did not find that the unions were giving inferior treatment to black employees as opposed to white employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.770" offset="1651459">And it did not find that the unions' failure to raise race discrimination as a ground for grievances was a racial classification.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert M. Weinberg</label>
            <text syncTime="428.781" offset="1859499">--Your Honor, you don't have to deal with it as a theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.687" offset="1871097">But I think it's useful... because it's not raised in the case... but I think it is useful to understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.716" offset="1903175">It's part of the general context for this case, why it is that what the union did is not a breach of the duty of fair representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.852" offset="1947792">The duty of fair representation does not tell unions what their priority should be or what their tactics should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.770" offset="1979453">It doesn't dictate any substantive position.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.877" offset="1999828">What the duty of fair representation says is, whatever you do with respect to your members, because you have this exclusive authority to act on their behalf, you have to do it without improper motivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.513" offset="2058447">You cannot be discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.121" offset="2064821">You cannot be arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.058" offset="2072553">And you cannot act in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.949" offset="2080181">So that if unions are taking actions which aren't discriminatory, arbitrary, or in bad faith, but are in fact based on some other ground, the duty of fair representation does not come into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.459" offset="2134202">And so--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="498.365" offset="2137859">Did the district court make a finding as to why the union had not raised claims of racial discrimination on grievances?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_m_weinberg" startTime="506.720" stopTime="717.514">
            <label>Mr. Robert M. Weinberg</label>
            <text syncTime="506.720" offset="2171192">--Your Honor, I think it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.111" offset="2176834">But I think you've got to... and I think now is as good a time as any to do that... I think you've got to focus on the various practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.515" offset="2210375">Because it in effect made findings with respect to each of the practices it found the unions liable for.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.371" offset="2237856">And I think it's very helpful in looking at those findings, because it not only shows that this case is in fact an affirmative duty case, but it shows that what the affirmative duty reduces to in practice is judicial second guessing of unions tactics and union priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.504" offset="2322388">I think the basic finding that the union... that the court, district court, made was that the union, when there was another ground available for a grievance, would base the grievance on that other ground, and not on the ground of race discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.576" offset="2390620">But the court recognized that the unions' reluctance to do that... and it was a reluctance, because the unions did, in a number of instances, make claims of race discrimination and grievances... but the court recognized that the unions' reluctance was for tactical reasons, not for racial reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.035" offset="2476511">For example, if a black employee were laid off, and a junior white was kept on the same job, the black employee would have a very solid seniority grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.403" offset="2545996">The layoff is out of order, and he was entitled to keep the job on a seniority basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.916" offset="2568044">To add race discrimination, a claim in that instance, would be of no help to the grievant.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.493" offset="2598346">If he's senior, he'll win; if he's not senior, he'll lose.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.398" offset="2621961">But in addition, and the court found that the union... this was the union's perception.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.551" offset="2650591">There were... there may be disadvantages to the grievant to raise race discrimination in a claim like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.205" offset="2681206">It's difficult to prove race discrimination as this case illustrates.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.872" offset="2707851">Alleging race discrimination when you've already got a solid objective ground like seniority may well tend to complicate and delay resolution of the grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.149" offset="2756961">And in addition, as the court found, it was the union perception that raising race discrimination made it more difficult to settle individual claims with the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.442" offset="2802101">These considerations were testified to by black and white grievance men, including a number of plaintiffs' witnesses... excuse me... and the court accepted these reasons as the reasons for the unions' reluctance.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.433" offset="2870124">Indeed, the court found that by pursuing this approach, the unions had been successful in combatting employer discrimination in a number of areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.540" offset="2914532">I won't quote it here, but at page 93A of the... of the petition appendix in 85-2010, the court goes into great detail about how pressing grievances on objective contract ground in fact successfully combatted employer discrimination in a number of areas where plaintiffs had brought claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1720.883" offset="7027877">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.347" offset="7077719">Let me... I would first like to address the issues raised by the union's cert petition on their liability, and then go on to the issues raised by our cert petition on the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.138" offset="7136860">And let me start off just by elaborating a little for Justice Scalia's benefit on the reasoning of the Court of Appeals, because prima facie, it sounds quite puzzling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.945" offset="7188165">The plaintiffs had contended that there was discrimination in discharges, generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.053" offset="7216586">And several of the named plaintiffs had been discharged by Lukens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.580" offset="7242708">On examining the evidence, the district court found that he couldn't find discrimination generally in discharges, but in discharges with respect to probationary employees, he did find discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.729" offset="7311254">And since the Court of Appeals said that since the issue was presented legitimately by plaintiffs who had the right... standing to present the issue of discrimination in discharges, that satisfied that standing problem on that subissue of probationary discharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.394" offset="7385964">Our... our argument on union liability has three basic points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.501" offset="7414385">First, we disagree in the strongest terms with the union's position that the district court did not find discrimination in the handling of grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.775" offset="7467466">The district court did find that the unions had discriminated on the ground of race by intentionally showing reluctance to file grievances alleging racial discrimination under the racial discrimination provisions of the collective bargaining agreement; a reluctance which was not shown with respect to the other provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2246.312" offset="9129585">And that because the union has the exclusive bargaining right for the members, therefore it has an equal obligation...

I think... back to Justice Stevens' question about whether the motive matters, if a real estate broker has black customers, and in showing them houses, decides to avoid certain white neighborhoods, why, because he's found from experience that if shows black homebuyers houses in those neighborhoods, the houses are suddenly taken off the market, or maybe violence results.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.419" offset="9638032">And so he just doesn't show them to the black homebuyers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2730.163" offset="11065050">But in fact, until at least a year or more after this case was filed, from the beginning of the limitations period, the union had filed only one grievance over testing on job relatedness ground either; and that was over a whole battery of tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.482" offset="11146238">So during the years, except for that one grievance when they were manning a new facility, when the employer was manning a new facility, during the years when the Wunderlicht test was in common use by the employer, day-to-day use, the unions did not grieve that, either on job relatedness ground or on discrimination grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.973" offset="11240279">Similarly with respect to probationary discharges, the union said, well, we didn't grieve probationary discharges; that's across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.627" offset="11274865">But the only ground on which they could have grieved probationary discharges was discrimination, because otherwise the employer had full discretion to discharge employees during the probationary period.</text>

            <text syncTime="3177.790" offset="12855482">The district court rejected the union's claim that the reason they didn't file discrimination claims was because they could get better results by other means.</text>

            <text syncTime="3277.377" offset="13253902">Second, that under Section 1988, instead of looking at the allegations in each individual case, the Court should look at the history and purpose of the statute in question and select the one most appropriate characterization for all actions under that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.495" offset="13326313">And third, following one and two, that the most appropriate characterization for claims under Section 1983, is claims for personal injury.</text>
