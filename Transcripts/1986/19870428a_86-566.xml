            <text syncTime="56.837" offset="371337">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the issues on this appeal from a decision of the California Court of Appeals for the Second Appellate District are whether that court in affirming the order of the Los Angeles County Superior Court in denying the petition of appellants to compel arbitration of the claims asserted against them first incorrectly based its decision squarely on whether, which it says in so many words in the opinion itself, whether it disregarded the ruling of this Court in Southland versus Keating, whether it failed to follow the ruling of this Court in Dean Witter Reynolds versus Byrd by refusing to sever the nonwage claims which it felt were nonarbitrable under Labor Code Section 29, and referring the balance of the claims to arbitration, and whether it erred in applying Labor Code Section 229 in the first instance, contrary to the Federal Arbitration Act and in violation of the supremacy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.629" offset="634547">I think it would be useful to recap very quickly the chronology of the case because we come to you not after a trial, and the record is very limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.568" offset="670283">Mr. Thomas, the appellee in this case, is employed by Kidder Peabody in August of 1982 as an account executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.472" offset="697868">In prior years he had also been employed by other New York Stock Exchange member firms, including Morgan Stanley, E.F. Hutton, and Kenner Fitzgerald.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.310" offset="729215">I make that observation because I think it is only fair to assume that Mr. Thomas either had or should have had a working knowledge of the rules which he says he read in signing the U4.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.083" offset="768399">He had been in the industry for many, many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.535" offset="778116">Rule 347, which provides for the arbitration, is a long-standing rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.689" offset="798805">This Court addressed it in Ware in 1973 and it had been on the books many years before that.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.741" offset="818972">In August of 1982, Mr. Thomas signed the U4, which contains the express arbitration agreement upon which our position is based.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.263" offset="853035">In May of 1984, a dispute arose between Thomas and his colleague, Mr. Johnston, Kidder Peabody, his employer, and Barclay Perry, the manager of the Los Angeles office of Kidder Peabody.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.776" offset="1967105">Now, we started relying on Southland in the very first set of papers we filed in the Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.179" offset="1984764">The original petition to compel arbitration and the motion for an order staying proceedings were based on the Federal Arbitration Act and the memorandum of points and authorities supporting that motion and petition expressly set forth, quoted, and cited both Southland and Moses Cohn, so it isn't as if the state courts of California were not aware of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.509" offset="2066057">Indeed, I cannot explain to you why it is that the Court of Appeals decision simply ignored both Moses Cohn and Southland as well as its companion decision of a sister court, of the Fourth District Court of Appeals in Tenneti versus Shirley.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.667" offset="2118720">The complaint was filed in January, 1985, and the complaint is worthy of examination because it, Mr. Chief Justice, will respond somewhat to your question as to the reach of 229 of the California Labor Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.862" offset="2191445">The complaint cites... is a form complaint which we are now using in California on an optional basis where you check the boxes and then put in some additional narrative statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.836" offset="2231360">It is without question that it asserts only common law claims for conversion, for conspiracy to commit conversion, for the breach of a fiduciary duty, for breach of contract, and for a claim for exemplary and punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.311" offset="2285277">Now, Judge O'Brien referred to these other claims as ancillary to the wage claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.381" offset="2305548">The Court of Appeals describes them in terms of other theories, but there is a little bit more to it than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.535" offset="2326132">The breach of contract... we are talking about $40,000 in commissions claimed, sought damages only in the amount of $40,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.939" offset="2351732">The conversion, conspiracy, and breach of fiduciary duty claims, however, seek $150,000, and as is not surprising, the exemplary and punitive damage claim seeks $1.5 million, something that I believe is well beyond the reasonable ambit of either ancillary claims or simply different theories.</text>

            <text syncTime="1515.252" offset="6205003">Now, in enacting Labor Code Section 229, the California legislature in its wisdom felt that arbitration was less than an adequate remedy for redressing disputes over wages, and when this matter came before this Court in 1973, all eight Justices who participated saw clearly that California had a historical constitutional prerogative to protect its wage earners in this matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2430.893" offset="9867579">--Okay, but let me tell you how I think it would apply here, Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.111" offset="9888477">We have a situation where Mr. Thomas feels sorely aggrieved by not having received his wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.451" offset="9925780">As a side note you need not plead violation of Labor Code in bringing such an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.239" offset="9960993">You bring an action for denial of your wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.624" offset="9970501">And so I think that counsel has raised a red herring in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.195" offset="9988787">Now, if these appellants, these co-employees are acting in the course and scope of their employment in the course of denying my client his wages, then the only liability is on the member corporation, and quite obviously under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange then there would be some application there, but these are co-employees who have taken from him his money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.861" offset="10091501">They have allegedly taken his wages, and for them to claim that they are entitled to the benefit of the agreement doesn't follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.168" offset="10136640">Now, I have one more important issue that I wish to address and I believe that this is perhaps the most important issue we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.643" offset="10182616">And that is, is that the rules of the New York Stock Exchange which appellants are proferring here are simply unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.867" offset="10231517">Now, in Justice Marshall's decision for the Court in Byrd, noted in Footnote 2, the Court did not address that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.907" offset="10267670">It said that Byrd had not raised the adhesive nature of the contract in the court below and that this Court would not address it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.197" offset="10304764">We feel that the rules of the New York Stock Exchange are unfair in two regards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.018" offset="10328065">First, the arbitrator who is going to sit in judgment of this case and make a binding decision is appointed by the New York Stock Exchange of which appellants' corporation is a member firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.961" offset="10395879">We feel that there is an institutional bias, and it is not simply that the arbitrator would be unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.698" offset="10418763">We are not saying that the arbitrator would be fair... would be unfair, but as this Court has noted in many other contexts, it simply the appearance of unfairness that so offends constitutional notions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.791" offset="10479158">If the rules of the New York Stock Exchange was to use what we use in California such as retired judges, or the auspices of the American Arbitration Association, it would not be so offensive as the present rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.617" offset="10538508">Secondly, the rules of the New York Stock Exchange do not allow a meaningful opportunity for discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.307" offset="10569228">There is only one provision in there regarding discovery, and that says that the parties will exchange such documents as will expedite the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.995" offset="10604023">There is no judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.612" offset="10610501">Each side would have unfettered control over which documents would be divulged and which ones would not be, and this simply turns hundreds of years of judicial--</text>

            <text syncTime="2828.516" offset="11458123">I am pleased that his reliance on Ware has shrunk from 100 percent, where it was two years ago, now down to 80 percent, but I still don't think that that is the appropriate controlling authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.288" offset="11493127">Southland clearly is, and it fails unfortunately to this Court to tell the California Court of Appeals that it is, and it made no attempt to deal with it itself, and regrettably that is what brings us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.333" offset="11553313">I would like to turn to the last wage claim question as to whether or not it is egregious to contemplate that a wage claim would be resolved by arbitration or by any other mechanism other than judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.539" offset="11598139">The very Article I that 229 refers to includes Section 206, which specifically talks about a labor commissioner mechanism for the recovery of wage claims, which is indeed the most common way that wage claims are asserted in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.400" offset="11665639">The method is that the employee goes down to the labor commissioner, makes an assignment of the wage claim, fills out a form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.837" offset="11691344">The labor commissioner conducts a hearing within ten days, according to the statute, issues a ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.958" offset="11711824">You either... the employer either pays the wage claim at that point in time or can seek judicial review, so the State of California itself has provided an alternative mechanism for Mr. Thomas to recover the contended wages without resorting to the courts and without regard to an arbitration agreement.</text>
