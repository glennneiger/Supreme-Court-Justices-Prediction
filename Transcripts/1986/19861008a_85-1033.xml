            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="148542">Mr. Schuman, you may start whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carl J. Schuman</label>
            <text syncTime="64.989" offset="408408">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="67.458" offset="418335">The issue in this case is whether the Congress of the United States intended to allow a convicted criminal sentenced to make restitution to escape punishment by filing a petition of bankruptcy and listing the restitution order as a dischargeable debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.732" offset="479461">In broader terms, the issue is whether Congress intended the bankruptcy process to interfere with the orderly administration of criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.510" offset="514570">The state of Connecticut, the amici states supporting the state of Connecticut, the amici state and local organizations, submit that Congress had no such intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.789" offset="547693">We make this submission in light of the history and language of the Bankruptcy Code and the public policy purposes behind it.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.284" offset="577577">In July of 1980, the Respondent, Carolyn Robinson, pleaded guilty to larceny in the second degree as a result of her unlawful receipt of $9,932.95 in welfare benefits while she was simultaneously receiving social security benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.465" offset="654377">She was sentenced to one to three years in prison, execution suspended, placed on probation for five years, and ordered to make restitution at the rate of $100 per month over the five year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.100" offset="708921">She was to make her first payment in January of 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.753" offset="727520">In February of 1981, February 5th, only 20 days later, she filed a petition in Bankruptcy Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.407" offset="754165">State agencies did not file any exceptions to discharge and the Petitioner... the Respondent received a discharge in bankruptcy in May of 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.622" offset="798991">The Respondent filed an adversary complaint in Bankruptcy Court to determine the dischargeability of the restitution obligation when in February of 1984 state agencies took action to revoke the Respondent's probation as a result of her failure to make restitution payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.864" offset="871925">The bankruptcy and the district courts held that restitution is not a debt within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code and, in the alternative, that it was excepted from discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.939" offset="912258">The Second Circuit, however, reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.829" offset="923856">The Second Circuit's conclusion is at odds with, in the first place, the judicial history predating the Bankruptcy Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.966" offset="956353">This Court has followed the rule that if Congress intends to change a judicially created concept it will do so explicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.509" offset="994491">In 1978, at the time when Congress re-enacted the Bankruptcy Code, it had become judicially accepted that criminal monetary obligations were not debts subject to bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.128" offset="1053006">As early as 1848, in fact, this Court summarily affirmed a New York Court of Appeals decision holding that a criminal contempt fine was not a bankruptcy debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.372" offset="1097936">Subsequent to that decision and in part relying on it, at least six cases, both federal and state, have held or stated in clear terms that criminal monetary obligations, including restitution were not bankruptcy debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.399" offset="1162093">Now, contrary to the Respondent's position, these decisions did not turn on whether or not the debts were provable or allowable, but rather stated quite clearly that criminal monetary sanctions were not debts of any sort.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carl J. Schuman</label>
            <text syncTime="306.940" offset="1376297">--Because in those states in which the states have treated the restitution order as in part collectable similar to a civil judgment, they have just chosen different and perhaps innovative ways of enforcing their criminal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.496" offset="1434498">In a sense, in those states victims become private attorney generals that enforce their criminal statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.401" offset="1466054">But for purposes of the bankruptcy law, do you normally lock to the state law to determine whether something is a collectable debt?</text>

            <text syncTime="336.664" offset="1495102">--No, the question of whether it's a debt within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code is a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.069" offset="1520806">But in interpreting whether it is a debt or not I think it's relevant to say, it's as a matter of fact crucial to say, that a restitution order is punishment, not a debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.813" offset="1567722">Certainly the definition of a debt within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code must be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.482" offset="1590397">But even if you apply that definition in those states that force their restitution... or allow for enforcement of restitution by way of a civil judgment, restitution is still not a debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.947" offset="1640238">I'd like to explain why.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.117" offset="1648911">Restitution is an integral part of the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.287" offset="1669600">It allows judges the middle ground between jail on the high end and lesser forms of punishment on the lower.</text>

            <text syncTime="387.738" offset="1699484">Well, I just... if you look at the language of the statute, though, under the Bankruptcy Code, it becomes a little bit tricky, because it says a debt means liability on a claim, and a claim means a right to payment, whether or not it's reduced to judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.918" offset="1768134">So in a state that treats it as a right to payment on the part of the victim, it makes it more difficult to follow your argument, I suppose.</text>

            <text syncTime="415.742" offset="1811497">Well, even in those cases, Your Honor, that conclusion would mean that the victim would be the creditor in Bankruptcy Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.552" offset="1846710">I don't think it's conceivable to say that Congress intended that victims, who have already suffered enough for their crimes, would have to come into Bankruptcy Court in order to preserve a restitution order from being discharged.</text>

            <text syncTime="447.481" offset="1938452">--Yes, but we would submit that it makes no difference whether the state is the victim in terms of the ultimate outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.541" offset="1962694">If Your Honor is suggesting that the fact that a victim may have a right of civil enforcement in some states creates a right to payment, it would create a right to payment to the victim, and I don't think that Congress intended victims to have to come into Bankruptcy Court in order to preserve restitution orders from being dischargeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.297" offset="2041688">I would add that under federal law a fine, under the Criminal Fine Enforcement Act, can be enforced civilly, under a new 1984 federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.591" offset="2082857">Now, the fact that a criminal punishment can be enforced civilly does not somehow convert it into an ordinary civil debt, as would a breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.697" offset="2119324">A criminal fine surely is not a debt within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code, and restitution is not, merely because states may have chosen innovative ways to enforce a criminal sanction.</text>

            <text syncTime="524.654" offset="2247115">The real reason, if it is one, is that this was the first time this issue had arisen in Connecticut and state agencies were admittedly somewhat confused on how to handle it.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.727" offset="2291419">But our position is that the state... the Congress did not intend prosecutors to have to file exceptions in Bankruptcy Court, and so it would make no difference in our view whether we thought we should have or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1587.739" offset="6499432">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.438" offset="6534227">The question presented in this case is whether under the specific facts of this case the state was obligated to come into the Bankruptcy Court and file a complaint seeking a determination of non-dischargeability of this criminal restitution order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.759" offset="6607474">And if I may please, I would just like to address three factual matters before I continue with the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.179" offset="6633179">One is, there was a statement made about the amount of money that was being paid under the restitution order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.692" offset="6659301">The restitution order entered by the court was in the amount of $9,932.95.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.329" offset="6689812">That was the precise amount of the welfare overpayment that was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.514" offset="6714576">Although the order did say that it was to be paid at the rate of $100 per month, Your Honors will note that in the record on page 22A there is a reference in the letter that we received three years after the discharge that the state was now seeking to collect from the debtor a total at that point of $9,482.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.816" offset="6823768">So they were seeking really the full amount, less the amount she had paid up until that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.970" offset="6844353">And again, in the record at page 44A you will see in the complaint that was filed against the debtor for the revocation of the probation, again we have a figure of the balance owing at $9,382.95, again seeking the full amount of that restitution order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.432" offset="6922198">So it appears twice that the state was seeking the full amount as the compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1951.147" offset="7953094">That is to say, the creditor's judgment was related to a collection action on the one hand in the state court, and the question of whether the underlying transaction was one involving fraud was a different kind of issue which was, as this Court said, something that belonged within the exclusive province of the Bankruptcy Court as a result of those amendments in 1970 which required that certain kinds of non-dischargeable debts... and those are the ones under 523(a)(2), (4), and (6)... although they're non-dischargeable, must be brought into the Bankruptcy Court for a determination by the Bankruptcy Judge as to whether they are dischargeable or not under the meaning of those sections in the Bankruptcy Code.</text>

            <text syncTime="2261.695" offset="9195269">And as I understand the ruling in Beardon against Georgia, that fact alone ought not to be a basis for revoking their probation and bringing the person back in and re-instituting the sentence and the rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.111" offset="9248976">But if a good faith effort had been made to work to obtain money and so forth and wages to pay, that ought to be taken into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.141" offset="9281055">And so there's a concern in Beardon against Georgia about the poor person who is unable to pay the restitution order, and that really does dovetail into the Bankruptcy Code, because in the Bankruptcy Code we now have Section 707(b) that says that a regular bankruptcy may be dismissed by the Bankruptcy Judge if he finds that it would create a substantial abuse of that chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.302" offset="9373737">And that means that if somebody comes into bankruptcy and is able to pay on their bills, but is going to file a bankruptcy but has future income and can pay, that kind of a bankruptcy is subject to dismissal under 707(b) as a substantial abuse of that chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.594" offset="9430893">And if you then were to try and go into chapter 13 and file a wage-earner plan under chapter 13, that again is subject to a Section 1325(b) which says that that chapter 13 plan has got to include all of your disposable income over the next three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.493" offset="9502469">So there's a dovetailing of these provisions that forces somebody who is able to pay to have to pay if the debt fits within the ambit of those that might be a discharge debt in the bankruptcy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2353.065" offset="9560774">Mr. Dineen, as to those, as to those restitution orders that the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code don't happen to provide for... and you must admit, it seems to be sort of haphazard as to whether they will provide for them or not... it's not only a question of the judge when entering such a restitution order having to have in mind what the consequences will be, as you've describe them and as any creditor must do, although it seems strange to analogize a judge giving a sentence to a creditor.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carl J. Schuman</label>
            <text syncTime="3374.568" offset="13646743">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.115" offset="13652908">If Congress had intended to work a wholesale change in criminal justice whereby large groups of restitution orders in crimes such as negligent homicide, drugs, and, as I've pointed out, in other crimes, surely it would have been explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.828" offset="13715811">It was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.813" offset="13719781">Now, not only are there large categories of crimes in which restitution orders would be dischargeable without any remedy for the state, but there's a category of bankruptcy in which a debtor could escape other restitution orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.368" offset="13781953">If a debtor went into chapter 13 instead of chapter 7 as in this case, there would probably be no applicable exception to discharge for any sort of restitution order, because the only exceptions to discharge in chapter 13 pertain to long-term debts and alimony or child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.690" offset="13847259">There is no larceny exception to discharge in chapter 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.283" offset="13861574">So if this Court rules that restitution is dischargeable, then defendants ordered to pay restitution may just circumvent it by going into chapter 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.013" offset="13896578">The second point I would like to make is that the state believes that its inability or its possible inability to incarcerate a person who has... for failure to pay restitution when the restitution has been discharged, if this Court so rules, is an interpretation of Perez v. Campbell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.224" offset="13973378">Now, it may be possible that what the Perez Court really meant was that the debtor in bankruptcy gets a clean economic slate, but does not get a clean criminal record as a result of a bankruptcy discharge.</text>
