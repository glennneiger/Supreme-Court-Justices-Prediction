            <text syncTime="59.639" offset="381420">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question before the Court this morning is whether a state can require a recipient of AFDC benefits who receives a personal injury award to use at least a portion of that award for future living expenses in lieu of receiving AFDC benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.570" offset="481103">The question arises out of the enactment of an amendment to the Social Security Act by Congress in 1981 as a result of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act, and that statute is now commonly referred to as the lump sum rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.830" offset="542126">Essentially what that statute provides is that when a recipient of AFDC receives an amount of income in a month which when added together with all the other income available to that family in that month exceeds the state's standard of need, then the family must be disqualified from AFDC benefits for a period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.779" offset="629897">That period is determined by adding all that income together, dividing by the state's standard of need, and the resulting quotient is the number of months of disqualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.801" offset="670021">Congress in the statute uses the word "income" but does not define it.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.305" offset="696039">The Secretary, in enacting regulations in 1981 and '82 did not define the term but rather continued the long-standing federal policy of allowing states to treat personal injury rewards as income but did not require them to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.802" offset="778063">On March 18th of 1986 the Secretary enacted a rule which now defines lump sum income and requires states to include personal injury awards as income subject to the rule save to the extent that the funds are earmarked and used for a purpose for which they are intended, such as medical expenses or legal fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.840" offset="1218174">Whether or not this Court gives deference to the Secretary's determination, however, the petitioner believes that Virginia's inclusion of personal injury awards as income subject to the lump sum rule is a reasonable interpretation of the statute and is consistent with the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.634" offset="1293303">In Heckler v. Turner, this Court had before it a case involving a statute enacted by the OBRA Congress involving AFDC and the meaning of the word "income".</text>
            <text syncTime="300.292" offset="1343980">This Court looked at the language of the statute, its legislative history, the administrative background against which the OBRA Congress worked, and the goals and objectives sought to be achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.267" offset="1387866">In that case this Court determined that Congress did embark upon a new course which in that case was emphasizing work requirements over financial incentives.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.205" offset="1423601">We believe that if this Court examines the language of the lump sum statute, its legislative history, the goals and objectives sought to be achieved, and the administrative background against which the Congress worked, it will lead the Court to the conclusion that Congress indeed intended to embark upon a new course with the lump sum rule, and that Virginia has correctly identified that course.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.369" offset="1508343">Both Congress and the administration articulated a number of goals and objectives sought to be achieved by enactment of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.677" offset="1549512">They sought to restrain the growth of government spending.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.695" offset="1561632">They sought to redirect benefits to those who are without income or resources with which to support themselves, and to reduce or eliminate benefits for those who had money with which to support themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.853" offset="1614191">Congress and the administration sought to promote responsible budgeting and encourage personal responsibility, but of particular concern to both Congress and the administration was that the prior treatment of large sums of money had, in the words of the Senate Finance Committee,</text>
            <text syncTime="386.334" offset="1688170">"the perverse effect of encouraging recipients to spend money quickly in order to regain or retain eligibility. "</text>
            <text syncTime="393.170" offset="1715546">Prior to OBRA, a recipient who received a large sum of money could have been disqualified for the month that the money was received, but thereafter to the extent that any was left it was treated as a resource, and as soon as it was spent down to the state's allowable resource limit, then the person could immediately regain eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.667" offset="1805512">Inclusion of personal injury awards as income subject to the lump sum rule achieves every one of these goals and objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.809" offset="1846054">The funds remaining in the hands of a recipient after deduction for the directly related expenses by and large represents pain and suffering, loss of earnings, loss of earning capacity, and in some cases future medical expenses, but it is money.</text>

            <text syncTime="1328.083" offset="5455131">It is common ground among the parties that the statute does not define the term "income" and does not state either in specific terms or in general terms whether or not personal injury and worker's compensation awards should be treated as resources or income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.176" offset="5507481">Respondents have not been able to point to anything in the legislative history which shows that Congress intended to exclude these types of payments from the income calculation, and so what we have is a classic case of where Congress has created the general framework, mandated that the states shall take into account any income and resources, and then not define the term, left the interstices of the statute to be filled in by those who administer the statute, in this case the Secretary and the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.493" offset="5616777">In doing that, the Secretary, guided by what is left available to him, which is the purposes Congress was trying to promote, has on a case by case basis looked at the receipts that a family can receive and determined in his judgment whether or not those were the types of receipts that Congress intended to have included in the income calculation as to whether or not they would further the purposes of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1412.672" offset="5793469">In fact, the food stamp program is available to a broader group of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.743" offset="5813740">The AFDC statute is really designed as a statute of last resort, and I can give two reasons for that, at least two examples of why that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.516" offset="5848849">First of all, food stamps are in kind benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.550" offset="5860970">The only thing the recipient can do with them is get food with them, whereas the AFDC program is a cash grant statute, and Congress has defined the group of people eligible in the AFDC program more narrowly than the group of individuals eligible for food stamps in the food stamp program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.077" offset="5927112">In addition, as we pointed out in our brief, the food stamp program has a rather all-inclusive definition of income and then has an express exclusion for personal injury and worker's compensation awards, and that express exclusion is absent in the AFDC part of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.605" offset="5993254">The Court of Appeals gave three reasons for refusing to defer to the Secretary in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.210" offset="6031706">Its first reason was that it equated the concept of income with profit or gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.198" offset="6055634">It said that profit or gain is the plain and ordinary meaning of the term "income", and thus the Secretary has adopted an unreasonable interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.404" offset="6088444">We pointed out in our brief one can look at a variety of dictionary and sources, and we looked at the ones the respondents pointed out, and the term "income" is defined in various ways, profit or gain, gross receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.564" offset="6145077">In fact, in this Court's decision in Heckler versus Turner there are several references to the term "income" as being a broader concept than the narrower term "earned income", and in fact in several places refer to income as meaning gross receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.073" offset="6207144">The second reason the Court of Appeals gave for treating personal injury... for refusing to defer to the Secretary was that the Court of Appeals looked to other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.714" offset="6253642">The food stamp statute that Justice O'Connor has pointed out and the Internal Revenue Code, and in those statutes Congress has excluded by express provision personal injury or worker's compensation awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.105" offset="6303275">The Court might have looked at the SSI program where Congress has defined the term SSI program to include personal injury awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.316" offset="6368059">We just don't think that the interpretation of the AFDC program can be controlled by the decisions Congress has made in other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.772" offset="6405884">Rather, we have to look at the purposes and provisions of the AFDC statute, and as counsel for petitioner has noted and which I would briefly summarize, the purposes of the AFDC statute are promoted by treating worker's compensation and personal injury awards as income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.884" offset="6474325">Now, the final reason that the Court of Appeals gave for refusing to defer to the Secretary was, it found inequitable that the Secretary allowed the state to treat personal injury awards as income, and yet casualty losses as resources, and said that that violated the Secretary's own equitable treatment regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.679" offset="6553528">The Secretary has resisted that throughout the litigation, because since the Secretary gave the option to the states to treat personal injury awards or worker's compensation awards as either income or resources, the state was merely acting pursuant to an option that the Secretary gave the states, and the Secretary does not believe that when a state acts pursuant to an option given by the Secretary that the state can be violating the Secretary's own equitable treatment regulation at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.032" offset="6662929">Thus we would ask that the judgment of the court below be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.900" offset="6678393">Unless the Court has further questions.</text>
