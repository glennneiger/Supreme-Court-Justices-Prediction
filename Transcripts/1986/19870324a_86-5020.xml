            <text syncTime="76.231" offset="461146">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="78.916" offset="471909">The issue in this case is whether the State of Maryland may constitutionally execute a defendant based on a public opinion poll.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.272" offset="501270">This Court has repeatedly... most recently in this term in California versus Brown... said there are two relevant considerations in a capital sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.128" offset="536692">First, the defendant's background.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.011" offset="544216">Obviously that's not at issue in victim impact statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.163" offset="556859">The second thing are the circumstances of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.215" offset="569084">The circumstances of the crime, of course, in a normal way are also not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.518" offset="590296">There's no contention that the victims who testified were at the crime scene, were involved with the crime, but that the crime was instituted against them as opposed to the actual victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.493" offset="638152">The State, however, argues that this is still part of the circumstances of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.330" offset="665528">The argument really comes down to no more than saying,</text>
            <text syncTime="129.431" offset="673887">"If I cast a pebble into the ocean, the ripples just go on forever. "</text>
            <text syncTime="134.419" offset="693845">The problem with that, I think, is not only has it never been used as a basis for criminal sentencing, it's probably not even a good basis for tort law.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.359" offset="725610">The implications are simply staggering, because I think it's fair to say that each and every one of us is offended by violent crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.762" offset="755285">That being the case, there's no reason every citizen who is offended by this shouldn't come in and express that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.499" offset="778168">Indeed, we might have an 800 number linked up to the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.201" offset="793006">People could call in.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.503" offset="798230">More specifically, lawyers and judges who are involved in these cases are certainly offended by the facts that they have to deal with, the crime that they have to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.092" offset="832607">It would seem that it would be fair to call them in as also--</text>

            <text syncTime="242.890" offset="1127791">The crime does become more horrible, if it were not just the wife, if it were just a citizen that had to stand here and watch this.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.662" offset="1162795">So I think it is an aggravating circumstance of the crime, as opposed to someone who is not present at the crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="721.629" offset="3042671">And certainly there are opinions by Justices of this Court talking about retribution in capital punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="748.196" offset="3148937">It's difficult to think of anything that could better serve retribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.148" offset="3160745">Or if one doesn't like that, one could at least bound, gag and chain him during it.</text>

            <text syncTime="757.169" offset="3184882">The point is: Retribution has a legitimate basis, if one accepts it, in deciding whether or not we apply the ultimate punishment, but it doesn't help at all to say, "Is the procedure fair", because it would seem to me that the less fair the procedure, the greater retribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.312" offset="3245486">If one uses that argument, it militates in favor of having the most unfair procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1313.210" offset="5409052">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.912" offset="5419814">The issue in this case is whether victim impact evidence can be introduced at the sentencing phase of a capital case consistent with the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.601" offset="5450638">We believe that it can under Maryland's carefully devised capital sentencing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.153" offset="5472790">The Maryland General Assembly has chosen to include victim impact evidence in the death penalty process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.009" offset="5500271">In doing so, however, Maryland has not undermined the substantial safeguards of its process that guide the discretion of the sentencer and insure that the death penalty is not imposed in an arbitrary or capricious manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.467" offset="5554083">In fact, I suggest that Maryland's bifurcated death penalty procedure contains many more procedural safeguards than other sentencing procedures already approved by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.775" offset="5595252">Maryland has ten limited circumstances where the death penalty may be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.659" offset="5614792">With the exception of a person that contracts for murder, only a principal in the first degree, that is, one that actually commits the murder or kills the victim, is subject to capital punishment in Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.467" offset="5662021">The aggravated murderers, where the death penalty can be imposed, include such things as victim... as the victim was a law enforcement officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.973" offset="5692114">And let me stop here, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.008" offset="5700265">In Maryland, the defendant would not have to know that the victim was a law enforcement officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.496" offset="5722207">It would be sufficient that the... that the victim was a law enforcement officer on duty to constitute an aggravated circumstance under the Maryland Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.233" offset="5753136">Another... another example of the aggravated circumstances required by the Maryland Statute is that the victim was taken or attempted to be taken in the course of a kidnapping or abduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.123" offset="5796709">In this case, the aggravating circumstance is that the defendant committed the murder while committing robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.527" offset="5822309">Under Maryland's death penalty law, if no aggravating circumstance is found, then life imprisonment is the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.181" offset="5848954">However, if one or more aggravating circumstances are found to exist and the standard is beyond a reasonable doubt, then we shift to mitigating circumstances for consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.071" offset="5892526">In addition to Stat. 7, statutorily defined mitigating circumstances, Maryland also permits the defendant wide discretion to present other facts in mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.677" offset="5934949">Mitigating circumstances under the Maryland procedure must only be proved by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.998" offset="5960235">A single mitigating circumstance is sufficient under the Maryland procedure to outweigh whatever aggravating circumstances are found and indicate that life sentence is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.556" offset="5998374">In this case, the jury found and noted on the verdict sheet under the open-ended-other-facts category that the defendant's family environment, child neglect, and lack of strong father image were mitigating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.614" offset="6050619">I think this is important because it indicates that the jury was, in fact, listening to the evidence and understanding what the defendant was presenting.</text>

            <text syncTime="1542.274" offset="6325323">And it appears to me that the Victim Impact Law was, perhaps, passed later and is kind of an add-on, and that the form has never been adjusted to reflect how the jury is to use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.018" offset="6384255">And, indeed, in this case it was just the subject of argument by the Prosecutor, I suppose, after the Statement had been admitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2046.145" offset="8340722">I would like to say a few more words about the Maryland statutory scheme itself because I think once the Court understands the scheme and understands the safeguards built into the scheme, they will understand why the introduction of this evidence was not arbitrary or create an arbitrary or capricious result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.309" offset="8413447">Under the Maryland law, whenever the death penalty is imposed, the decision is subject to immediate review and direct review by the Maryland Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.228" offset="8445107">In addition, the trial Judge must submit a report to the Court of Appeals detailing information about the defendant, the conduct of the trial, and a recommendation by the trial Judge as to whether imposition of the sentence of death is justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.472" offset="8502054">Now let me say, the defendant has a choice in Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.107" offset="8512607">He can choose the jury or he can choose the trial judge at the sentencing phase of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.411" offset="8533819">And the jury's decision is binding if he chooses the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.563" offset="8550433">In reviewing the case, the Court of Appeals is specifically required under Maryland Statute to determine whether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.337" offset="8597558">In this case, the Court of Appeals concluded that the introduction of the victim impact evidence did not present an arbitrary factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.991" offset="8632144">As a final consideration, the Court of Appeals undertakes a proportionality review to determine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in a similar case, considering both the crime and the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.667" offset="8682821">It is, I suggest to you, in the face of this carefully devised statutory scheme, that Petitioner would have this Court rule that victim impact evidence cannot be introduced consistent with the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.607" offset="8726603">We submit to do so would be improper extension of the Eighth Amendment jurisprudence of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.611" offset="8750635">It has long been recognized that retribution is a valid rationale for the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.247" offset="8773205">In non-capital cases, it is typical in assessing a punishment to be imposed to consider the impact of the crime upon the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.853" offset="8807582">As Justice Marshall noted earlier, Maryland just suffered through a savings and loan crisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.674" offset="8826913">When we came to the point of sentencing the criminals involved in the savings and loan crisis, certainly the impact of their crimes on the State of Maryland was a relevant consideration and was appropriately taken into consideration by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.332" offset="8877486">And I don't think it offended the Eighth Amendment in any way, shape, or form to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.386" offset="8897757">Indeed, we recognize in our system of legal process, to paraphrase the words of Justice Stewart in Gregg, that channeling the instinct for retribution through the administration of criminal justice is essential in an ordered society that asks its citizens to rely upon legal processes rather than self-help to vindicate their wrongs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.382" offset="8985737">Consequently, it is entirely consistent with this long-recognized precept of criminal justice that Maryland provide the sentencer in capital cases with a victim impact information that can be used in considering what retribution should be exacted as a consequence of the defendant's conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.927" offset="9051879">Significantly the Maryland Court of Appeals in this case held that there is a reasonable nexus between the impact of the crime upon the victim's family and the facts and circumstances surrounding the crime, especially as I said before, as to the gravity or aggravating quality of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.072" offset="9124500">Thus, the Maryland Court appropriately gives deference to the Maryland statutory scheme and holds that victim impact evidence is admissible simply as another circumstance of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.363" offset="9169639">It is not, and let me emphasize this, indeed it cannot be, under the Maryland law, a call for the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.600" offset="9194612">This is not private vengeance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.719" offset="9207047">Instead, it simply provides additional probative information that the sentencer can use in weighing the aggravating nature of the crime against whatever mitigating circumstances it has found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.097" offset="9272562">The introduction of this victim impact evidence is not as Petitioner suggests "wholly arbitrary".</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.667" offset="9294818">Under the Maryland statutory scheme, it must be admitted in every case whether it is traumatic or inconsequential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.238" offset="9321149">In this regard, it is no more arbitrary than the crime itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2787.904" offset="11307814">I was speaking about the foreseeability of this, and let me just finally make my points on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.409" offset="11341878">Indeed, if you... if we accept the premise that the defendant knows or should have known that there's a family to be harmed when he commits the murder, then as the sentencer judges his moral capacity, it is called upon to recognize whether he felt any concern or remorse for the harm caused to the victim and the victim's family.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.609" offset="11434665">In this case, the evidence showed the defendant was particularly callous to the grave harm he caused others when he described to his cohorts that they should pay no mind to the brutally murdered bodies of Mr. and Mrs. Bronstein when they returned to the house to ransack and steal more property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.468" offset="11494015">He, obviously, was totally unconcerned that the Bronstein family would suffer greatly from his brutal acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.105" offset="11516585">He was simply concerned about taking their property without getting caught.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.640" offset="11534766">Nevertheless, I suggest to you that it was or should have been completely foreseeable to Booth, especially considering he lived two houses down the street, that the family would suffer greatly as a direct result of his conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.115" offset="11584607">Consequently, it is not at all unfair to require that the sentencer consider victim impact evidence in making a moral judgment regarding Booth's crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.875" offset="11647719">One other point that I want to respond to that the Petitioner has made is the emotional impact of this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.432" offset="11693904">Petitioner claims that victim impact evidence is so emotionally charged as to introduce an arbitrary factor that will disrupt the exercise of the guided discretion of the sentencer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.038" offset="11736327">Victim impact evidence may well be emotional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.073" offset="11748447">However, by itself, this should not be a problem of constitutional dimension.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.344" offset="11765584">First, the trial court can instruct the jury upon the use of victim impact evidence, although as I have said here, he was not requested to do so.</text>
