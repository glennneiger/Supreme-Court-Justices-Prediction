            <text syncTime="47.564" offset="344179">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="63.240" offset="406873">Last term in MacDonald, Sommer &amp; Frates versus County of Yolo, this Court found itself unable to reach the question of whether the just compensation guarantee is invoked when a local government regulation takes the use of private property, and it found itself unable to each that question because the California Court of Appeals had based its decision on two separate independent grounds:</text>
            <text syncTime="92.426" offset="523693">One, that no taking had been properly alleged in the complaint; and two, that even if one had been properly alleged in the complaint, that California law forbade just compensation as a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.317" offset="575206">This Court thus concluded that, since it could find that the independent holding that there was not a proper allegation of a taking was sufficient to justify the decision, it need not reach the compensation issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.445" offset="639781">This case is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.595" offset="648349">Here the California Court of Appeals dealt with only one issue, and it reached its conclusion for only one reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.003" offset="685966">And since that takes only one sentence, I'd like to reread it to the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="136.722" offset="700803">"We conclude that because the United States Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the question of whether a state may constitutionally limit the remedy for a taking to non-monetary relief, this court is obligated to follow Agins. "</text>
            <text syncTime="151.964" offset="761825">Of course, the Agins opinion which the Court of Appeals was referring to was the 1979 decision of the California Supreme Court which concluded that monetary damages in the form of just compensation are not available for a regulation which takes the use of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.878" offset="841446">Thus, adhering to the respect which this Court in MacDonald said must be paid to the decisions of the California Court of Appeals on matter of local law and local pleading, we would submit that the compensation issue which the Court was unable to reach in MacDonald is squarely before the Court in this case, because it's the only question of a federal nature that the California Court of Appeals dealt with and it's the only issue that was litigated on this question in the California courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="215.491" offset="1015944">They clearly analyzed the decision of the California Supreme Court in Agins in light of what had happened in this Court in its decisions since Agins, primarily the San Diego Gas &amp; Electric opinions, and concluded that this Court had not yet clearly enough indicated what its feelings were for California to reach a different conclusion, and therefore it found itself bound by the California--</text>

            <text syncTime="253.330" offset="1167246">In the reply brief, for example, we've collected all of post-Agins California decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.769" offset="1200996">The California Supreme Court twice since Agins has reiterated the rule that regulations cannot lead to just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.908" offset="1233597">The California Court of Appeals in a dozen or more cases in varying contexts has held that damages under just compensation cannot be awarded for a regulatory taking of property, and they've held that even in cases which were expressly brought as federal civil rights cases under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 in state courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2511.320" offset="10199239">Let me move to the point that I was trying to make before, which is why a mere allegation of denial of all use, even if it's accepted as a fact, not treated as a conclusion of law, even if it's accepted as a statement of fact by this Court, that doesn't state a taking claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.532" offset="10272068">And the reason it doesn't is from the very facts in this record some of which are in the trial transcript that's before the Court, some of which can be judicially noticed, we have a safety regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.423" offset="10315641">The rule of Mugler versus Kansas applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.625" offset="10328493">Under Mugler versus Kansas, a government has the right to prohibit a dangerous use of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.814" offset="10365169">And what the Court said 100 years ago in that case is that that is not a taking, it's not the kind of regulation for which the government must pay compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.205" offset="10410726">Mugler versus Kansas has been reiterated in other cases, in Goldblatt versus Town of Hempstead, and a recently as this Court's opinion in the Penn Central case and in Chief Justice Rehnquist's dissent in that case, where both the Court and the dissent agreed on one key point, and that is that when you're dealing with a regulation aimed at protecting the health and safety of the citizens you're dealing with a different animal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.407" offset="10539562">What you have there is an exception to the normal rule that a regulation which destroys property values can be regarded as a taking, because if all the government entity is doing is protecting the citizens from a dangerous use of land then it has not only the right to do that without paying compensation, but I submit the obligation to do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2641.985" offset="10721897">Now, we don't concede that, but if the Court wants to accept that as a general proposition, that it's bound by that conclusory allegation and this one in fact denies all use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.424" offset="10759618">The County's position is that use is dangerous, and the fact that a Mugler type regulation which prevents a dangerous use of land happens to deprive the property owner of all of his use does not provide an exception to the Mugler rule that compensation doesn't have to be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.386" offset="10835477">The bottom line question is does the County have to make a choice between allowing a dangerous use of land to be resumed or buy the land by paying compensation, because the only way to prevent a dangerous use of this land would be to put a permanent restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.466" offset="10911859">Then we've got a total taking, a permanent taking.</text>

            <text syncTime="3189.955" offset="12913779">The reason construction in flood plains is being restricted is that it's dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.961" offset="12941783">It's dangerous because it raises the flood level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.394" offset="12951500">It's dangerous because it causes a surge of water downstream, and when the building breaks up, as these buildings did... what more proof do we need than the actual events of this case... you've got tons of debris, in addition to all the backed up water, going downstream, damaging downstream property owners and taking lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.141" offset="13034570">The Federal Government has said that's dangerous and we've got to stop that, and so if you want federal assistance in getting flood insurance, you local governments have got to adopt regulations that restrict new construction in flood plains.</text>

            <text syncTime="3497.394" offset="14143520">We're talking about the Constitution and the vindication of rights under the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3506.666" offset="14180614">The question, as this Court has held on many occasions, is what is the impact of the governmental action on the private property owner?</text>
