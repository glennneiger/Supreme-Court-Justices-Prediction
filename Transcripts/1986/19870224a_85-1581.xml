            <text syncTime="12.308" offset="181753">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.774" offset="203591">The question presented in this case is whether the offenses committed by the petitioner, off base and off duty in Juno, Alaska, are subject to court martial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.737" offset="251447">The Court of Military Appeals decision in this case should be reversed for two reasons, which I'd like to discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.157" offset="285093">First, the facts of this case do not establish a service connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.217" offset="305364">Second, the Court of Military Appeals found that there was court martial jurisdiction in this case because it employed an erroneous and deficient service connection test.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.055" offset="348727">This Court has recognized that the special needs of the military justify a unique military justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.177" offset="385194">But it has also recognized that court martial jurisdiction should be limited to the least possible power adequate to the end proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.970" offset="424378">In this Court's O'Callahan and Relford decisions it has limited court martial jurisdiction by requiring that a service connection be established before a service member can be tried for civilian type offenses committed off base.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.261" offset="497521">This purpose of this service connection requirement is to balance the interests of the service member in the greater protections of a civilian trial against the military interest in trying the case at a court martial.</text>

            <text syncTime="134.946" offset="672228">But there were also indications of interest on the part of Alaska in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.054" offset="692708">In the record it indicated that Alaska was continuing to investigate allegations of charges against others daughters of civilians in the community there.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.252" offset="745475">And there was also a message from the Coast Guard that indicated that the State of Alaska had previously, and fairly recently previously, prosecuted Coast Guardsmen for similar offenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="172.790" offset="823634">The criteria that are relevant to the balancing test have been limited so that the infinite permutations of possibly relevant factors will not cause confusion about the proper limits of court martial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.970" offset="900329">And the outcome of the balancing tests depends on the facts in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.015" offset="924571">In this case there's no military interest that outweighs the petitioner's interest in the greater protections of a civilian trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.590" offset="962814">Now the limits on court martial jurisdiction are not based solely on the facts, the fact that court martials do not give service members all of the protections they would receive in a civilian trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.944" offset="1016313">The military justice system was created to serve a fundamentally different purpose than the purpose of civilian courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.283" offset="1049645">The military justice system is a tool for maintaining discipline in the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.249" offset="1073469">And another reason for limiting court martial jurisdiction is the historic disapproval of trying ordinary crimes at court martial.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.369" offset="1121952">I mean, O'Callahan, decided, what, '68, '69, was a departure from virtually a century of precedent.</text>

            <text syncTime="382.039" offset="1660597">Well, it was an extension, I believe, of some cases that had started to limit jurisdiction over people like military contractors and dependents.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.613" offset="1706990">The Court of Military Appeals did not apply this Court's Relford service connection analysis in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.593" offset="1746905">It totally ignored, or unjustifiable minimized petitioner's interest in the greater protections of a civilian trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.994" offset="1784417">But even so, if the Court of Military Appeals had applied the Relford criteria, it would have found that the service connection question here isn't even close.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.631" offset="1834990">The facts of this case simply do not show significant impact from these offenses on the Coast Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.487" offset="1866442">The petitioner in this case is an enlisted man in the Coast Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.595" offset="1886817">At a court martial convened at the Coast Guard base on Governor's Island, he was charged with 21 specifications alleging sexual molestation of four girls.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.979" offset="1940420">Fourteen of the specifications alleged offenses against two of the victims committed off base and off duty in Juno, Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.693" offset="1987232">These are the offenses that the trial judge dismissed for lack of a service connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.706" offset="2011265">The seven remaining specifications alleged offenses against two different victims on base at Governor's Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.860" offset="2043970">Jurisdiction over these offenses has never been contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.780" offset="2063614">All of the victims are the daughters of Coast Guardsmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.590" offset="2078869">The government has tried to establish a service connection in this case by asserting every imaginable impact on the Coast Guard that could possibly result from the effect of these offenses on the victims and their fathers.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.225" offset="2141354">Factually, however, the government was unable to prove any significant or direct impact on the Coast Guard at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.299" offset="2177717">As the trial judge properly found, any impact was remote or indirect, and any military interest in these offenses could be adequately vindicated in a civilian trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.465" offset="2230380">When make-weight arguments concerning nondispositive factors are stripped away from the Court of Military Appeals' decision, it's clear that it's based entirely on the dependent status of the victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.069" offset="2292760">The Court of Military Appeals did discuss two other factors that are unrelated to the dependent status of the victims, that is, the pendency of other court martial charges, and the difficulties that the State of Alaska might face in prosecuting the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.264" offset="2361514">These are simply make-weight arguments, however.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.418" offset="2374158">They have nothing to do with the impact of these offenses on the Coast Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.074" offset="2392757">And factors such as these are too easily manipulated and too far removed from the real interests that should be balanced to be helpful in setting clear limits on court martial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.318" offset="2445733">Because of the dependent status of the victims, the Court of Military Appeals also discussed the nature of the offenses and the age of the victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.532" offset="2494634">It found that these offenses made the fathers less effective and unwilling to serve with the petitioner in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.700" offset="2527235">From this it inferred that their units would suffer some less of morale.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.448" offset="2550327">This overstated and rather unlikely loss of morale is really the only direct... arguably direct impact on the Coast Guard that the Court of Military Appeals discussed.</text>

            <text syncTime="620.537" offset="2614589">Mr. Bruce, could you give me another example, the one that you would consider the closest, where a threshold question of whether the Court has jurisdiction over the matter is to be determined on the basis of, what do we have, 21 factors, and I assume that they're not exhausted?</text>
            <text syncTime="644.699" offset="2711242">Is there a comparable area of the law where we've gotten ourselves into that kind of a fix, that you don't even know what court is supposed to dispose of the matter until you engage in the kind of balancing test that you're talking about?</text>

            <text syncTime="663.020" offset="2784594">But that doesn't mean that there aren't others.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.582" offset="2798804">Another problem with this inference that... based on the impact of these offenses on the victims and the fathers, is that these kind of inferences can be drawn from any serious offense against a dependent victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.975" offset="2928371">Therefore, holding that these kind of factors are significant is tantamount to holding that the dependent status of the victim by itself is sufficient to establish a service connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.298" offset="2977691">But basically, whether or not the Court of Military Appeals' decision is viewed as resting entirely on the dependent status of the victims, or other factors, it should be reversed because it relied on an erroneous service connection test that did not require proof of a military interest, or that that military interest outweighed the petitioner's interest in a civilian trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1156.373" offset="4757988">First, if I may respond briefly to a question that Justice Blackmun raised during Commander Bruce's presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.977" offset="4808352">On page 57 of the Joint Appendix there is a stipulation that indicates that if the Coast Guard were to determine that the court martial were without jurisdiction to prosecute the Alaska offenses, the district attorney's office would reconsider its decision not to prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.065" offset="4876793">So that there's no sense in this case that the state has washed its hands of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.421" offset="4894138">It's simply waiting to see the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.577" offset="4902811">There are, we submit, no reasons to reconsider the O'Callahan and Relford cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.556" offset="4954742">There are three possibilities that might lead the Court, as a conceptual matter, to reconsider one of its prior decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.598" offset="4994866">One would be, for example, if it proved that the historic data on which an earlier decision had been predicated were incorrect or incomplete.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.063" offset="5036767">The government has pointed to nothing in this case that cast doubts on the historical materials that were presented earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.280" offset="5069576">And we know of nothing we can add to what was before the Court when O'Callahan was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.684" offset="5095176">A second factor that might lead the Court to reconsider a prior determination would be if the test had proved to be unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.213" offset="5125374">But that also is not the case with respect to the O'Callahan and Relford decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.523" offset="5142615">The O'Callahan and Relford decisions, though they've generated some decisions, some decisional law, in the military, and in the Article III courts, have not presented a substantial problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1597.742" offset="6523447">For example, how can it be... and I'm referring here to the notion of the nonbase base... how can it be that the less base the Coast Guard has in Juno, the greater the district commander's responsibility for his personnel?</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.659" offset="6587082">That's an irrational outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.532" offset="6602651">Or why should it make a difference to look, for example, at the danger to morale, why should it make a difference for purposes of military jurisdiction, whether or not the victim is a dependent of a member of the Coast Guard or a dependent of a member of the Navy?</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.635" offset="6663046">Many towns are both Navy towns and Coast Guard towns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.900" offset="6676107">Or why should it make a difference if the victim was a dependent of a member of the Coast Guard, but assigned to some other unit where the morale issue wouldn't take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.021" offset="6712574">And indeed, I'd like to draw the Court's attention to another point in the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.176" offset="6733158">There was testimony on page 101:</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.597" offset="6742876">Would the reputation of the Coast Guard be enhanced if the Coast Guard turned the individual who is charged over to the Alaska state authorities?</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.969" offset="6780388">And the answer from a government witness was, I think it would, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.686" offset="6795225">And that's the answer to the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.310" offset="6809749">If you have a concern that people in the Coast Guard are going to feel angry that their... let's call them shipmates, even though they work in a federal building... are going to escape punishment, that would be one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.524" offset="6866592">But there's no issue of that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.851" offset="6871921">What people, according to that witness, want, is they want to make sure that the Coast Guard is going to assist the local authorities who have primarily jurisdiction for law and order in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.940" offset="6920195">That's where these offenses in Juno took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.393" offset="6930017">And the only problem was that if somebody misled the district attorney in thinking there might be court martial jurisdiction here and that maybe he wouldn't have to prosecute this case, a disservice was done to that district attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.591" offset="6978814">And it's a disservice that's easily remedied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.232" offset="6989367">I would like to, if I have a moment, comment briefly on the Bouie and Marks issue, only to suggest that Solorio was deprived of two things of value by the decision of the Court of Military Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.068" offset="7052793">Number one, he was deprived of a complete defense to the court martial, because the Court of Military Appeals changed the rules on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.691" offset="7087274">Number two, because the U.S. and Alaska are separate sovereigns, the punishment is additive; it is cumulative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.985" offset="7120398">The consequence is that the net punishment for which Solorio was exposed... is exposed... has been increased on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.823" offset="7155820">And that is a black letter violation of ex post facto analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.103" offset="7172851">I would also comment that there's no notion here about reliance interests being frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.133" offset="7196989">Reliance plays no role, in our submission, on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.070" offset="7216737">Suppose, for example, an accused was ignorant... subjectively ignorant... of what the punishment was for a particular offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1996.202" offset="8117335">The argumentation by petitioner and amici have taken us far afield from this simple truth about this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.636" offset="8155056">Particularly, they make rather heavy weather of the Relford decision and its 21 criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.255" offset="8193508">And I think they miss the point about what Relford represented in the law when Relford came along after the shock to the system which O'Callahan represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.860" offset="8247947">Relford was decided two terms after O'Callahan, and performed the signal and the clarifying service of laying down a categorical per se rule: all offenses by service members on base, the serious offenses, are subject to court martial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.413" offset="8350138">So what you had there was a per se categorical rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.880" offset="8368006">That's the principal effect of Relford.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.504" offset="8382530">Now in order to justify and to explain that rule, and further to give guidance because the Relford Court said that that per se rule marked an area, perhaps not the limit, in order to give further guidance, the Court did lay dawn, in addition, 21 factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.697" offset="8479287">What petitioner and amici due is to overlook the fact that Relford laid down a categorical per se rule of the sort we seek here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.083" offset="8528816">And to suggest that each case requires the courts to solve a system of equations in 21 unknowns before they have jurisdiction, that it seems to me turns Relford on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.264" offset="8597570">We urge, first of all, that on its individual facts, and second, as a categorical matter, that this case and cases like it, which involve serious depradations against military defendants by members of the Armed Services be admitted within the limits set out by Relford, and that this be done by a per se rule such as Relford itself set out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.969" offset="8724316">First of all, it should be noted that in Relford the status of the victims as persons connected to the Armed Forces... there was a military defendant there... was specifically mentioned by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.884" offset="8788055">Second, it would be, we think, an anomaly to be concerned for the integrity of the topographical limits of the command, and to overlook the fact that the integrity of a command is after all an integrity of an organization of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.861" offset="8863914">But there is, as Justice Scalia has pointed during the petitioner's argument, the looming problem of off base drug offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.529" offset="8910621">This is not a drug case, to be sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.261" offset="8925563">But the issue is, has the Court of Military Appeals Trottier decision in 1980, which creates again a categorical rule for off base drug offenses, with very little exception, is that an improper understanding of this Court's jurisprudence?</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.143" offset="9013021">If it is, then the very successful approach to drug offenses which the military has had is cast in doubt by the kind of procedure, by this complex eschewing of any kind of categorical approach which the petitioners urge on the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.242" offset="9113436">Finally, we urge that the Court fulfill the work of Relford by returning the law to what it was when it was announced in such landmark decisions as Reid v. Covert, Toth v. Quarles, Kinsella against Singleton, and throughout the whole history of our Constitution, which is that service... that membership in the service was a sufficient condition for court martial jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2326.850" offset="9439862">Because it set down that per se categorical rule for all on base offenses by service members.</text>

            <text syncTime="2397.526" offset="9722611">But I don't know why it would affect it any more if I found out that, moreover the child that this officer or enlisted man molested, was a military child; not on the base... somewhere else.</text>

            <text syncTime="2428.609" offset="9846954">--It seems to me, Justice Scalia, to make an enormous difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.686" offset="9863255">Because we are talking about the esprit and the sense of comradeship which is supposed to obtain within the military services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.761" offset="9903483">So preying upon dependents of your fellow service members, in addition to being a pretty deplorable offense, is an offense to the relation of trust and comradeship which is supposed to obtain within the military services, and is an indispensable condition of the kind of morale and trust which is supposed to obtain among people who serve on ships together, whose lives depend on the exact performance of duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.512" offset="10042559">It seems to me that that comradeship is an important factor; not an irrelevance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.962" offset="10064293">And was so judge to be by the Court of Military Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2518.339" offset="10205877">It should be noted, and it's a matter of very great importance, that the O'Callahan decision, on its own terms, is by now at least obsolete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.195" offset="10253315">O'Callahan was tried... although the case was decided in the '59... '68 term, O'Callahan had been tried in 1956 under the 1950 Uniform Code of Military Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.515" offset="10314546">That Code has been twice revised since O'Callahan was tried, and important changes have occurred in 1969 and again, in 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.199" offset="10361253">The most important of these changes were, first of all, to remove, both organizationally and in terms of evaluation, the military judge and the defense counsel from the command and from the designation by them convening authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.438" offset="10462190">They no... the convening authority no longer picks the military judge, as he did in O'Callahan's time; no longer picks the defense counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2612.396" offset="10582040">However, the... what O'Callahan did indeed depend on was a description of the military justice system which simply is not a correct description of the military justice system as it now obtains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.952" offset="10660303">It may be, Justice Scalia, that if the rule we propose, which is the pre-O'Callahan rule, of status only, were to be reinstated, aspects of the military justice system would be subject to review, not on jurisdictional grounds, but on due process grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.269" offset="10761554">Indeed, the question of command influence, which has been very significantly address by both Congress and regulation since O'Callahan has been tried, are issues which have been brought to this Court, and which as recently as yesterday, the Court denied certiorari in cases raising that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.680" offset="10859251">So it's not as if the O'Callahan concerns might not be addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.211" offset="10877328">We suggest that they are not appropriately addressed in terms of a jurisdictional line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.223" offset="10905331">In fact, the very best example, the very best testimony for the current state of military justice, the independence and the zeal of the defense function, has been the defense of this case in the courts below and in this Court, both in the oral and written presentations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.446" offset="11010239">It seems to us that a system which nurtures such a system of advocacy against the extensions of its own authority cannot be fairly described, in Justice Douglass' mysterious term, as responding to the age-old manifest destiny of retributive justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.280" offset="11109609">It seems to me that we have seen exemplified here is a system of justice pure and simple, and that the congressional determination of what the jurisdiction of that system of justice is, the congressional determination and the determination of this Court, up until O'Callahan, should be the determination that spells the limit of when that system of justice has power over a member of the Armed Forces.</text>
