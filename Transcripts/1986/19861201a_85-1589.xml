            <label>Mr. Maxon R. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="70.566" offset="428032">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Court, we have today another Indian case from Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.859" offset="469201">The last time that you had an opportunity to hear a case from our jurisdiction was another Indian case, National Farmers Union Insurance Company versus the Crow Tribe of Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.946" offset="525521">That was way back in 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.461" offset="539627">At that time Justice Stevens, speaking for a unanimous Court, described the case as a kind of procedural nightmare.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.472" offset="575676">Of course, that was a Federal question case under Section 1331 of Title 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.079" offset="606083">In the intervening 12 or 13 months you have also had an opportunity to decide The Three Affiliated Tribes versus Wold case from North Dakota, which, of course, was a Public Law 280 case, and the interesting feature of that case was that it was kind of a jurisdictional yo-yo.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.135" offset="686331">You had it, I believe, two times, and now Iowa Mutual's case comes before this Court, a diversity case involving Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.054" offset="733978">It presents the problem of reconciling what we view as an unequivocal grant of Federal jurisdiction under Section 1332, constitutional in origin, reconciling that grant with the perceived limitations of Federal Indian policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.404" offset="811405">The solution suggested by the Ninth Circuit, go ask the tribal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.496" offset="839722">We do not feel that it is appropriate to go ask the tribal court the extent of your jurisdiction, nor is it necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.226" offset="874621">By placing this particular case, the one that we are arguing about this morning, in this limited historical context, I am simply trying to reinforce a conclusion that I guess I had been dealing with implicitly for the ten odd years that I have been practicing law in Montana, and that this case has served to crystallize, and the conclusion is this, quite simply.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.324" offset="991023">Federal Indian law as it exists primarily based on court decisions from this tribunal for the most part it doesn't work.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.081" offset="1066047">It is bad news for litigants like Iowa Mutual or National Farmers Union Insurance Company but it is also bad news for the reservation Indians to whom the Federal Government and certainly this Court has shown so much solicitude.</text>

            <label>Mr. Maxon R. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="248.183" offset="1138458">The good news, Justice Scalia, is that you have an opportunity to fix it, and I hope to... we can take some small steps today towards fixing it, and I guess the point I want to stress is that certainly in dealing with theory and with concepts like Federal preemption and the retained sovereignty of Indian tribes with which this Court grapples, it is necessary to keep in mind that we foot soldiers like Mr. Bottomly and I out in the trenches in Great Falls or wherever, in Browning, Montana, have to apply these concepts in a workable framework.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="286.496" stopTime="302.193">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="286.496" offset="1291745">Workable framework that you would be able to bring suit in Federal Court if you are an out of state insurance company, but if you are an in-state insurance company you can't bring suit in state court nor in Federal court, of course, because there is no diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.585" offset="1348065">Is that workable?</text>

            <label>Mr. Maxon R. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="302.193" offset="1354543">I don't think so, Justice, and the solution I hasten to characterize is that I stumbled upon and that I have ultimately reached and I have suggested in the reply brief that I have filed with this Court is that it is necessary to avoid these kinds of jurisdiction... these legalistic gymnastics, it is necessary to go back to the beginning and start rethinking these jurisdictional concepts and rework them, I think, from Williams versus Lee forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.898" offset="1481394">And the conclusion I reached, and it is one I find that certainly isn't foreclosed by any of the decisions from this Court, but certainly may have been assumed to be foreclosed, is that the tribal courts do not have jurisdiction over disputes between reservation members and outsiders, that that is not... it is a conclusion that I think everyone else has reached, that if a lawsuit involves a reservation Indian and some other party off the reservation, that state court jurisdiction is automatically foreclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.101" offset="1638128">And I look for the origin of that concept, and it is one that I had assumed existed, and you go back to the Williams case, to the Kennerly case, maybe the Santa Clara Pueblo versus Martinez case, and none of them say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.579" offset="1712107">I guess you have to keep in mind the facts of each particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.405" offset="1735408">Of course, the Williams case involved, I believe, either Mr. Williams or Mr. Lee was running a trading post on the Navajo reservation, and the other party had a bill they didn't pay, and the proprietor of that trading post wanted to collect it, and he went to Arizona state court, and he was told ultimately no, you proprietor of a trading post on the reservation, you have to go to the tribal court back in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.659" offset="1844391">And from that principle, which is... and I am not challenging the inherent equity or rightness of that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.016" offset="1873857">That the man who was operating the trading post on the reservation has to go to tribal court stems from this whole Indian jurisprudence that any civil litigation involving a reservation Indian must at least in the first instance go to tribal court.</text>

          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="447.620" stopTime="459.052">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="447.620" offset="1936238">Is there any line between this case and allowing the person who opens a trading post on an Indian reservation to sue in state courts?</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="469.315" offset="2022964">Even if the non-Indian... even in Williams, even if it were a case where the non-Indian is running a trading post on the reservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="478.297" offset="2058909">No, the line I would draw, Justice Scalia, is if it is between a reservation Indian on a reservation where Public Law 280 procedures have not been followed so that the state courts would have jurisdiction anyways, if we are dealing with that situation, such as on the Blackfeet Indian reservation in Montana, if it is a dispute between an Indian resident of that reservation and someone who resides off the reservation, outside the reservation, then no, the tribal court should not have jurisdiction over that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.517" offset="2203836">If it is a matter that, as Williams versus Lee, involved a dispute between a reservation member on the reservation and someone else who is residing or conducting a business that is located on that reservation, fine, and we haven't gone through the Public Law 280 formalities so the state-can assume jurisdiction over that dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.604" offset="2280218">That is where I would draw the line.</text>

            <text syncTime="736.806" offset="3092940">The National Farmers Crow Tribe case was an inquiry into the nature and extent of tribal court jurisdiction, and of course you ultimately said that was a Federal question and we do have the right to determine that.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.940" offset="3153544">It was the matter of how to go about doing that but you certainly haven't foreclosed the ultimate review by this tribunal, or go back, start in Judge Batton's court in Billings, and perhaps go back up the line again.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.342" offset="3207147">You said that is a Federal question, but we want to wait and see what you do with the tribal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.496" offset="3223761">I think that is greatly different from the situation we have here where we have come into Federal court, instituted an action that would appear to me fits all the parameters of the statute, and what the Court of Appeals has said is, first, you, comparable to National Farmers Union, will apply the same procedure, will go to the tribal court and let it determine whether it... I think the language used by the Court of Appeals is to see if the tribe would manifest any interest in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.809" offset="3381018">And in effect the tribal court is determining the Federal court's jurisdiction rather than the Federal court determining the tribal court's jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="931.760" offset="3872747">There doesn't seem to be any justification for it, and one can only go back to the rationale that the tribal court itself has espoused in this case, and that opinion and the underlying LaPlante versus Wellman and Iowa Mutual lawsuit appears in the joint appendix, and the tribal judge there went on at some length, he wrote a very lengthy opinion explaining why Iowa Mutual and Midland Claims, the adjusting firm, should not be dismissed from the case even though there was no bad faith insurance law in the Blackfeet Indian reservation or any comparable type of substantive law that would apply to the LaPlantes' claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.117" offset="4042229">The rationale espoused was that people like the Wellmans, Blackfeet Indians who reside on the reservation, do purchase Insurance and have an interest in having those disputes adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.097" offset="4090190">And therefore there is an interest in the Blackfeet tribal court system to have those type of disputes litigated in Blackfeet tribal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.421" offset="4135434">That is an invitation for general jurisdiction over just about any sort of claim.</text>

Williams case and I guess there is that ultimate question, to see... if, as I understand their rationale, If we ultimately determined that the Blackfeet tribal court doesn't have jurisdiction over this type of controversy, ipso facto the state court would be vested with jurisdiction perhaps and therefore the diversity jurisdiction would exist because we then get over the Woods versus Interstate Realty hurdle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.530" offset="4499895">As I have suggested, I think the more logical way over the Woods versus Interstate Realty hurdle, and I think this case does boil down as the government in its amicus brief suggested, it boils down to an Erie Railroad-Tompkins problem of reconciling this, is to redefine or I should say more precisely define the limits of tribal court jurisdiction, and if one does define those limits in the manner I have suggested, that internal tribal disputes, matters arising on the reservation between persons residing there go to tribal court, and matters between tribal members on the reservation and those persons, firms; or corporations located off the reservation don't belong in tribal court but rather in state or Federal court, depending upon the existence of diversity or such other matters such as a Federal question that would grant jurisdiction, then the Erie Railroad versus Tompkins problem and the woods versus Interstate Reality doorclosing type problem evaporates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1517.684" offset="6216453">I was trying to make that point with Justice Stevens, that the the Indian litigants, reservation members in Montana, any of the Indian reservations, I believe, have the right and have practiced it, and in my experience come into state district court, into federal district court and pursue their rights, it is a one-way street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.037" offset="6289909">We can't turn around or my clients as nonreservation members cannot go into state or federal court and as matters now sit pursue those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.219" offset="6326585">So that is how... I guess it is a one-way type operation, but the point that I want to leave you with is, I think it is ultimately to all the litigants' best interests that you redefine this jurisdiction, because I think that both the Indians and the non-Indian parties, citizens are ill-served by the present state of affairs, and it is one I can relate to in my own personal experience, because it happens to me and it happens to me on a frequent basis, that people come in and they want to talk to me about a prospective commercial or business dealing on the Indian reservations in Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.626" offset="6476215">My experience in dealing with Indians is not limited to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.828" offset="6493038">And my advice to them is comparable to the advice that many of my colleagues in Montana give to such persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.342" offset="6519160">Don't, because we can't help you, because we don't know what the rules are and the risks involved are too great.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.043" offset="6545909">You are going to be in tribal court if a dispute arises, and I can't advise you as to what your ultimate rights or remedies are, and the net effect is that all too often those types of commercial and social interactions are discouraged because of the uncertainty over the present state of affairs, and if we take this Court's admonitions or advice at face value in both Williams and in the Wold case, one of the rules of Federal Indian policy is to further the assimilation of reservation Indians into the mainstream of American life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.375" offset="6667222">The extension of tribal court jurisdiction I think almost by default ill serves that goal, and I think if commercial and social interaction is to be encouraged it will be much more encouraged if the jurisdictional lines are drawn as I have suggested this morning.</text>

            <text syncTime="2032.168" offset="8274380">Congress has shown this promotion by a number of statutes like the Indian Jurisdiction Act, the Indian Financing Act, the Indian Self-Determination and Education Act, all of which takes lets the tribes take the lead in developing their own policy and implementing, and have offered some measure of protection by the Indian Civil Rights Act which requires the consent of the tribes before the states can take jurisdiction over actions which arise on the reservation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2796.196" offset="11330497">Kennerly might indicate and the Fisher cases might indicate that there are some types of issues which are so intrinsically bound up into tribal issues that the state court or the federal court wouldn't take jurisdiction, but in this case--</text>

            <text syncTime="2809.440" offset="11383474">But the springing use, to use the Chief Justice's phrase, for federal jurisdiction would depend on either of two things, one, that the tribal court had no jurisdiction, or secondly, it declined to exercise it as a matter of discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2821.325" offset="11431016">--Yes, that is at least what the Three Affiliated Tribes case tells me, that if the tribal court doesn't exercise its jurisdiction in that area, there isn't interference with the tribal court to bring it in state or federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.196" offset="11486501">Even if we assume there is technical diversity jurisdiction, National Farmers Union versus Crow Tribe seems to tell us that we should defer to the tribal court at least in the first instance to determine the issues and its own jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.158" offset="11546373">Now, Iowa Mutual hasn't directly attacked the tribal court's jurisdiction in this action, although they have in another action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.185" offset="11578452">That issue, as Iowa Mutual admits in its brief, is bound up because if the Federal District Court takes the issue it has got to to do one of two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.401" offset="11619307">It has either got to take the issue away from the tribal court and in that case undermine its authority by taking the issue away, or it has got to create a risk of conflicting adjudications between the federal court and the tribal court, and that would also tend to undermine the authority of the tribal court because there would be some difficulty in enforcing the judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2898.217" offset="11738634">And also to accept diversity jurisdiction would undermine the lawmaking authority of the tribe because you apply state law, unlike state courts, but there is nothing in the statute itself or the surrounding circumstances that say Congress intended that to be so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.445" offset="11819509">They have been uniformly silent with regard to their intent on the diversity statute, and the implication from silence can be seen in many cases by this Court, and that is that when Congress is silent the tribal sovereignty or the tribal jurisdiction remains intact, as it said in Merrion versus Jicarilla Apache Tribe.</text>

            <text syncTime="2938.735" offset="11900698">But of course that was tribal sovereignty as opposed to a state, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.871" offset="11929224">You are in little bit different ball park when you are talking about tribal sovereignty versus a federal court that has also received a grant of jurisdiction from Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2954.868" offset="11965273">That's true, but Santa Clara Pueblo versus Martinez tells us that even when there is a statute which talks about Indian civil rights in that case, that federal courts will hesitate to imply an action there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.002" offset="12041759">That was a declaratory action for equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.377" offset="12051268">And that they will hold back unless it is clear that Congress intended it to be so, but citizenship has never been a factor or criteria by which the extent of sovereignty or the abrogation of sovereignty of tribes has been judged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.073" offset="12114066">In fact, in U.S. versus Neece, which was an early case, 1916, that involved U.S. citizenship earlier than the 1924 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.990" offset="12153668">The Court said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.037" offset="12157952">"Citizenship doesn't abrogate the unique relationship between the tribes and the federal government which give rise to the rules of statutory construction involving tribal court jurisdiction. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.782" offset="12212914">Further evidence of Congress's lack of intent to circumvent the tribal court through diversity is, of course, the conflict of laws problem which we discussed and the equal protection problems between the citizen of Montana and the citizen of another state that we talked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.291" offset="12286892">And finally, of course, while it is not binding on this Court, it should be noted that the basis of the petitioner's writ of certiorari, that is, the conflict between the Eighth and Ninth Circuit, has evaporated if not completely, to a great extent because the Eighth Circuit subsequent to the grant of writ of certiorari has adopted the Ninth Circuit's reasoning in R.J. Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.436" offset="12387516">That is, the interference doctrine limiting courts, non-Indian courts from intruding on tribal jurisdiction, applies to both federal courts and state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.542" offset="12431924">And so there does not appear to be a conflict there as there was at least when this cert was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.959" offset="12457629">That is all I have.</text>

            <text syncTime="3177.632" offset="12856257">About Mr. Bottomly's suggestion that Congress does not want actions like this one brought in state court, I disagree wholeheartedly with that because I think Public Law 280 exists and this Court has recognized Public Law 280 as a procedure, as an expression of Congress's desire that such actions be assumed by state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.105" offset="12958135">In Kennerly this Court admonished the states that the formalities of Public Law 280 have to be adhered to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.165" offset="12990422">However, it didn't abrogate Public Law 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.086" offset="13002125">That exists as an expression that the states should ultimately assume jurisdiction over all matter of actions that otherwise would be within the jurisdiction of the tribal courts, and to respond particularly to Justice Scalia's comment, Public Law 280 does not define the nature or extent of that tribal court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.064" offset="13070043">It merely says for those types of actions the states can do this to assume it, but it hasn't said that Williams versus Lee is an appropriate expression of tribal court jurisdiction or what the Ninth Circuit views it to be in this case or anyone else's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.651" offset="13124378">My understanding of what Public Law 280, it can easily be reconciled to the proposition which I have advanced this morning that for those limited matters the procedure exists for the states to assume jurisdiction over them, but ipso facto it does not mean that all these other matters that in this gray area where tribal courts have assumed jurisdiction by default that those can do so.</text>
