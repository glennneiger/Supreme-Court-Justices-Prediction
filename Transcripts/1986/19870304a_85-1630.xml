            <text syncTime="43.499" offset="322868">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="46.562" offset="335093">The issue in this case, simply stated, is whether a civil rights claimant who wins nothing in the course of his lawsuit is entitled to attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.307" offset="370097">The answer simply is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.150" offset="377411">The facts of this case are as follows, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.775" offset="387965">Aaron Helms, a state prisoner, was found guilty of prison misconduct as a result of his involvement in a prison riot.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.960" offset="416699">In a Section 1983 action brought against state corrections officials, Helms challenged this finding of guilt which had been based on information supplied by a confidential informant on due process grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.237" offset="465810">Helms sought equitable relief and money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.594" offset="479184">While the action was pending in the district court, Helms was paroled from prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.733" offset="495798">The district court entered summary judgment for the state officials and the Third Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.934" offset="520562">The circuit court remanded the case to the district court to determine the issue of petitioner's claim of official immunity, and also to determine the appropriateness and availability of the relief requested by Helms.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.398" offset="570404">On remand Helms abandoned any claims other than his request for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.161" offset="589525">The district court granted judgement for the officials, finding them to be immune from liability for damages, and the court of appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.500" offset="626828">Helms then petitioned for attorney's fees which the district court denied, finding that Helms had not prevailed in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.905" offset="656503">The court of appeals reversed and awarded fees, concluding that its statement of the law on prison informants in its first opinion was sufficient to qualify Helms as a prevailing party under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.227" offset="713764">In addition, the court of appeals directed the district court to determine whether Helms' suit was a catalyst for a state regulation addressing the use of informant testimony which was passed, or promulgated after judgment had been entered for the officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.644" offset="771442">There are two major reasons, Your Honors, why a plaintiff like Helms should not be entitled to attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.624" offset="795370">First of all, to award attorney's fees to a claimant who has obtained no personal benefit or no actual relief as a result of his suit would violate both the plain meaning of the statute, as well as the intent of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="199.190" offset="945627">No judgment, Your Honor; there was a remand at that time to the court of appeals to consider--</text>

            <text syncTime="853.964" offset="3564663">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="864.210" offset="3605728">The civil rights attorney's fee provision and other fee award statutes enacted by Congress provide for the award of attorney's fees to prevailing parties as an incident of litigation in which those parties succeed on the merits of their claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.856" offset="3696216">These statutes are not intended to exalt attorneys' fees into a self-generating force that will drive the merits litigation or transform the nature of the merits litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.586" offset="3751178">That is the basic theme of the brief that we have filed, and we believe a fundamental principle reflected in this Court's decisions under the attorneys' fees statutes, and preservation of that principle requires in our view insistence that the statutory term "prevailing party" be given meaningful and manageable content.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.699" offset="3867684">To be a prevailing party, the plaintiff must receive some practical relief or benefit for himself on the merits of his claim, whether by judgment, by settlement, by consent decree or by voluntary action taken by the defendant, and here the respondent did not receive any such benefit or relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.673" offset="3967576">His damages claims were held barred by immunity, and he failed to pursue any of his equitable claims presumably because they were moot since he was no longer in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.933" offset="4020552">Now, it is true that the court of appeals said on his first appeal that his rights had been violated but it did not rule on whether he was entitled to any relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.834" offset="4076141">This Court's decisions make clear that a litigant is not automatically entitled to equitable relief, whether declaratory relief or injunctive relief, merely because a court agrees with his contention on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.952" offset="4140611">A judgment in his favor may nonetheless be precluded by mootness, by lack of standing, by case of controversy limitations, by equitable considerations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1031.579" offset="4275194">That would then bring in the criteria that this Court talked about in Hensley against Eckerhart of whether he prevailed on a substantial part of what he was seeking.</text>

            <text syncTime="1044.717" offset="4327752">What he got from the court of appeals ultimately was no different than if the district court in the first place had rejected his claim on grounds of immunity and mootness and the court of appeals had merely affirmed that but citing dictum about, you know, if they weren't barred by mootness and immunity we think he would indeed have a meritorious claim and his rights were violated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1531.656" offset="6275442">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.011" offset="6332912">The case before you today is one dealing with statutory construction, and in the process of statutory construction there are several things to look at, among which are the statute itself and the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.911" offset="6392471">Obviously from the discussion that's gone on this morning, we are well aware that there is nothing in the statute itself that is going to answer the question before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.706" offset="6427684">However, we feel there is strong language in the legislative history to indicate that the Third Circuit's decision was correct, and I will attempt to address that language today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.497" offset="6470838">There are three basic focuses in the language of the legislative history as to when we decide to shift attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.916" offset="6508454">Those three focuses are the vindication of rights, constitutional or statutory; when an individual functions as a private attorney general, enforcing congressional policies; and third, when the person has effectively secured compliance with the federal or constitutional laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.738" offset="6579821">Where these policies have been furthered, Congress has made the decision that we shift the burden or the costs of establishing that violation from the person who was subject to the violation to the violator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.434" offset="6638544">That is the pure and simple language we believe is involved in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.088" offset="6657143">As to the issue of the vindication of rights, this language is repeated constantly throughout the legislative history and it is repeated, not to be too picayune about this but at least nine times within the language of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.628" offset="6727361">Significantly, what is not contained in the legislative history are concepts of personal benefit and formal relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.342" offset="6762260">One of the issues with regard to the vindication of constitutional rights is the concept and the expressed language of the fact that when an individual succeeds on an important matter in the course of litigation, that is a point at which Congress as decided it is proper to shift the costs--</text>

            <text syncTime="1703.781" offset="6963925">Obviously the concept of "prevailing party" is the concept that all the courts have been struggling over, so the word "prevailing" does not have a finite definition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1871.049" offset="7633078">In other words, they didn't decide because someone was awarded damages that you shift the costs over.</text>

            <text syncTime="2479.583" offset="10067168">There is nothing in the legislative history that indicates that they contemplated formal relief and judgments, and I think one of the most significant cases in the legislative history is the case of Richards versus Griffith Rubber.</text>

            <text syncTime="2512.634" offset="10199348">She could not receive any relief because the employer was only doing it solely to comply with the state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.975" offset="10224739">The state regulation subsequently changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.458" offset="10234665">Despite the fact that there was no relief, despite the fact that the only thing that occurred in that situation was a finding of a violation of the statute, the court awarded attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.814" offset="10276148">One of the reasons I think this case is significant is that it is a fairly obscure district court case out of Oregon that they cited for this proposition, so they must have picked it for a reason and that's why we think that's an important case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3191.432" offset="12914619">And I think this Court addressed that in Pulliam versus Allen and one of the cases that this Court noted in Pulliam versus Allen is the case of Pierson versus Ray.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.272" offset="12953908">That case specifically dealt not only with absolute judicial immunity but it also dealt with the lesser concept of qualified immunity and presumably if it implies that attorneys' fees can be awarded for declaratory relief in the case of absolute judicial immunity, it also applies in the case of qualified immunity and I would... if you stand this case up against every purpose as expressed in the legislative history, the vindication of rights, the functioning as a private attorney general and the bringing of the State's action into compliance with the law, the facts of this case indicate that every single one of those policies was vindicated and furthered by this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.564" offset="13139063">Therefore, I think this is especially a case within which Congress intended the shifting of attorneys' fees and I would say that if the opposition does not agree with the concept the place to go, as this Court noted in Pulliam, is not to the Supreme Court of the United States but to Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="3315.210" offset="13409692">He got no damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.460" offset="13414708">He got no injunction and he got no declaratory judgment or declaratory relief, and I think we need to be clear that what he got from the Third Circuit Court of Appeals was not relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.003" offset="13460892">The court said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.191" offset="13465594">"We therefore leave the issue of official immunity to the district court on remand. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.765" offset="13483880">But it also said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.218" offset="13489731">"Further proceedings will also be required to determine the appropriateness and the availability of the requested relief. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.121" offset="13517316">In other words, they gave him no relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.183" offset="13533617">They didn't come close to giving him relief, and they made it clear that if the man's going to get relief on his claims which are damages, injunction and a declaratory judgment that's going to be done by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.070" offset="13577085">You also need to understand, Your Honors, that shortly after Helms filed his suit he was parole from prison.</text>
