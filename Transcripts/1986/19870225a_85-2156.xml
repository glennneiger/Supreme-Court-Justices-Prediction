            <text syncTime="18.556" offset="225335">This case presents the issue, whether a complaint that alleges racially motivated discrimination and harassment against Jews may state a claim under Title 42 of the United States Code, Section 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.446" offset="292835">The complaint alleged that respondents' desecration of the synagogue of Shaare Tefila Congregation was racially motivated and hence covered by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.594" offset="341423">The complaint further alleged that the facts that supported the allegation of racial motivation were principally the character, symbols and words that respondents themselves painted on the synagogue.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.855" offset="402549">The complaint alleged that they painted the words,</text>
            <text syncTime="67.019" offset="419163">"Dead Jew, Death to the Jew. "</text>
            <text syncTime="70.381" offset="432643">They painted swastikas, and on a door the words,</text>
            <text syncTime="74.292" offset="448211">"In, Take a Shower, Jew. "</text>
            <text syncTime="76.532" offset="457198">They painted the garbled German words, "Toten Kamf Verband" next to a skull and crossbones.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.989" offset="487082">The "Toten Kamf Verband" with the death head units of concentration camp guards in Nazi Germany, and the skull and crossbones was their symbol.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.655" offset="529714">These words and symbols invoked Nazi ideology, and it was one of the principal tenets of Nazi ideology, both in Nazi Germany in the 1930s and '40s and among neo-Nazi groups in this country today that Jews are racially non-white and inferior to whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.900" offset="622709">The complaint further alleged that respondents painted the words, "Ku Klux Kian", and the burning cross, the familiar symbol of the Kian.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.567" offset="661371">Kian groups, like the Nazis, hold as one of their central tenets that Jews are racially distinct from whites and inferior.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.173" offset="703794">The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals split on the issue as to whether this conduct stated a Section 1982 claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.563" offset="749351">A majority affirmed the dismissal of the complaint, holding that because Jews are not racially distinct or non-white, this conduct does not state a 1982 claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.509" offset="801178">But in dissent, Judge Wilkinson recognized that although Jews are not racially distinct from whites, when they suffer racially motivated deprivation of rights protected by the statute, they like any other group should be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.610" offset="869514">We, of course, agree that Jews are not racially distinct from whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.115" offset="887591">We respectfully ask this Court to reverse the Fourth Circuit and to hold, consistent with its prior cases--</text>

            <text syncTime="261.705" offset="1197926">I am reminded, in answering your question, of Justice Marshall's language in the McDonald case, that at the time of the passage of the statute in 1866, Congress probably didn't anticipate racial discrimination against whites of the sort that this Court held in McDonald to be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.697" offset="1269919">But Congress had an open-ended concept of what it was covering, that there would be new groups coming to this country; new kinds of discrimination undoubtedly would arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.632" offset="1309625">And it was the discrimination itself that Congress focused on, not particular groups and whether they were covered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1667.487" offset="6821044">We believe that the error of the Fourth Circuit simply was in not applying this Court's precedents in McDonald and General Building Contractors, but adding on that extra burden an extra test for the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.210" offset="6891888">One of the additional difficulties with that test is that it simply is not practicable and sensible for the district courts to be trying to figure out who is racially distinct or non-white, which are the words the Fourth Circuit used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.240" offset="6956045">It is unclear, first of all, what the Court even meant by "racially distinct".</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.954" offset="6978928">Racially distinct from whom?</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.766" offset="6990109">In Sullivan and Tillman, this Court held that even whites who are the victims of racial discrimination by other whites, because those white plaintiffs have advocated the rights of blacks, have a cause of action under Sections 1981 and 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.678" offset="7061789">And we believe, again, the principle that underlies that case is if the motivation is racial, it's racial because those white plaintiffs were advocating the rights of blacks, that once again there should be a cause of action even if the plaintiffs and defendants are of the same race, indisputably.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.378" offset="7128558">In terms, of course, of its language about the Jewish plaintiffs in Shaare Tefila being non-white, we think perhaps it goes without saying that it would be completely inappropriate exercise for the district courts to undertake trying to figure out who is white and non-white in some objective, anthropological or scientific test, that that simply would not be an appropriate approach for the courts to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.569" offset="7253423">For all of these reasons we respectfully ask this Court to reverse and to hold that all victims of racially motivated deprivations of the rights enumerated in the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 may state a cause of action under Sections 1981 and 1982.</text>

            <text syncTime="1826.453" offset="7456865">I would argue that inclusion of such a religious discrimination claim within the scope of this race discrimination statute is entirely out of keeping with the purpose of the statute as originally enacted and its specific language as interpreted by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3487.885" offset="14102625">I think it's quite conceivable that Hispanics would be a group that is commonly identified as non-white in our society.</text>

            <text syncTime="3518.732" offset="14226027">--I think that those groups would be included within the categories that are protected because in many instances individuals that are in those groups have dark skin, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.429" offset="14268763">And there can be no doubt that if an individual is discriminated against because he is black and has dark skin, or a large number of members of that group are black and have dark skin, they would have a cause of action under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.707" offset="14317874">In conclusion, I would like to say that where, as here, there are adequate state remedies available to the petitioners, it is not necessary to stretch Section 1982 to cover every defendant's... every defendant who is motivated by an irrational and erroneous racial perception, and therefore I would ask the lower courts to uphold... this Court to uphold the lower courts' dismissal of this claim for the desecration of a synagogue under Section 1982.</text>

            <text syncTime="3588.528" offset="14505224">May it please the Court, if I could just briefly address the issue that arose during Mrs. Garren's argument about commonness of the perception of Jews and whether this is a deviant belief, first of all, as Judge Wilkinson pointed out in dissent below, there was no record on the commonness of the belief because we were cut off on a Motion to Dismiss in which the district court didn't even consider the extra pleading material that we put in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.399" offset="14628731">But secondly, that I think that some Gallup poll or test of the prevalence of the view really doesn't solve the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.026" offset="14667183">The facts of this case show that this kind of conduct occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.817" offset="14686409">It is not unique to Shaare Tefila, and where it occurs, regardless of the prevalence or whether we characterize it as deviant, which I hope we all would, that the harm is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.466" offset="14728936">It is a harm based on racially motivated conduct and it should be redressed under Section 1982.</text>
