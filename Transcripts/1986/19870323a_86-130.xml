            <text syncTime="12.058" offset="198556">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Frank Rock died on July 2nd, 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.829" offset="233664">Vickie Rock maintains that his death was caused by the accidental discharge of a Saturday night special pistol which fired when her husband grabbed her hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.185" offset="271072">He was attempting to prevent her from leaving the house to get a hamburger.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.303" offset="287581">The pistol was in her hand, she maintains, because her husband had become suddenly violent striking her and slamming her into a wall.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.576" offset="320600">She thought it would keep him from hitting her again.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.278" offset="331467">Vickie Rock went through the trauma of a fruitless wait for the ambulance she called and watching for the police while they began their investigation while her husband lay dying on the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.586" offset="380682">She was taken to jail before the ambulance arrived to pick up her unconscious husband and she learned of his death in a jail cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.506" offset="408371">The evidence is that only Frank Rock and Vickie Rock were in the room when the gun discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.643" offset="428956">Frank Rock made no statement to the police before his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.762" offset="441390">Almost a year later on June 25th, 1984, Vickie Rock was arraigned on a charge of manslaughter in the death of her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.701" offset="477126">Three months after her arraignment, Vickie Rock was still unable to recall some of the detail of the events that occurred between the time her husband slammed her against the wall and the time she went to the telephone to call for the ambulance, a matter of seconds.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.163" offset="542954">Such amnesia is apparently not unusual for persons involved in violent confrontations but in her case it was not complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.399" offset="571898">She remembered a great deal of detail from both before the gun discharged and after.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.720" offset="593214">The record does not reflect what other methods were used by her lawyer to attempt to refresh her recollection of those violent moments.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.624" offset="620799">But he finally employed a professional psychologist for the purpose of trying to refresh her memory with the use of hypnosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.480" offset="648280">After two sessions with the psychologist she was able to recall much of what she knew but had forgotten.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.634" offset="676910">The most important thing she was able to remember was that she never pulled the trigger.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.571" offset="700629">That in fact, her finger was outside the trigger guard when the pistol discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.441" offset="724139">This revelation enabled her lawyer to employ an expert gunsmith, who after extensive testing of the weapon was able to testify that the pistol not only could but was quite likely to discharge in the manner related by petitioner, something that had previously been thought to be impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.153" offset="790908">As the case stood at this point a clear and probably close jury question was presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.557" offset="820584">Did the gun discharge by accident in defect in design, or was it fired by petitioner in the course of a scuffle?</text>
            <text syncTime="177.282" offset="859454">Believing Vickie Rock's testimony the jury could have acquitted her.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.817" offset="881606">Disbelieving her they had almost no alternative but to convict.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.320" offset="903653">The jury though never had the opportunity to make that choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.207" offset="923193">Vickie Rock's testimony about what happened in those few seconds was suppressed by a pre-trial order which limited her testimony about those events to what she had told her psychologist prior to the first hypnotic session.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.384" offset="979826">That order, more than any other ruling, took the decision away from the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1601.932" offset="6558014">The answer to that question, I submit to this Court is yes, and further that the state of Arkansas can properly fashion its own rules of evidence if they do not violate fundamental constitutional safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.906" offset="6605975">And the Arkansas rule does not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1643.725" offset="6725197">The Arkansas Supreme Court in reviewing this testimony had it applied the Frye test for instance, in terms of generally accepted by the scientific community as a procedure that is advanced as being legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.833" offset="6769710">Said if you'd applied the Frye test under the testimony submitted with the experts of Orrin and Diamond and others would not have admitted this testimony because it was not generally accepted by a scientific community as being reliable and credible.</text>

            <text syncTime="3107.058" offset="12578611">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.546" offset="12600554">I'm not at all enough familiar with the process to say unequivocally what hypnosis is in the sense that I can testify to it from personal experience, but I know that from the point of view of looking at it from the legal process that I see little difference in that process and the process of a lawyer going over and over and over a story with the witness, which any good lawyer does, in preparation for trial so he'll be able to withstand cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.283" offset="12735450">I'm not even sure that I can see the difference if the witness listened to his own story on tape at night while he's asleep.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.539" offset="12764499">The ultimate issue, I think, here is that jury question issue and that is whether this case is going to stand as the first case in recent legal history where a defendant in a criminal case who was an eyewitness to the alleged crime was not allowed to tell the jury what happened according to her own present waking memory.</text>

            <text syncTime="3178.155" offset="12862928">Mr. Luffman, that's not unthinkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.940" offset="12870138">Let me quote you from Nix v. Whiteside where we said that until the latter part of the preceding century criminal defendants in this country as at common law, were considered to be disqualified from giving sworn testimony at their own trial, by reason of their interest as a party to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.918" offset="12945997">So until the 1900s your client wouldn't have been able to testify at all in many states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.091" offset="12978703">And that was not considered to violate the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.793" offset="12989465">Now, this is a close question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.245" offset="12999287">Even if we hold that you now have to let defendants as a matter of constitutional law, although you didn't in the 1800s, even though you have to let them testify, how can we go so far as to say that this close call must go in one way rather than another given the history of testimony by defendants?</text>

            <text syncTime="3236.360" offset="13095731">I think the answer is a combination of two cases, first Nix v. Whiteside as I understand it says that certainly the right to testify is now a Fourteenth Amendment right.</text>

            <text syncTime="3250.120" offset="13150797">And I would apply to that, you know, to that question the Chambers reasoning that where the state evidentiary rules or, even though there may be good reason for them, when they are applied in such a way so that a criminal defendant does not have that fundamental right of fairness to tell his story to the jury then due process is violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.001" offset="13254347">Because two things, number one, the inherent value on allowing an individual accused of a crime to tell his story and number two, the traditional function as between the judge and the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.995" offset="13306278">And that determination of reliability and inherent worth of the testimony is historically and traditionally the function of the jury and I think properly so.</text>
