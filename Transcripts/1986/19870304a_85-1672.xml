            <label>Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="12.886" offset="202199">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.042" offset="214843">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.772" offset="233755">The issues in this case stem from the March 3, 1981 search of respondent's farmhouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.692" offset="257370">That search was carried out under the authority granted not by a search warrant but by a consent-to-search clause in the judgment of probation and due to the respondent's sentencing proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.204" offset="295404">That proceeding followed respondent's convictions on two firearms charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.734" offset="313586">And that sentence, as we now know, was stayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.889" offset="326229">The stay led to the second proceeding that was involved in this case, the February 27, 1981 hearing, that came on the prosecutor's motion for clarification or modification of the original order of a stay entered by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.680" offset="385370">At that hearing, respondent's counsel was present, and he had been notified.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.850" offset="406059">Respondent, however, had not been notified of the hearing, and he was not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.894" offset="422255">At the hearing, which was very brief, the state municipal court stated that it would grant the motion for clarification and that the conditions of probation were reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.375" offset="464155">The search of respondent's farmhouse was carried out four days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.202" offset="479411">During the search, the members of the team discovered a large cache of firearms and ammunition, and a narcotics laboratory.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.808" offset="509817">After respondent was prosecuted in federal court on several narcotics charges, he moved to suppress the evidence seized in the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.477" offset="540537">The district court denied the suppression motion for two, independent reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.038" offset="558823">First, the district court concluded that respondent was on probation at the time of the search, and that the search was lawful under the consent to search clause in his judgment of probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.534" offset="596753">Second, and in any event, the district court concluded that the members of the search team, and indeed, even respondent's own attorney, all held a reasonable and good faith belief that they were authorized to conduct a search by virtue of the February 27 order entered by the municipal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.980" offset="662582">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.432" offset="676374">At the outset, the court concluded that respondent was not, in fact, on probation at the time of the search, because the original sentence had been stayed in its entirety, and not just to period of confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.506" offset="716707">The court then went on to address the order entered at the February 27 hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.894" offset="734262">The Ninth Circuit held that the order entered at that proceeding, and its terms, was a nullity because respondent was not personally notified about the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.219" offset="767489">The Court of Appeals, after entering that ruling, went on to address the government's argument that the good faith exception that this Court adopted in Leon should be applicable to this type of search.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.528" offset="804792">The Court of Appeals concluded that it should not, because it believes that the offices could not have had an objectively reasonable belief that this was a search related to probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.665" offset="841259">In the Court of Appeals view, this was a subterfuge for a criminal investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.601" offset="857037">The Court of Appeals granted our petition, which presented both the notice and the good faith questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.144" offset="883159">Respondent has sought to defend the judgment below on an additional grounds, namely--</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="187.659" stopTime="191.126">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="187.659" offset="901236">You mean, this Court granted your petition, not the Court of Appeals?</text>

          <turn speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="191.126" stopTime="228.002">

            <text syncTime="191.126" offset="915133">--Oh, if I misspoke, I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.376" offset="920149">This Court granted the petition limited to those two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.860" offset="930075">And respondent has sought to defend the judgment below on the additional ground that the February 27 hearing was invalid because he wasn't present.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.607" offset="961109">Now, there are several different ways this Court could resolve the issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.887" offset="978141">Technically speaking, if this Court were to disagree with the Ninth Circuit insofar as the Ninth Circuit held personal notice of a hearing is required, this Court could reverse the judgment below on that ground alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.804" offset="1025893">However, the Court could also, we believe, decide the case solely on the good faith grounds that the Court of Appeals rested its decision in part on.</text>

          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="228.002" stopTime="242.904">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="228.002" offset="1062673">Don't we have to get to the good faith ground anyway?</text>
            <text syncTime="230.814" offset="1073853">I don't understand how the Court of Appeals felt it had to do both of those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.186" offset="1099349">If it wasn't a good faith probation search, it didn't matter whether he was on probation or not.</text>

          <turn speaker="paul_j_larkin_jr" startTime="242.904" stopTime="277.061">
            <label>Mr. Paul J. Larkin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="242.904" offset="1122232">Well, the Court of Appeals analysis in that part of its opinion contained several different elements, we believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.526" offset="1144697">The Court started out its analysis by talking about whether the officers could have reasonably relied on the February 27 order.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.914" offset="1174268">And it ended up its analysis by saying that the good faith exception should not apply because this is the type of conduct we want to deter.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.911" offset="1202271">But in between the Court of Appeals added in two additional elements into its consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.861" offset="1222124">The Court of Appeals seemed to say that this was an invalid probation search because it went beyond the scope of the authority that a police officer has.</text>

            <text syncTime="278.513" offset="1264652">If... if it was a pretextual search, wouldn't it be unnecessary to reach the other issues?</text>
            <text syncTime="283.668" offset="1285341">Or would it still be necessary to reach some of the others?</text>

            <text syncTime="290.635" offset="1313135">I mean, as a real world matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.149" offset="1323270">If you find that it was a pretextual search, wouldn't that be an end of the case?</text>

            <text syncTime="317.751" offset="1421595">Insofar as this case goes, given that assumption, if this Court were to find that it was pretextual, I believe you would be right; that would end it.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.545" offset="1452838">But there is no basis in fact or in law for the Court of Appeals' conclusion that this was a pretextual search.</text>

            <text syncTime="349.865" offset="1550118">The reason is, here, for example, if respondent... if there was reasonable cause to believe that he had violated some of the law, then it perhaps would be possible to conduct a probation search on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.171" offset="1599333">The Court of Appeals seemed to be adding into the calculus on this part of the issue certain factors that are just wrong under California law that's clearly established; and it also seemed to be making a factual finding that's inconsistent with what the district court found.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.839" offset="1657951">The district court found that the police officers and the prosecutor had an objectively reasonable and a subjectively reasonable good faith belief that this was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.646" offset="1697239">The Court of Appeals seemed to say that because there were certain elements not present in this type of search that it believed should be present, it couldn't have been a probation search.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.095" offset="1730990">The Court of Appeals pointed to the fact that he hadn't been assigned a probation officer, but that's irrelevant under California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.969" offset="1754500">A police officer doesn't need the authorization of a probation officer to carry out a search of this type, and a probation officer doesn't need to accompany a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.684" offset="1789399">In addition, the facts under California law that a probation officer has not been assigned to a probationer doesn't invalidate the judgment of probation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1192.265" offset="4919705">Now, it's our view that the officers, as I said, had an objectively reasonable belief that the consent to search clause imposed in respondent's November 14 judgment of probation authorized a search in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.460" offset="4984488">These types of conditions are not unique to this type of proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.333" offset="5007999">They're well established in California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.208" offset="5015417">For nearly a decade prior to the search in this case, consent to search conditions had been helf to be valid both as legitimate conditions of probation and as lawful under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.892" offset="5062229">California Supreme Court expressly addressed the validity under the Fourth Amendment of these types of conditions in the Mason case in 1971, and between the date of that case and the date of the search in this case, neither the California Supreme Court nor any lower California court said that these were disfavored sources of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.320" offset="5135894">In these circumstances, we believe that the principles that the Court discussed in Leon are fully applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.615" offset="5169122">In our view, the two central principles on which the Court decision there rested were, first, that the purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter police misconduct; and second, that the exclusionary rule cannot serve that purpose where the officers act in an objectively reasonable belief that their conduct is lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.655" offset="5237249">It's also our belief that the officers will not be... should not be required to draw distinctions among the different types of authority that they are given, between the authority granted by a statute or the authority granted by a search warrant or the authority granted by consent to search clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.507" offset="5304645">But even if we're wrong in that, and even if there should be some type of distinctions police officers should be required to make, it would be unreasonable to demand that a police officer distinguish between the types of authority that a judge gives him to search, between a search warrant and a consent to search clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.860" offset="5370056">And that's particularly true in this case, where there had been... a substantial number of years had intervened, showing that this type of condition was lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.826" offset="5405896">Now respondents and amici have argued that the reasonable mistake exception should not apply to this type of authority for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.727" offset="5441527">We believe those contentions are unpersuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.086" offset="5450931">Respondent and amici first argue that the decision in Leon rested on the proposition of encouraging the police officers to secure warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.473" offset="5484577">In our view, that misreads the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.566" offset="5492936">The decision in Leon, we believe, rested on the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule in different contexts, and not on the question whether or not the police should be required to resort to warrants, because that's a question of substantive Fourth Amendment law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.671" offset="5545285">Respondent argues that it's too difficult to determine whether a police officer acted in good faith in this context, to decide whether or not the good faith exception should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.041" offset="5582797">And we believe he's greatly overstated the difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.260" offset="5591679">The orders are presumptively valid, and a police officer can be required to know of any intervening developments in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.195" offset="5615398">In this case there were none.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.617" offset="5621145">The decision on which the Court of Appeals relied to rule that respondent was not on probation from the outset was handed down after the search in this case; and therefore, no member of the search team can reasonably be deemed to have been aware of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.644" offset="5669210">Respondent and amici also argue that there are already exceptions to the warrant requirement that authorizes reasonable police conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.405" offset="5704214">In our view, that misfocuses the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.764" offset="5713723">If as we believe Leon rested on a deterrent rationale, then a police officer will not be deterred from engaging in objectively reasonable conduct, with or without a warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1751.042" offset="7154846">Under the law of the State of California, there must be reasonable belief that a person is in violation of a condition of probation, and the alleged violations that were brought to the court in this case all occurred prior to February 27th, prior to the date of that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.927" offset="7226317">There was never any allegation that there was any violation of probation or any terms thereof during the term of probation, which in this case, assuming the best for the government, is between February 27, and the date of the search, March 3rd.</text>
