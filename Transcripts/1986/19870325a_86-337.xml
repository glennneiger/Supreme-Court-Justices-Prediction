            <label>Ms. Betty Jo Christian</label>
            <text syncTime="10.106" offset="196181">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.491" offset="209765">This case involves the interpretation of Section 306 of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.163" offset="248426">This Act was passed by Congress in response to a major financial crisis in the railroad industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.935" offset="275489">In addition to providing an immediate infusion of federal funds, the Act took the first steps toward deregulation at the federal level and placed restrictions on the powers of the states with respect to the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.010" offset="331809">In Section 306, Congress declared state tax discrimination against railroads to be an undue burden on interstate commerce and in an express exception to the Tax Injunction Act, granted the federal courts jurisdiction to remedy any violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.205" offset="400668">The key substantive provision is Section 306(1), which appears at page 20-A to the Appendix to the Petition for Certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.798" offset="451032">Subsection 1 declares that it is unlawful for the states to engage in any of a series of prohibited acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.135" offset="484364">Subsection A and B are directed to the assessment of railroad property at a percentage of that property's true market value which is higher than the percentage of assessed value to true market value of other commercial and industrial property.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.664" offset="550401">Subsection C is directed to and prohibits tax rights which are higher for railroads than for non-railroad property and subsection D prohibits any other tax which results in discriminatory treatment of a railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.141" offset="620410">The specific issue in this case is whether Section 306 gives the federal courts jurisdiction over a claim of tax discrimination resulting from the overvaluation of a railroad's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.933" offset="671505">In its complaint in this case, Burlington Northern alleged that in 1982 the state of Oklahoma had over-valued its property.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.741" offset="710793">And that as a result of that overvaluation, its property had been assessed at a percentage of assessed value to true market value which was higher than the percentage of assessed value to true market value for other commercial and industrial property.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.868" offset="783309">The District Court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.654" offset="798460">The 10th Circuit, relying on its own prior decision in the Lennen case upheld the dismissal of the complaint, holding that generally Section 306 does not grant the federal courts jurisdiction over state tax discrimination which results from overvaluation of a railroad's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.234" offset="880694">It carved out one exception holding that the federal courts would have jurisdiction if the railroad could make a strong showing prior to trial of purposeful overvaluation with discriminatory intent and upheld the District Court's conclusion that Burlington Northern's affidavits have failed to make such a showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.064" offset="960001">The same issue has been considered by two other Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.266" offset="972854">Both the 8th Circuit and the 9th Circuit have held that Section 306 grants the federal courts jurisdiction over all claims of state tax discrimination, specifically including discrimination resulting from the overvaluation of a railroad's property and that no showing of discriminatory intent is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.464" offset="1065641">Before I turn to the text of the statute I believe it is important to emphasize one point and that is that it is clear from the reports of Congress that its goal in enacting this statute was to put an end to state tax discrimination against railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.658" offset="1134395">As a practical matter, discrimination can result just as readily from the overvaluation of the railroad's property as it can from undervaluation of other commercial and industrial property or from higher tax rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.483" offset="1193745">Thus if Section 306 does not encompass discrimination which results from overvaluation of the railroad's property the statute will be left with a gaping hole and will not accomplish its purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="406.930" offset="1783486">The only way that the District Court can determine whether that requirement has been met is to make a determination as to what is the assessed value and what is the true market value of both railroad property and other commercial and industrial property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1368.691" offset="5630591">The 10th Circuit invented its intentional discrimination test in order to solve what it perceived to be a problem with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.880" offset="5667267">The problem it perceived was that letting federal courts inquire into the true market value of railroad property would unduly interfere with state taxing prerogatives and would burden the federal courts, both by increasing their work load and by requiring them to undertake difficult or inappropriate tasks.</text>

            <text syncTime="1415.655" offset="5818464">In fact, Section 306 is a limited measure that Congress carefully designed to avoid intruding on state tax prerogatives to the greatest possible extent consistent with achieving the objective of eradicating discrimination against railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.867" offset="5887218">First of all, Congress enacted a three year delay in the effective date of the statute to avoid any kind of shock effect on the states and to give them plenty of time to bring their law into compliance with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.459" offset="5949598">Secondly, Congress adopted in the statute the state's rules governing burden of proof as to true market value and that means the railroad is going to have to shoulder whatever difficulties are inherent in proving true market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.886" offset="6011352">Thirdly, the statue only bars discriminatory overvaluation of railroad property.</text>

            <text syncTime="2064.742" offset="8414721">The federal district court dismissed this case finding after reviewing affidavits and interrogatories and depositions submitted by the railroad and the state that the only dispute was over the value that the state was placing on the railroad's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.502" offset="8473758">The 10th Circuit affirmed that ruling holding that Section 306 of the 4-R Act which clearly gives the federal district court the authority to equalize assessment ratios and tax rates that are being applied to railroad property does not give a federal court the right to revalue the railroad's property and become what the 10th Circuit has previously referred to as state assessment boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.550" offset="8573964">It is our contention that Congress, in fact, never did intend for a federal court to become a state assessment board, a fact that is supported by the language of the Act and by its legislative history.</text>
