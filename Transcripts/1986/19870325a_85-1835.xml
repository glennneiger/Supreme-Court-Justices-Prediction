            <text syncTime="3314.572" offset="13410997">Well, if it were not in a bag, what if he just threw the betting tickets in the container as he went by?</text>

            <text syncTime="3322.760" offset="13443807">--Yes, if he threw them in the containers, and someone could... a policeman come by, because if a neighbor came by and saw it, not much would happen unless the neighbor wanted to take it to the police, and if they did, then of course the police may use that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.949" offset="13484558">If a policeman came by for whatever reason, perhaps he's in an area where he has a right to be, and he looks in the trash and he sees it, we have many cases like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.805" offset="13519980">Clearly, yes, then he has a right to seize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.591" offset="13531160">But when all we know is that it's in a opaque bag and it's in the bottom of the trash, I don't see why we take his Fourth Amendment right away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.613" offset="13563238">He has done something to indicate a desire for privacy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3361.318" offset="13598033">But he does that when he creeps out into the park at night and tries to hide it under a bush in the park.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.789" offset="13619872">And a policeman can surely come around and take it from under the bush.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.158" offset="13633351">The mere fact that he wants to keep it secret is not equivalent with a Fourth Amendment right.</text>

            <text syncTime="3375.895" offset="13656339">But what we're doing here is indicating not that we want to keep it secret... if I used that term, then I apologize, and I should have said, he's evidenced an expectation of privacy in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3414.453" offset="13810566">I mean, we were... we were just talking about your general privacy in garbage argument, which is different from your curtilage argument?</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur Lewis</label>
            <text syncTime="3422.441" offset="13842540">I can't extend the privacy argument to the placing of trash in a public park on or under a bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.328" offset="13866050">I can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.313" offset="13870020">These are somewhat related, and I think that's why they've got to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.517" offset="13890814">I objected to the petitioners trying to say that this is an abandonment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.719" offset="13907637">I submit it's a curtilage case as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.087" offset="13917145">If we go through the rest of the items in Dunn, it's the nature of the use to which the area is put.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.658" offset="13947343">And I submit, household trash, storing it and taking it to the trash man, is that sort of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.097" offset="13973152">Then of course this Court pointed out, the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observations by people passing by.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.584" offset="14007111">And I submit that the size of the trash container, where it was, there's nothing in the record to indicate that what he put there was visible without it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.357" offset="14042220">But I would close with this final statement that we find in Dunn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.428" offset="14058520">As Professor Amsterdam has observed, the question is not whether you or I must draw the blinds before we commit a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.247" offset="14089762">It is whether you and I must discipline ourselves to draw the blinds everytime we enter a room under pain of surveillance if we do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.537" offset="14122886">And that's the sort of thing I would hate to see the country come to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.091" offset="14141171">I had a number of other items.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.226" offset="14157681">Yes, the closing that I would like to leave you with was the objection by one of the amici to this Court was that if you couldn't decide it on the issue of abandonment and curtilage, that you ought to decide it on the basis of Leon, and that is, that there's a good faith belief on the part of the officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.257" offset="14257782">And that somewhat struck me as being a last gasp sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.328" offset="14278053">Because in California, Krivda's been the law for some 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.530" offset="14298847">And why policemen are still going through the trash is somewhat of a mystery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.034" offset="14316923">I would point out to this Court that almost every year, ever since Krivda, we still have policeman taking the trash, getting the trash truck, and going through it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.307" offset="14357988">This argument is fought all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.259" offset="14365825">There is obviously not a response to what it is that the courts are saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.246" offset="14389753">And I'm asking this Court to send another message, that if there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in one's items, that it has got to be respected.</text>
