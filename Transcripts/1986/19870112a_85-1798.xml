            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="150394">Now, that concept must stop short of private litigants who merely ask the state courts for relief win at trial and then ask that the judgments in their favor be duly recorded, because if the state action concept reached that far then every state court proceeding would automatically become a target for a federal injunction and the 1983 exception would then utterly swallow the anti-injunction rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3.868" offset="165858">And indeed, quite apart from the impact on the Anti-Injunction Act, if the state action concept engulfed all who invoked judicial process and, with the help of court functionaries, record the judgments that they win, the distinction between private and public action so fundamental to this Court's jurisprudence would be obliterated.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.048" offset="250495">Now, Texaco I think sees the threat here, but it says there's no problem because Pennzoil is not like an ordinary private plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.006" offset="298352">Why not?</text>
            <text syncTime="38.875" offset="305875">Well, the reason, you see, is that the state of Texas abdicated to Pennzoil what they call a judicially unsupervised power to control disputed property and to decide whether Texaco will have to post full security to stay the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.587" offset="384660">That theory about Texas law is a complete fantasy.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.656" offset="409006">It was not even adopted by the Second Circuit, which was content to observe that in order to enforce its judgment Pennzoil would, as a judgment winner must in every state, act together with various functionaries in getting the judgment recorded and in the process of execution.</text>

            <text syncTime="87.422" offset="500017">Mr. Tribe, let me ask you where this goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.074" offset="514645">If we go along with you and assume that the private party who's reducing the judgment to effect a collection is not a state actor, what about these functionaries who are assisting him?</text>
            <text syncTime="105.150" offset="570965">Are they state actors?</text>
            <text syncTime="106.269" offset="575458">Is the problem here simply that the wrong party was sued and that you could have sued someone else in federal court in Massachusetts and achieved this result?</text>

            <text syncTime="117.158" offset="618926">Whoever they sued, I think there is a more fundamental problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.327" offset="631674">It's not just who you denominate as the actor, it's the concept of state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.397" offset="651945">The mere identification of functionaries would not solve the problem, because one could then always sidetrack a state proceeding by identifying the clerk with whom a complaint was filed or some other functionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.674" offset="717042">The real question is whether there is any problematic state action that can be adjudicated in this particular lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.846" offset="745777">Of course, they didn't sue--</text>

            <text syncTime="150.479" offset="752255">So you're not saying... your basic argument is not that this is not a state actor, but that there is no state action here?</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="156.383" offset="775870">--Well, in the background of the case, in enacting its laws Texas acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.585" offset="792693">But that was true also in Flagg Brothers, and it's always true.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.787" offset="805441">We're saying that no state action is properly challenged in this lawsuit, not that the state of Texas has never acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.274" offset="839400">Indeed, the government of Texas acted in a four and a half month trial to adjudicate the liability between these parties, and in doing so it rendered a judgment that is final and claim preclusive under Texas law.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.485" offset="900317">It is that fact, the adjudication of that judgment, which is simply recorded in the form of a lien if the lien statute comes into operation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.841" offset="945666">They try to present the picture that somehow Pennzoil is the repository of an abdication of state responsibility, that the courts of Texas are somehow not supervising the power Pennzoil is wielding, and that it is for this reason that the 1983 exception suddenly opens the door to a federal flanking maneuver that otherwise would be unavailable.</text>

            <text syncTime="255.980" offset="1174290">[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="257.297" offset="1179514">Great care was taken to distinguish the case of an ex parte pre-judgment attachment where the state was abdicating power to a private party.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.104" offset="1226743">There is all the difference in the world between allowing private parties to go around deciding, let's see, we'll seize this oil company or we'll take that asset, and simply enforcing a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.912" offset="1270002">And with respect to the lien statute, all that's being done, it's like recording a mortgage, or in an example Justice Stevens once gave, recording a car transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.768" offset="1309395">It's simply recording your place in line.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.986" offset="1322247">Now, there is of course also the bond provision but the bond provision does not delegate power to Pennzoil.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.159" offset="1359027">If anything, it delegates some power to Texaco.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.278" offset="1371462">That is, if they can post a full bond then automatically they're entitled to stay the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.764" offset="1393405">It also leaves power in the hands of the courts of Texas, quite obviously.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.101" offset="1414721">The trial court in this very case entered a stay unsecured preventing any enforcement action for a full three and a half months, as paragraph 7 of the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.261" offset="1475429">And if Texaco had bothered to ask for an extended standstill, if they wanted to have an unsecured judgment for a longer time, it would be not Texaco, but the courts of Texas, that would decide whether they were entitled under Texas law and under federal law to that relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.341" offset="1559752">It seems to us that, despite the attempt to make this look like an abdication of state power, what we really have is a distant relative of Lugar, but a distant relative separated by a vast chasm, because unlike Lugar, in this case all we have is a winning plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.922" offset="1641986">And a 1983 that becomes an excuse whenever you have a constitutional complaint that you can make, that becomes an excuse for sideswiping state proceedings and engaging in federal flanking maneuvers, isn't just an express exception to the Anti-Injunction Act; it ends the meaningful operation of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.537" offset="1732474">And one of the answers Texaco gives I just want to spend a moment with, and that is they suggest, in line I think with your question, Justice Scalia: Oh, come on; there's really no impact on the Act; if you want to have us do it over again, we'll sue some state functionaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.963" offset="1794227">But of course, they concede in their brief in this Court that a suit against state functionaries where discretion is exercised, as it would be here, would be premature in a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.073" offset="1850652">They're simply speculating that the functionaries of Texas will effectively destroy them without giving them a meaningful opportunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="433.595" offset="1884716">Mr. Tribe, can I ask you a question on state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.530" offset="1896418">Supposing that Texas had the procedure that it has for corporations that are owned by Yankees, but all other corporations and Southerners have a right to appeal without posting any bond at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.457" offset="1952216">Would there be state action that you could challenge in that case?</text>

            <text syncTime="453.909" offset="1966009">Well, I would think then, Justice Stevens, the proper way to challenge what the state had done would be to ask the state, as Texaco has never done, to obliterate that distinction, to make a proper motion, and on denial in review in this Court there would be state action, just like Shelly v. Kramer.</text>

            <text syncTime="525.671" offset="2253042">That is, if there is no 1983 exception the Anti-Injunction Act is not a vague, fuzzy doctrine; it's a flat bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.842" offset="2281672">But just in case the Court is not persuaded, I do think it's important to recognize that there is far more wrong with what the courts below did than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.864" offset="2321796">That is, even if Section 1983 were available on some theory, the Second Circuit nonetheless impermissibly separated the sword of Section 1983 from the abstention shield that this Court in Mitchum v.

Hernandez, where there was a clear bifurcation between the attachment procedures of the state and the substantive action against the alleged welfare cheaters, just as in that case the Court said that it would not allow a kind of baloney-slicing approach to be taken by litigants who want to engage in flanking maneuvers, so here the fact that they choose to focus on whatever procedures might surround the issue of the bond and the security should not take this Court's attention from the fact that Texaco was not a litigant in aimless search of a court in which to appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.752" offset="2877369">They were before a trial court of plenary jurisdiction, the very court that gave them a three and a half month fully unsecured stay, during which it is clear that any respect for the courts of Texas would have led them, not to a federal court in White Plains or Anchorage or Hawaii, but right back into the court where they were litigating.</text>

            <text syncTime="1075.090" offset="4450672">You see, I do think they're arguing that the usual burdens should be reversed here, because even though the Texas parents involved in Moore versus Sims were not allowed to speculate that Texas remedies might not be adequate... this Court said such hostile speculations and predictions of futility will not do... and even though the Virginia prisoner in Smith v. Murray was not allowed to speculate, and even though the Ohio school teachers in the Dayton Christian Schools case were told that forecasts of frustration will not do, they have an argument which in essence says that: for us uncertainty was terrifying, because we had no way of knowing what would happen in the Texas courts; there's this three and a half month grace period, but for all we know those Texas judges will interpret it in a nasty way, or for all we know, even though in its own terms that grace period can only expire after a complete adversary hearing, it will be unreasonably cut short.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.247" offset="4695282">Therefore, our bankers and our financiers are nervous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.716" offset="4709179">Therefore we need instant relief, and nothing less will do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.735" offset="4725271">It's a kind of Fortune 500 exception for federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.305" offset="4743556">Everybody else has to take the rule as they find it, but we are now told that if you are rich enough and big enough to project your fears onto the stock exchange display board then you've got a better deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.648" offset="4800921">I do want to reserve time for rebuttal, but I want to suggest how important it is that this is the right Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.152" offset="4826939">This Court would have required exhaustion, as it did even in Volkswagenwerk in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.556" offset="4852539">They had requested relief from the Michigan Supreme Court, even though that court had not acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.841" offset="4869676">But what the district court in this case did was create an analogy to Monroe and Patsy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.347" offset="4899769">It said that because the Section 1983 plaintiff has a choice of forum and may as an original matter choose to go to federal court, we'll simply extend it a little to the defendant in a pending state proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.539" offset="4960477">That makes all the difference in the world, because what they got was a stay in aid of appellate jurisdiction, and the one court that could have been asked for it, this Court, if the courts below had denied relief, instead gets the case through the back door, through an avenue of relief that completely disorients the structure of federalism in place since the Anti-Injunction Act of 1793.</text>

            <text syncTime="1292.680" offset="5321072">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.001" offset="5338312">I'd like to begin with just a few moments of the facts of how we got here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.321" offset="5363599">A judgment was entered in the Texas court for $10.5 billion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.225" offset="5391289">At the time that judgment was entered, at the time that we had the proceeding in federal court, and indeed today, I think it is common ground that, as the Court of Appeals said, there is no serious dispute that, should Texaco be required to liquidate its substantial assets, it would be able to pay Pennzoil's judgment in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.174" offset="5487001">That was not only the conclusion of the courts below; it is what Pennzoil has said, and said repeatedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.011" offset="5514378">As supplemental finding 137 of the district court's findings indicates, Pennzoil has repeatedly said two things: one, that Texaco's net assets are approximately twice the amount necessary to satisfy the Pennzoil judgment; and second, that Pennzoil itself, as is set forth in Pennzoil's own words in supplemental finding 137, does not have any doubt that if that judgment is ultimately affirmed it will be collectible from Texaco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.786" offset="5661499">And indeed, as is indicated in the briefs, Pennzoil in the Texas courts as late as last July, when we were arguing the appeal from the Texas trial court judgment, again said that Texaco's assets were more than enough to satisfy the judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1424.517" offset="5848432">That the purpose... the filing of the post-judgment request put their priorities in place.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Boies</label>
            <text syncTime="1437.742" offset="5901303">Justice O'Connor, I think it does answer the priority issue, because under Texas law the reason for the priority is to assure collectibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.549" offset="5940487">That is, a judgment winner deserves priority in order to assure that he will be able to collect that judgment ahead of other potential creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.440" offset="5988134">Here there are two points that I'd urge the Court to keep in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.059" offset="6002554">The first is that as long as it is clear, as the amount of assets and Pennzoil's own statements indicate is the case, that there is enough money there for it to be collectible, priority is not really a consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.902" offset="6061904">Second, in this particular case, because if the judgment was executed on or if the lien were to be attached it would be the case, as the district court found, that Texaco would be placed into bankruptcy, though priority wouldn't occur because Texaco would just be an unsecured creditor, the only assumption that you could have for priority would be somehow Texaco and Texaco's other creditors would allow those liens to be attached or allow the judgment to be executed without going into chapter 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.527" offset="6212474">And as the court below found, that simply wasn't in accord with the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.896" offset="6229924">So that there is no priority, no meaningful priority, that could be achieved or was needed to be achieved in order to achieve the purpose of the Texas statutes of bond and liens, which is protecting the collectibility of the judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1561.573" offset="6396585">That point was never raised or the possibility of that point was never raised in the court below.</text>

            <text syncTime="1578.683" offset="6465026">But I would urge the Court to consider two facts in this particular context, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.986" offset="6490312">First, the amount of the difference between the judgment and the total net assets is such that it is at a minimum very unlikely that priority would become a factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.412" offset="6547991">And second, that no priority as a practical matter was going to be achieved through the bond and lien provisions, because, unless you make the wholly irrational assumption that Texaco and Texaco's other creditors would simply stand by while these liens and bonds--</text>

            <text syncTime="2996.365" offset="12135792">The state action on the bond and lien provisions... if we had brought an original action, I think we could have brought an original action in the state of Texas, as opposed to bringing it in the federal courts in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.826" offset="12213636">But I think that one of the things that this court's decisions have held is that when you are talking about bringing an original action, if you've got 1983 jurisdiction there's no... and you're not talking about enjoining a criminal proceeding or other proceeding where there's an important state interest... you do have the ability and the choice to choose a federal forum to vindicate that federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.411" offset="12316036">And while I'm not at all suggesting that the federal rights of large corporations are more important than the federal rights of individuals or the federal rights of small corporations, I think when we begin to divide federal rights and when we begin to treat the enforcement of the federal rights of citizenship that all people and all companies ought to enjoy under the Constitution, I think we endanger those rights for everybody, because I think that the principle that where you have a federal right you have, absent some special circumstances, the right to have that cause of action adjudicated in a federal forum is something that this court has repeatedly held to be of critical significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.839" offset="12497744">And here we believe that under Younger, which would be the appropriate issue if you had a 1983 action, you do not have that important vital state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.051" offset="12558557">And even if you did, we believe you'd come under one of the exceptions to Younger in the sense that you do not have an adequate remedy or, as the court in Gibson against Berryhill indicated, an adequate opportunity to raise and have timely decided, 411 U.S. 577, your constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.166" offset="12663047">It's not merely the opportunity to raise; it is the opportunity to have timely decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.320" offset="12683632">And the importance of that timeliness aspect was reinforced in the Middlesex case Mr. Tribe refers to, where they did say, where the court did say, you've got to have a plainly inadequate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.330" offset="12735667">But they then went on to quote the Gibson against Berryhill language to show that if your remedy is untimely it is inadequate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3169.043" offset="12826469">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.897" offset="12841934">I think that this case as it has now emerged is all about the question of limiting principles and whether there are any, whether instead we're being asked for a railroad ticket good for one company only, which will then come back to haunt the jurisprudence of this court and the faith of this country in the rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.096" offset="12942766">I think Justice Powell's question was critical about the question of limiting principles for this extraordinary theory about state action that has been advanced in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.785" offset="12989473">The theory basically is you invoke the courts of the state, and if you ever dare to do anything as radical as trying to enforce the judgment there is enough state action to provide a 1983 lawsuit anywhere where venue can be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.663" offset="13056974">The limiting principle suggested is primarily a theory about the substantive argument here, about due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.935" offset="13086126">That was Mr. Boies' answer to Justice Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.471" offset="13096262">It was we'll rarely have as strong a due process argument as we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.339" offset="13111726">Arguments on the merits are hardly limiting principles for threshold doctrines like state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.910" offset="13137953">It would be like saying the Anti-Injunction Act means that you can never get an injunction to stay proceedings in any state court, unless of course you happen to have a valid claim on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.985" offset="13186332">Essentially, that removes the shield of the Anti-Injunction Act absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.538" offset="13208484">That can't be a limiting principle, and we have yet to hear one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.756" offset="13225411">It seems to me that if one accepts their point of view, it means that there is a 1983 action whenever you have any constitutional argument you'd like to make arising out of a state proceeding; you don't really have to make it in the ordinary course and on review, and on review here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3292.206" offset="13319138">But even quite apart from Rooker-Feldman, that is, it is true that part of the limit that they derive is that if you really seek to review the merits of the judgment, rather than something that you can carve out, then Rooker-Feldman will stand in the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.317" offset="13383609">They did, of course, try to review the merits of the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.435" offset="13396043">They asked the district court to retain jurisdiction over the entire matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.339" offset="13415687">But that is not sufficient protection for a doctrine that would essentially make every private litigant a state actor, because that problem will arise even outside the Anti-Injunction Act context.</text>

            <text syncTime="3327.981" offset="13462290">Yes, but I wonder if your point under the Rooker-Feldman Act isn't perhaps stronger than your 1983 state action.</text>

            <text syncTime="3336.318" offset="13495622">Well, we think it's certainly as strong, Chief Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.187" offset="13507116">I mean, under the Rooker-Feldman point it's not just those two decisions; it's the very fundamental point that the kind of relief they got is quintessentially appellate, a stay in aid of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.477" offset="13548285">The Second Circuit I think may have been confused here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.060" offset="13558629">It cited the Nebraska Press opinion of Justice Blackmun in chambers, saying that it's not enough to be able to come straight up because when the state's highest court drags its feet, as they keep saying they fear the courts of Texas would do, there is no way to get relief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.223" offset="13631250">But that isn't true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.123" offset="13634802">I mean, on the very facts of Nebraska Press, when the state supreme court delayed, as when the Michigan supreme court delayed, there was relief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.377" offset="13663850">And we don't think Congress has ever conferred the kind of pseudo-original, pseudo-appellate jurisdiction to win stays in aid of appeal without any exhaustion, by analogy to Monroe v. Pape and Patsy v. Board of Regents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.637" offset="13724872">Now, one of the reasons that the limiting principle question is so fundamental goes to Justice White's question about Younger, the question of how far our theory of the Younger case carries you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.814" offset="13773565">Are we committed to the view that in every civil proceeding you might have a Younger problem?</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.266" offset="13795403">It really depends on the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.717" offset="13805225">Certainly if, as in Juidice, which was an ordinary private debt matter, you sue a state official, which they carefully chose not to do to avoid Younger, the fact that the underlying proceeding was purely civil does not deprive the state, New York in that case, of a fundamental interest in enforcing its judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.433" offset="13892056">But the reason you don't get to the Younger issue, Justice White--</text>

            <text syncTime="3468.336" offset="14023713">But it seems to us that the fundamental reason that Younger does not begin to consume the universe, even on our view of the matter, is that in most ordinary civil litigation 2283 is a bar to injunctive interference, but there is no bar and no 1983 entre.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.928" offset="14094035">Let me quickly turn to the other area where I don't think they have provided a limiting principle, and that is on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.951" offset="14118172">We did stipulate in the Texas courts, and we repeat it now, that we are happy to live with flexible arrangements analogous to those under Rule 62.</text>

            <text syncTime="3554.774" offset="14369470">That was what the district court said was the real problem here, other creditors could come in.</text>
