            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="151523">We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 85-1695, Societe Nationale Industrielle, et cetera, versus United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.167" offset="212127">Mr. Ford, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. John W. Ford</label>
            <text syncTime="18.431" offset="225188">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case concerns The Hague Evidence Convention which establishes procedures for gathering evidence located on the soil of other signator nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.235" offset="300421">The United States and the other Convention signators before the Court all agree the court below erred in holding the Convention does not apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.778" offset="346605">They all agree the decision of the Eighth Circuit should be vacated and the case remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.323" offset="364787">The major issue before the Court today is how to harmonize the Convention with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure because both are the law of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.224" offset="408359">As the amicus briefs show, the extent to which the Convention displaces U.S. discovery rules is a question on which the Convention signators hold divergent views.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.953" offset="459245">To reconcile those differences and to effectuate the Convention's purpose, today we urge the Court to adopt a general rule requiring resort by American courts to The Hague Evidence Convention in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.729" offset="526432">The Convention preamble states its basic purpose of mutual judicial cooperation in civil or commercial matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.476" offset="557361">Its history shows the Convention was adopted in large measure to avoid the friction created by the extraterritorial application of American discovery procedures as the new restatement of the law of foreign relations of the United States recognizes American attempts to conduct discovery abroad have been a major source of friction with our European trading partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.933" offset="659239">In negotiation of the treaty the United States obtained significant concessions from the civil law nations on the basis that Convention procedures would be a substitute for the unsupervised extraterritorial use of American discovery rules, or as some writers have referred to it, legal tourism by American lawyers on the discovery trail.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.876" offset="759027">At the bargaining table the civil law nations made clear they regarded such American discovery practices as invasive of their sovereign rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.341" offset="804793">Ultimately, the civil law nations agreed to liberalize and simplify the process for obtaining evidence through their Courts for use abroad as the quid pro quo for lessening foreign intrusions of their sovereignty.</text>
