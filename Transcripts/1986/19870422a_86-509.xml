            <text syncTime="59.205" offset="387313">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="68.477" offset="424407">The question here involves the validity of an amendment to the AFDC program that Congress enacted in 1984, a provision I shall refer to as the standard filing unit provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.368" offset="475920">This amendment was one of many budget cutting steps that Congress took in that year, and it was designed to close what Congress viewed as a loophole in the AFDC eligibility scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.443" offset="528270">Under prior law, a family applying for AFDC could try to maximize its AFDC grant by excluding from the filing unit certain family members, typically children who had other sources of income, such as Social Security benefits, child support, or accountable earnings from employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.391" offset="624087">This enabled the family to get the maximum AFDC grant for the members in the unit, plus keep all of the other income of the members who were left out of the unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.566" offset="668704">In 1984 Congress decided to eliminate this benefit maximizing option by enacting the provision challenged here.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.324" offset="707783">It requires that when a family applies for AFDC, all members of the family who live together must be included in the filing unit, and that the income of all those family members must be added up to figure out how needy the family is for public assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.785" offset="785628">Congress based this amendment on the belief that family members who live near the poverty level and who live together tend to share their income and expenses; and that therefore the most reliable index of the family's need for public assistance was the total income of the family members.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.082" offset="870787">Thus, rather than simply cutting AFDC to families across the board, Congress sought to target the benefit cuts in 1984 to those families that were, because of the members separate income, less needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.841" offset="937870">Now, appellees, of course, have no constitutional right to a permanently fixed level of AFDC benefits, and they therefore recognize that they could not bring a constitutional challenge to a decision by Congress simply to cut benefit levels without more.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.538" offset="1016655">What they argue, therefore, is that Congress did not really cut AFDC benefits here, but rather took property away from the children who are required to be newly included in the filing unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.964" offset="1078304">Appellees focus on child support income, and especially on the assignment provision enacted in 1975 which requires a mother who applies for AFDC to assign to the state any right to support that she or her child may have.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.228" offset="1159388">This provision was designed to improve collection of delinquent child support by transferring the burden of collection from the abandoned mother to the state with its greater enforcement resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.220" offset="1219365">Now, the assignment provision by itself works no hardship on the family, because for every dollar of support assigned to the state, one dollar of AFDC comes back to the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.730" offset="1273386">Moreover, a family that assigns child support also receives an extra $50 a month from the state by virtue of the child support disregard provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="918.095" offset="3822833">Two of them need food, and she gets back the money from AFDC.</text>

            <text syncTime="934.106" offset="3886885">I think it would be real hard to justify that.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.808" offset="3897752">But in the case of orthodonture, I'd like to point out again that the Medicaid is available to all the children in the filing unit automatically.</text>

            <text syncTime="955.353" offset="3971940">There has to be some kind of constitutional problem with the statute, or it cannot be declared invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.089" offset="3994823">And as I point out, the first problem with the other side's theory is, under state law, a child does not really have an absolute property right to child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.612" offset="4032962">What he has is a right to have the money used in his best interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.581" offset="4048844">State law permits, and indeed, requires the assignment of support to get AFDC for the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.087" offset="4078833">And state law therefore contemplates that it can be in the child's best interest to have his support money assigned to get AFDC for the family.</text>

            <text syncTime="1040.375" offset="4311950">But I think it's inevitable if you have a family-based grant, as AFDC is, you've got to look at the income of the people who live in the family to see how needy the family is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1879.968" offset="7670356">The actual, palpable, financial loss to the plaintiff children in this case is quite apparent from the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.925" offset="7706196">The two daughters of Joyce Miles, for example, lost $95 every month of their child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.829" offset="7733781">Similar amounts of money were lost every month by other children in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.216" offset="7759381">I think it would be helpful if we just walked through an example of how this practice actually works in North Carolina at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.922" offset="7798147">For example, Joyce Miles has five children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.124" offset="7810999">Two of them, the oldest two, are of a different father.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.326" offset="7819777">The three younger ones, they have separate fathers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.961" offset="7834301">The two oldest girls are the beneficiaries of a $189 a month child support payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.198" offset="7859274">It was ordered by the state court judge, who made a decision about the reasonable needs of those children and ordered this father to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.322" offset="7895741">Prior to 1984, when the rule was imposed, the mother did not receive AFDC assistance for those children; they were separated from the grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.178" offset="7931163">She had three younger who were not as fortunate to have a father who chose to support them, and she received $244 in AFDC for those children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.384" offset="7975989">In October of 1984 she received a letter from the State Department of Human Resources, which said, in order to continue receiving AFDC for those children for whom you are getting it, you must add the other children to the grant, and as a part of that, you must make their support available to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.851" offset="8073896">The state will take that money, keep the money; it will return $50 because there is now a $50 disregard; and we'll give you AFDC benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3147.492" offset="12740410">And there was another situation that was presented by this case where the father was paying $200 a month voluntarily without a court order.</text>

            <text syncTime="3177.444" offset="12860260">His child would have stayed at the same standard of living of an AFDC family, regardless of how much the father had paid; and so the support was reduced.</text>

            <text syncTime="3424.354" offset="13847897">Assuming that its finding was correct, the legislative finding, that families use all of the money that they get on all of its... on all of their members for the best interests of the whole family group, including money from support payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.464" offset="13904322">And they... the Federal Government says, we have to... we're... we have to pay out less.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.102" offset="13926892">We have to reduce the amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.304" offset="13935669">It makes sense to us to reduce the amount to those families that have $800 coming in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.756" offset="13953537">And we know as a matter of fact, never mind that theoretically they're supposed to be spent on only two of the children; we know that that family has $800 which is being used for the whole family.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.112" offset="13990944">This other family over here only has $200 that's being used for the whole family.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.064" offset="14010692">Now, I want the cut to hit the family with the $800 and not the family from the $200.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.384" offset="14028038">How could the Federal Government have done it lawfully?</text>

            <label>Ms. Jane R. Wettach</label>
            <text syncTime="3471.334" offset="14035875">We think it would be quite reasonable for the Federal Government, and constitutional, to have looked at that family, looked at the AFDC recipients, and determined how much their need was actually reduced by the fact that someone else in the household may have been sharing the burden of the joint expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.381" offset="14112048">This is particularly set out in our brief when we talk about an economy of scale reduction that could be made in an AFDC payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.320" offset="14147783">For example, if there... well, there's a chart that talks about, what's the individual's standard of need in a family.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.676" offset="14181220">And we all know that that individual goes down as the household gets larger, because you need... if you have an apartment that--</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3514.662" offset="14209119">But you wouldn't allow the support payments to be counted in at all?</text>

            <label>Ms. Jane R. Wettach</label>
            <text syncTime="3517.948" offset="14222284">--It's not that they're counted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.983" offset="14226464">They're not counted at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.250" offset="14231479">All they're doing is, you recognize that the need of the AFDC recipients is less because they don't have to share the whole... they don't have to pay for... for example, they don't have to pay for all of the rent, or all of the utilities, the shared expenses, because there's someone else with income who is sharing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.397" offset="14308070">So maybe there's a quarter of it that is paid by someone who is not in the unit, so they only have to pay for three-quarters of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.818" offset="14337746">So their need is a little bit less.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3548.836" offset="14345791">But that's not the reality that Congress has found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.020" offset="14354568">I don't care what your chart is, if you assume in theory that the mother is spending the money for the house which other people use and whatnot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.810" offset="14393752">The reality that Congress perceived was that all the money that comes into the family unit is distributed among all the family members on the basis of how they need it, period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.368" offset="14439937">And Congress wants to take that factor into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.601" offset="14448923">You just told me that there's no way that Congrss can do that?</text>

            <label>Ms. Jane R. Wettach</label>
            <text syncTime="3577.772" offset="14461566">No, I think I told you that there is a way that they can do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.891" offset="14474000">And they can do it in either of the two ways we suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.276" offset="14487584">Actually, they can do it by an economy of scale reduction of the AFDC recipients, or they can do it by an individual analysis of what is going on in a family, and if money is actually being transferred, they might count it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.452" offset="14544322">Let's take an example where there are three people in a household.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.054" offset="14558741">The child support child gets $100, the other two get $200 in AFDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.308" offset="14583715">The mother uses all the money the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.326" offset="14591760">Their need is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.460" offset="14600328">To say... then there's no transfer, and that's when Congress can't take it into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.564" offset="14624779">But to say that these two need a little less because there's a person outside the unit who is also contributing is reasonable, and Congress could cut in that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.907" offset="14674098">And we think that's constitutional, and we would have no complaints with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.227" offset="14703355">If there are no further questions.</text>
