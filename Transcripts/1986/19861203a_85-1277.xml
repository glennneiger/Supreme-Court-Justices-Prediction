            <label>Mr. Brian T. Hayes</label>
            <text syncTime="14.926" offset="208096">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.876" offset="215932">Today this Court considers whether the contagious, infectious disease of tuberculosis is a handicap under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.048" offset="252608">Additionally, a second question is presented as to one so infected is otherwise qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.185" offset="277163">Because of the split argument with the Solicitor General, I will address the facts and point two; the Solicitor General will address his remarks to point one in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.327" offset="317705">The facts, we submit, in this case are extremely significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.195" offset="333170">And the nondisputed facts are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.731" offset="343305">In 1977 Gene Arline was a tenured teacher with the Nassau County School system, teaching in the South Side Elementary School.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.551" offset="374548">The School Board had no knowledge... none... that she had in fact suffered from TB since age 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.122" offset="396909">In 1977 she had a relapse, that is, she became infectious, had a positive culture.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.543" offset="422509">She was suspended briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.560" offset="430659">In 19... in the spring of 1978, she again suffered a relapse, and at that time, Mr. Marsh, the superintendent, was contacted by the State Health Department, the local unit there in Fernandina Beach, which is in Nassau County.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.052" offset="484576">And they, that is, the State Health Department, recommended that this teacher is an unacceptable risk; please take her out of the classroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.474" offset="514251">She was not dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.891" offset="519893">She was removed with pay for the balance of the 1978 year; that is, it was in May, so there was only perhaps a month to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.347" offset="549777">The next fall, in November, she again tested positively, making the third positive test within an 18-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.270" offset="581438">At this point, once again... now Dr. McEuen enters the case, Dr. McEuen being a superior to Dr. Lund.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.125" offset="616860">And Dr. McEuen, who was assistant director for the State Tuberculosis Center, came to the school board, initiated the process, and said to Mr. Marsh: This woman poses an unacceptable risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.848" offset="663776">She was again suspended with pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.635" offset="674956">And in the spring, late spring of 1979, the school board conducted the administrative procedure to commence her dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.705" offset="699198">This procedure was eventually affirmed by the state court, the First District Court of Appeals in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.757" offset="719364">In 1982 she filed her complaint in the District Court in Jacksonville, and a trial was set, alleging for the first time, of course, that she was discriminated against because of her handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.000" offset="768370">There was actually two counts in the complaint, but the only count we're concerned with is count one.</text>

            <text syncTime="214.003" offset="1004412">She she had a history of being hospitalized, although we didn't know it.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.955" offset="1020190">In any event, as I was indicating, after the... the trial court in this case then went on and found, in an alternative type judgment, he found first of all that tuberculosis such as she suffered, and those are his words, and I'm quoting, it's the court's opinion that an infectious disease such as the plaintiff in this case had does not qualify as a handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.855" offset="1123844">But then he went on to say, if it does, assuming, arguendo, that it does, then the court must consider whether she's otherwise qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.342" offset="1153728">This goes into our second point.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.044" offset="1160520">If she's not otherwise qualified, she has not met her burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.829" offset="1175671">The burden is clear in a handicap discrimination case, or in a case under the rehabilitation act.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.817" offset="1199599">As Justice Marshall said, as recently as Choate v. Alexander, the plaintiff must establish that she has a qualifying handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.505" offset="1230424">She must establish that she is otherwise qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.707" offset="1243172">She must establish, if she's alleging discrimination, that she was discriminated solely because of her handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.278" offset="1269503">Now, if she fails in any of those particulars, the case is not made out.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.413" offset="1286012">This Court has stated in Southeastern Community College v. Davis, which is the benchmark case on "otherwise qualified", that simply means that with the handicap, or notwithstanding the handicap, he or she can meet all the of the requisite requirements, the legitimate requirements, of the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.858" offset="1351841">We suggest on point two that an infectious disease, where a doctor... and this is not a doctor employed by the school board; this is the state health professional... where that doctor says, Nassau County School Board and Mr. Marsh, don't put this teacher in a classroom with young children, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.105" offset="1432821">First of all, they're highly susceptible, and number two, it's an enclosed, confined room.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.509" offset="1454450">And TB, as we know... TB may be unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.877" offset="1467929">I'm not a medical expert, but we know it's communicated by breathing, by sneezing, by coughing.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.031" offset="1492484">So it's our position on point two that how can she be qualified as an elementary school teacher when she can't get down over Johnny's desk and help him with his penmanship and arithmetic without breathing, and thus creating a risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.957" offset="1552252">But this isn't our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.457" offset="1558208">This is an opinion of a state health professional.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.992" offset="1568344">So as a matter of law, we suggest, the record amply supports the trial judge's finding that if it's not a handicap, then she's not otherwise qualified.</text>

            <text syncTime="378.375" offset="1661862">In our reply brief, we've addressed that, Justice Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.744" offset="1671371">She was certified K through... K through 6, which is the basic elementary certification.</text>

            <text syncTime="403.259" offset="1761441">Absolutely, and she did not seek to get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.592" offset="1770741">On page 77 of the transcript, I asked her at the trial... this is not in the Joint Appendix... on a full page, Mrs. Arline, did you consider during the intervening four years going and taking the nine or twelve hours in French or... whatever you need?</text>
            <text syncTime="418.400" offset="1821941">She said she did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.166" offset="1829046">But that's only the first part of that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.435" offset="1838136">We would have a different inquiry, and it's not before the Court, had she been certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.921" offset="1856109">And then we'd be faced with Dr. McEuen's testimony that the risk is real as to all persons, but it's certainly an unacceptable risk as to elementary school teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.461" offset="1894248">So in a way, we have not reached that question of, had she been certified because she has not.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.931" offset="1916086">We simply suggest that the regulation is quite clear, under the duty to accommodate.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.185" offset="1937088">There have been no cases of this Court... there have been some lower court cases... but in referring to the duty to accommodate, the regulations specifically refer, and I'm talking about 45, the code of Federal regulations, 84.4 KL.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.429" offset="2002081">And it says: The duty to accommodate a handicapped person, who with reasonable accommodation can perform the essential functions of the job in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.819" offset="2047639">Now the job in question, we suggest, is an elementary school teacher, in an elementary school setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.323" offset="2073656">So it's our position, therefore, that she is not otherwise qualified for the position.</text>

            <text syncTime="611.790" offset="2595583">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="627.884" offset="2659949">The United States is concerned that handicapped persons get the full measure of protection intended for them by Congress in enacting and amending Section 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.925" offset="2700073">There is also concern that Section 504 be kept within manageable bounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.376" offset="2717836">And that means that it not be invoked to deal with all manner of social problems which were no in Congress' mind when it enacted that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.165" offset="2753049">In particular, we think it is important that Congress had no intention to displace the web of local, state, and Federal responses to the very different and the very difficult problem of contagiousness and epidemic.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.009" offset="2808429">That problem, and that difficulty, is well illustrated by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.313" offset="2825670">In this case, the school board, acting at the instance, indeed, at the insistence, of county, state... county and state health authorities, removed from a third grade classroom the respondent, Ms. Arline.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.203" offset="2881154">Having complied with these state directives, the school board now faces a suit under Section 504 for handicapped discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.826" offset="2919710">We maintain that this cannot be what Congress had in mind when it passed Section 504 and amended it.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.432" offset="2950117">When Congress amended Section 504 in 1974, it extended the coverage to cover not only persons who are presently handicapped, but persons who have a record of handicap, and also persons who are believed to be handicapped.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.925" offset="3008109">Further, Congress expanded the definition of handicapped to include any, quotes, impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.947" offset="3044158">But in the original enactment, as well as in the amendment, one feature remained constant: that to come within the statute at all, to count as handicapped discrimination or exclusion at all, the exclusion must be, quotes, solely by reason of handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.325" offset="3117719">And this phrase is what keeps the statute within manageable bounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.329" offset="3137676">This phrase is what keeps it from covering exclusion on all manner of other kinds of grounds, good or bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.852" offset="3171740">And it's this phrase which demonstrates why respondent's suit was properly dismissed in the trial court.</text>

            <text syncTime="794.210" offset="3325235">But it would be to argue in a circle to say that if one is excluded, for instance, by reason of contagiousness, from associating with others, then that exclusion constitutes an impairment, when the question you're asking is, whether the exclusion itself is by reason of handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.723" offset="3415305">That's a totally circular argument which lifts itself by its bootstraps.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.860" offset="3431815">The impairment has got to be in respect to an activity which is defined and considered apart from the exclusionary action which is the subject of the lawsuit, of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.085" offset="3488762">Now, contagiousness and handicap are obvious different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.857" offset="3515825">Some people are contagious without being handicapped; others are handicapped without being contagious.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.928" offset="3540066">They often go together; but not always.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.463" offset="3550202">Other characteristics, as well, may often go together with handicapped.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.866" offset="3575802">For instance, age; occupation; poverty; lifestyle.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.735" offset="3595341">Exclusion on the basis of any of these was not intended by Congress to count as exclusion solely by reason of handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.210" offset="3637242">In this case, nothing could be clearer than that the exclusion which took place was solely on the basis of contagion.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.399" offset="3674022">The school board did not know that there was any impairment in Ms. Arline whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="962.082" offset="3996687">Indeed, the American Medical Association, at page 6 of their brief, recognizes the phenomenon of the asymptomatic carrier, that is to say, the person who is infectious, who can spread the disease to others, but is in now way impaired himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.528" offset="4058440">And in that case, if the action is taken on the basis of that contagiousness, the fact that the person is or is not handicapped is simply irrelevant to the lawsuit under Section 504.</text>

            <text syncTime="2522.612" offset="10238803">And so coverage would be defined by the act of discrimination of the act of assumption.</text>

            <text syncTime="2548.847" offset="10343815">To allow contagion to be separated out and be the basis of discrimination would be to completely eviscerate the Act in its purpose of preventing stereotype discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.522" offset="10406509">Justice Marshall, in your opinion in Choate, you talked... you analyzed the Tennessee Medicare rules in that case in terms of whether they were facially neutral, or whether they had an exclusionary effect on the handicapped.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.716" offset="10467217">And you looked to whether they were based on criteria that were a test, judgment or trait... and the Court used the word trait... of handicapped to determine the propriety of the rules and whether they were violative of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3003.091" offset="12160788">The frequency of those methods, those testings, would be established by disease control standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.030" offset="12188478">The Center for Disease Control, cited in the APHA brief, talks about getting people... treating tubercular patients on an individualized basis, getting them back into work as quickly as possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="3126.405" offset="12653980">And I think if the Court reads the District Court's opinion, it will read it to be a very broad exclusion of contagious people from the Act; and a further assumption that contagious people can never be... or people who have at some point a contagious impairment, can never be qualified.</text>
