            <text syncTime="76.081" offset="440727">We contend two points on oral argument today.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.666" offset="451072">One is that the Fourth Circuit erred by equating the state and private parties, and two, the prejudgment interest may not be awarded without Act of Congress or consent against a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.258" offset="497465">Number One.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.224" offset="501331">States are not private litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.676" offset="511153">The Fourth Circuit committed error when it put states into the shoes of private litigants on the prejudgment interest issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.032" offset="540515">The last time the Court dealt with the question it explicitly rejected exactly the same argument, Board of Commissioners of Jackson County, Kansas, versus United States, in which Justice Frankfurter, for the Court, said,</text>
            <text syncTime="111.904" offset="583983">"Nothing seems to us more appropriate than due regard for local institutions and local interests. "</text>
            <text syncTime="118.410" offset="610001">The Fourth Circuit did not even cite Board of Commissioners of Jackson County, Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.129" offset="628913">The Congress subsequently has acted as well and acted in the same direction in the Debt Collection Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.348" offset="649811">The Congress excluded state and local governments from the statute, so Congress as well believes that states and private litigants are two different entities indeed when it comes to prejudgment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.324" offset="701743">The more recent cases since Board of Commissioners are along the same lines which this Court has dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.727" offset="723268">Congress is to decide the constitutional balance between Federal and state governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.131" offset="744897">In Garcia, the Court said that Congress would determine the reach, how far the relationship would go, how far Congress would reach into the power of states, and that is a Congressional decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.439" offset="794112">In Bowen v. American Hospital Association the plurality said that Congress must speak with a clear voice if it wants to change the relationship between Federal and state governments, and in Pennhurst I you said that a state must know the terms and conditions of a grant, know what is expected of us before we get that grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.852" offset="871852">Not surprisingly, the Court as well has said that the Congress is the one to decide how the Federal Treasury is to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.875" offset="903931">The Fourth Circuit reached in to protect the Federal Treasury, but that is not their judgment to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.410" offset="922007">It is the Congress's decision, US v Standard Oil in the 1940s, so Congress has determined and this Court has determined, both have said that private litigants and states are two different entities, and the Fourth Circuit did not recognize that.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.437" offset="978118">Argument Number Two.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.170" offset="985119">There is no statute and there is no consent applicable here so there is no prejudgment interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="494.222" offset="2113295">Congress will decide when interest is to be imposed, and they have done that in very clear terms, as we have said.</text>

            <text syncTime="507.898" offset="2167944">that is quoting the language of the Social Security Act, where Congress specifically said when interest would be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.635" offset="2190931">In the Medicaid statute they were even more lengthy in making clear that interest was to be imposed against a state government.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.871" offset="2219875">The quote is</text>
            <text syncTime="521.655" offset="2223010">"plus interest on such amount disallowed beginning on the date such amount was disallowed and ending on the date of such final determination at a rate based on the average of the bond equivalent or the weekly 90-day Treasury bill. "</text>

            <text syncTime="552.693" offset="2347144">The government doesn't... the executive branch therefore hasn't even contemplated interest in this matter until this case is brought, and by the way, we think this is the only case that we can find under the Disaster Relief Act where the government is seeking prejudgment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.418" offset="2402105">The Disaster Relief Act indicates there is no duty of the state to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.305" offset="2417570">The duty was imposed because of the contractual relationship between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.424" offset="2434079">The purpose of the relevant section, of course, was to provide temporary housing for the victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.261" offset="2453410">The Disaster Relief Act contemplates, in fact, five different ways for the states to pay these obligations or for others to pay the obligations, states, local governments, private parties, the Federal Government itself, or any combination of those four.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.885" offset="2507953">The Disaster Relief Act even contemplates percent loans and money paid back.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.705" offset="2531255">They mention that 6 percent loans can be made to businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.276" offset="2549540">That is in the same Act, the Disaster Relief Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.311" offset="2557691">If Congress at one point talked about 6 percent loans, talked about percentage interest, they didn't talk about it here, so it is a different matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.167" offset="2593113">Just as there is no statute which calls for interest to be paid by the State of West Virginia in the Disaster Relief Act, there is no consent either.</text>

            <text syncTime="624.290" offset="2633550">The letters were the basis of the contract, according to the District Court, and under the record at 821 and 884, the Federal officials outlined what the letter should say.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.578" offset="2670749">If there is no such language in those letters which contemplates interest, we would think the government at that point didn't contemplate interest, nor did the government contemplate interest, as the record shows, in the bills that they sent out.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.200" offset="2717246">There was no indication over the years that interest was going to be due to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.588" offset="2734801">I think when we see the word "charges" in the statute it is hard to take that word and say, well, that must mean prejudgment interest, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.194" offset="2765207">Many of us when we get our bills, if we get a bill from a department, store we expect the interest to be added each month.</text>

            <text syncTime="832.053" offset="3464662">It mobilized a lot of effort, and ultimately, although the advisory jury held there was no contract, the Court held there was a contract, so we feel there was litigation in good faith throughout the proceeding, but litigation based on the exchange of letters, which held that the state was liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.579" offset="3530700">If there aren't more questions, we feel that it there is to be prejudgment interest that decision must come from Congress or there must be consent.</text>

            <text syncTime="895.043" offset="3716587">Now, that statute was passed by Congress to tighten up on Federal debt collection practices, and it did so by mandating that interest be charged on debts owed by any person, so it made more stringent interest requirements nationwide.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.790" offset="3791611">It defined "person" to exclude states.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.759" offset="3807389">Both the Comptroller General, an officer of Congress, and the Justice Department in regulations interpreting that statute nave interpreted it simply to preserve, by excepting the states from the mandatory interest requirement, have simply preserved the common law entitlement, whatever it was, of the national government to get interest from the states, and those are set forth in regulations at 4 CFR 102.13.</text>

            <text syncTime="972.745" offset="4027340">I would like to turn next to a brief summary of what we think the salient facts are here, and we think these are important because the outcome may turn on the relative equities between ourselves and West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.969" offset="4076241">The District Court found and the Court of Appeals agreed that West Virginia had entered into an express unilateral contract to pay the Corps of Engineers for their site preparation work.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.861" offset="4123888">The Governor requested that the Corps undertake the site preparation activities, and that oral request was confirmed shortly thereafter in writing by the state's director of emergency planning, who wrote a series of letters to the Corps acknowledging that site preparation was the state's responsibility under the Federal statute and that the state</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.107" offset="4212809">"will be responsible for the costs incurred. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.392" offset="4234020">The Corps performed the work quickly and efficiently and the state gave us releases to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.830" offset="4263695">The Corps replied that bills would be forthcoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.950" offset="4276234">They were promptly tendered in the amount of about 4.2 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.685" offset="4299117">The Governor acknowledged the debt, stating that he would take steps to "consummate reimbursement", although he expressed his doubt that he could accomplish reimbursement during the then current fiscal year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.161" offset="4349064">In response to a series of dunning letters from the Corps the Governor asked for a meeting at which he again acknowledged the debt but asked that the Corps forbear from collection for a time to permit him to negotiate with the state's delegation in Congress with a view to getting possible relief from Capitol Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.992" offset="4432342">When that failed settlement negotiations ensued, and when those proved fruitless we were forced to bring this action to prevent the statute of limitations from running against our debt collection activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.251" offset="4489393">In the lawsuit the state's defense was that the Governor was incompetent to contract with the Corps on behalf of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.773" offset="4523457">Their theory was that in the middle of this flood emergency the Governor would have had to go through the normal procurement process of competitive bidding before awarding a contract to the Corps of Engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.165" offset="4573090">The court below rejected that defense, found there was a binding contract, and held the state was in breach of its contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.454" offset="4610184">The only... and this Court denied review of that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.239" offset="4625335">The only question at this stage, therefore, is whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the state should be required to pay prejudgment interest as one element of the damages for its breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.367" offset="4685834">The interest would run from the date the bills were tendered in 1972 until the date of the judgment of the District Court eleven years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.473" offset="4726272">The aggregate interest is now about $6 million, well in excess of the original principal amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.562" offset="4762634">The petitioner appears to agree with us that this question must be answered by referring to Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.751" offset="4791369">That is so because Federal law governs the interpretation of contracts to which the United States is party and also because the debt here was incurred ultimately under a Federal statute, namely, the Disaster Relief Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.844" offset="4859810">Petitioner also seems to agree that the Federal common law rule is that prejudgment interest is awarded as matter of course to the United States in action for breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.187" offset="4917175">The rationale of that common law rule is that where there is a breach of the contract to pay money the creditor is damaged by the delay in getting his money, and should be awarded interest to make him whole for his loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.148" offset="4984989">The only exception to this rule recognized by this Court is where it would be inequitable on the facts to award the Federal Government prejudgment interest, and the situation that typically has led the Court to find such inequity is where the Federal Government delayed unreasonably in asserting its claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.764" offset="5079447">That happened, for example, in the old case of United States versus Sandborn in 135 US, where the Court denied interest to the Federal Government, where it delayed for ten years in seeking to recoup money erroneously paid by the Treasury to a private party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.344" offset="5157815">It happened again in the Board of County Commissioners case referred to earlier where the Court denied interest to the Federal Government where it delayed for eight years in seeking to recover taxes on behalf of an Indian wrongfully collected by a state, a county in Kansas on Indian property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.008" offset="5244437">Therefore we believe that the Federal common law rule applicable both in cases against private parties and against states and their subdivisions is that interest is allowable unless it would be inequitable to allow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.100" offset="5304832">Petitioner here argues that this Federal common law rule should not be applied here, but that the Court instead should adopt state law as the Federal rule of decision, and by state law petitioner does not mean the generally applicable West Virginia law of contract damages which, like the Federal rule, would allow interest for a breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.602" offset="5410784">Rather, by state law petitioner means the exception to the general West Virginia rule of damages under which... which operates where the state itself is the defendant in the contract action, and under that exception a state is not liable, unlike other parties, for interest for a contract breach unless it has waived sovereign immunity expressly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.819" offset="5511722">So it is that sovereign immunity based exception to the general rule that petitioner wants to incorporate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.473" offset="5546308">That contention brings us to the Clearfield Trust line of cases where this Court has set for the factors that are relevant in deciding whether to apply a Federal common law rule or rather to adopt state law as the Federal rule of decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.117" offset="5616838">The Clearfield trust doctrine as elaborated in later cases like Yazell and Kimbail Foods essentially requires a balancing of the Federal interest against the state interests at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.896" offset="5679950">Now, the Federal interest will typically require resort to a Federal rule, as this Court said in Kimball Foods, where the Incorporation of state law would</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.037" offset="5724567">"frustrate a specific objective of the Federal program. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.656" offset="5743062">And we think that would be the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.191" offset="5757168">Although the Disaster Relief Act imposed much of the responsibility for bearing the cost of disaster relief on the national government it does affect a clear division of labor and cost as between the national government and the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.521" offset="5830520">One of these is that the states are required by the statute to prepare sites for temporary housing, and the statute requires that this site preparation be done by the state</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.329" offset="5881720">"without charge to the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.047" offset="5900633">We think that this statutory division of labor and cost would be frustrated by adoption of petitioner's state law rule here because the United States would then be required to bear a substantial portion of the site preparation cost through the loss of a time value of its money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.896" offset="5987986">Quite plainly the present value of paying the Corps of Engineers $4.3 million when it is due as compared to the present value of paying it $4.3 million eleven years later is much larger, and we think that the difference between the present value of getting your money now and getting it 15 years down the road would operate as a direct subsidy to the state's site preparation undertakings in defiance of the statutory mandate that site preparation be done by the state without charge to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.771" offset="6143467">For these reasons we think that adoption of the state no interest rule here would frustrate a specific purpose of the Disaster Relief Act and would therefore be improper under Clearfield Trust.</text>

            <label>Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1535.994" offset="6280349">Because our interpretation of that '82 Act is that by excepting the states from the definition of "person" the statute merely excepted the state from mandatory interest pursuant to the statute and preserved the status quo ante under which states could be held liable under the common law where applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.958" offset="6368224">So, in our view of the statute which the Comptroller General and the Department of Justice have concurred in, we would still be litigating this very issue under the new statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.165" offset="6413051">We have lost that interpretation, I think, in two Courts of Appeals now, and it is pending in others at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.771" offset="6451503">The second element of the Clearfield Trust doctrine requires reference to the state interests that are implicated, and we think that this factor as well points to the result I have just reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.412" offset="6502076">I think it is helpful here to consider the kinds of state interests that this Court has found persuasive in the past in adopting state law as the Federal rule of decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.022" offset="6556515">In the Yazell case, for example, the Court held that Texas law respecting marital property governed in interpreting the terms of an SBA loan contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.329" offset="6605730">The Court noted that the contract had been negotiated with specific reference to Texas law and that the state law at issue involved the "intensely local interest" of family property and the rights of married women, including their capacity to contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.560" offset="6682634">In Kimball Foods the Court held in another SBA loan case that state commercial law governed the priority of creditors' liens on secured property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.968" offset="6732267">The Court noted that the SBA loan there again had been negotiated by reference to state law, that the Federal Government was acting as a money lender in an ordinary commercial context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.275" offset="6785452">The state law at issue was a commercial code of general application on which businessmen relied daily in making their lending decisions, and the Court held that failure to adopt state law there would have disrupted commercial relationships in the state, for example, by impairing the integrity of the state's notice filing system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.041" offset="6872597">Thirdly, in United States versus North Carolina, a case in 136 US, the Court adopted state law to decide the availability of post-maturity interest on a defaulted state bond held by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.752" offset="6943441">We think the reasoning of that case has been superseded by modern cases like Clearfield Trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.256" offset="6973429">We think the result in that case was plainly correct under the modern Clearfield Trust doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.512" offset="7002477">There the Federal Government had invested in state bonds, and state law denied post-maturity interest to investors in those bonds generally, and the Court, I think, quite sensibly held back in 1890 that it would have been impossible to have the rights attaching to a bond vary depending on who happened to own the bond at the time of the lawsuit because the bonds were freely transferable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.047" offset="7128597">Therefore the Court correctly held, in our view, that the state law denying post-maturity interest should apply to all investors, whether they be private parties or the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.807" offset="7187633">I think that the interests referred to in the Court in these earlier cases stand in rather stark contrast to the interest the state is urging upon the Court here in support of its state law rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.733" offset="7243326">Here the state is not trying to preserve the integrity of any state program like a bond program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.454" offset="7270180">It is not trying to protect family or property values.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.608" offset="7286794">It is not trying to protect marital relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.910" offset="7300064">It is not trying to protect settled commercial expectations of its citizens, nor is it even seeking to apply the general law of interest under the state's contract remedy statute because that would allow interest here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.772" offset="7367460">What the state is trying to do is to avoid paying money because of a claim of sovereign immunity, but we think that a claim, a mere claim of sovereign immunity standing alone is entitled to no weight when the state is litigating against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.149" offset="7436946">It is clear that sovereign immunity did not bar the Federal Government from bringing this lawsuit in which a state has been held liable for breach of contract, and there is no reason why sovereign immunity should be any more relevant in and of itself in determining the measure of damages for breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.849" offset="7531823">So, for these reasons we think--</text>

            <text syncTime="1857.954" offset="7568185">--Well, the opinion there referred to state... to local institutions and what Justice Frankfurter went on to say was that under the more modern law of the Court, Indians had come to be regarded increasingly as like any other citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.932" offset="7648120">Although they were in a way the wards of the Federal Government, Justice Frankfurter said that the law had evolved to try and treat them as much as possible like any other taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.557" offset="7690647">So the Federal Government there was suing on behalf of an Indians not in its own right, and I think the Court suggested that under those circumstances it would be important to defer to the state's treatment of taxpayers generally because Indians want to be treated like any other taxpayer as far as possible, and in any event he went on to base the holding of the case on the Federal rule under which interest is recoverable unless it would be inequitable, and he found it would be inequitable because the government had delayed for ten years... eight years in bringing the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.349" offset="7841844">So, I think even the earlier discussion by Justice Frankfurter in that case does not work against our position here because he was talking about the state's interest in maintaining parity among its taxpayers, including Indians, and there is no equivalent state interest in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1961.772" offset="7983532">So we think that for these reasons the state interest here, because it is merely sovereign immunity without more, is not enough to justify the adoption of the state no interest rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.461" offset="8026269">Therefore the rule that should be adopted is the Federal interest rule which, as I said before, is that interest is awarded unless it would be inequitable to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1998.445" offset="8130131">We think the proper approach is to adopt the Federal rule, and the fact it is the same as the general state rule maybe makes an even stronger case for doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.419" offset="8170046">As I noted before, the inequity that typically has caused this Court to deny interest to the United States under the Federal common law rule is where the U.S. has delayed in presenting its claim and the other party is innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.660" offset="8226993">Here, we did not delay and the state was not innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.730" offset="8247369">The Corps of Engineers undertook this work at the express request of the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="2037.522" offset="8286448">We demanded payment promptly and repeatedly, and the state kept putting us off, using a variety of dilatory tactics, forced us to bring suit, and then interposed the strained defense that they were not liable for the debt they had acknowledged all along because the Governor was incompetent to contract on behalf of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.469" offset="8382265">If any inequity was practiced here, we think it was practiced against us by the state, and to decline to award us interest would damage us considerably and would reward the state for its dilatory conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2087.705" offset="8487173">First, I wanted to respond to the charge of the state being dilatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.239" offset="8501384">The fact is that the advisory jury held that the state was correct that there was no contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.893" offset="8523953">The fact is that the first District Judge on the case held that there was no duty by the state to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.964" offset="8548300">He denied summary judgment, and he said there would have to be a trial on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.499" offset="8562406">Those facts in turn the jury found to be such that the state prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.368" offset="8577870">The District Judge found otherwise and ruled against the state, but the District Judge, partly based on these equities, determined that the state would not have to pay pre judgment interest.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="2119.990" offset="8616322">But even during the period when the state was acknowledging the debt it wasn't paying it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.544" offset="8638579">It is true that later there was some reason to believe there wasn't any debt, in this state claim there was none, but even when the state acknowledged there was a debt it just wasn't coming up with the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.900" offset="8672015">How long did that last?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles G. Brown</label>
            <text syncTime="2137.102" offset="8684763">Justice Scalia, the government alleged that the state was acknowledging the debt through letters from the Governor and other officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.772" offset="8711513">The state never conceded that it was acknowledging the debt through those letters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.826" offset="8723738">I think the District Court found that the letters themselves constituted the debt, not the later acknowledgment, but that the later acknowledgment certainly factored against us in his findings, I am sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.682" offset="8767101">The point is, there were a lot of equities on both sides in this case from the start.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.003" offset="8792388">The state was informed that it had a duty to pay for site preparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.157" offset="8809002">The government continues to argue that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.623" offset="8814853">Judge Copenhaver in the District Court said the state has no duty to pay, and as I pointed out, there are a lot of ways that this could happen, including the Federal Government paying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.596" offset="8846827">There was misinformation on both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.214" offset="8853305">The Corps of Engineers dealt with a person that had a budget of $50,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.499" offset="8870442">He in turn mounted up $4 million of obligations, and the Corps never informed him or any of his superiors what the ongoing cost was despite their procedures generally to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.890" offset="8915999">There was no mention in those letters that interest would be paid and the so-called dunning letters the government mentions, there was no mention there that the state would owe interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.846" offset="8951735">Interest was something that the state found out about in 1978 from a 1972 flood, and it is something that we never were held liable to pay until a 1985 court decision which we would not be able to pay until 1987, and that gets us very much to the reason that there is no prejudgment interest against sovereigns without Act of Congress or consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.159" offset="9033028">It has been that way historically and interest has always been treated differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.778" offset="9047552">Witness Library of Congress versus Shaw in the last term where you treated interest as something different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.799" offset="9067614">The budget process is different with states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.815" offset="9075660">We have a balanced budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.984" offset="9080362">Forty-nine states are required to have one, all but Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.919" offset="9092064">We have to plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.803" offset="9095617">Every two years we have to start over with a new legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.788" offset="9107529">There has to be this planning, and the states simply cannot act with the celerity of an average man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.525" offset="9126546">A court decision in many close calls may be necessary and the state won't even know what interest would be owing in the area of prejudgment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.648" offset="9163013">The state, by the way, never pays prejudgment interest under state law.</text>
