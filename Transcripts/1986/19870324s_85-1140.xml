            <text syncTime="9.989" offset="131703">This case also comes to us from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.210" offset="152601">The respondent is a car man employed by the petitioner railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.140" offset="172245">He brought an action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act alleging that the railroad had condoned his harassment by his supervisor and fellow employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.491" offset="213728">That the harassment had resulted in his suffering a severe emotional breakdown.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.742" offset="234730">The District Court dismissed the complaint holding that the injury arose out of a workplace dispute, which was subject to mandatory arbitration under the Railway Labor Act, and therefore the FELA action could not be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.466" offset="285617">The Court of Appeals reversed holding that the dispute did not turn on the collective barganing agreement and was therefore was not subject to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.512" offset="317799">The court also took the opportunity to state at some length that claims were intentional infliction of emotional distress are cognoscible under the FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.372" offset="361267">We agree with the Ninth Circuit in so far as it held that the RLA does not bar respondent's action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.022" offset="395853">However because the record of the case is not sufficiently developed at this stage yet to make it appropriate to address the question whether an FELA action is available for the type of emotional injury that respondent alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.271" offset="452800">We do not address that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.354" offset="461159">Our opinion is unanimous.</text>
