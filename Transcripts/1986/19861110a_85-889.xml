            <text syncTime="226.178" offset="1051012">And inside he found a hair brush, a heavy metal flashlight, clothing, and he also found cocaine, cocaine paraphernalia, Quaaludes, and $700 in cash in one container and $200 in cash in a separate container on a pouch on the outside of the backpack.</text>

            <text syncTime="421.402" offset="1831864">The Colorado Supreme Court specifically said that it did not reach or decide the state constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.889" offset="1857882">In Illinois versus Lafayette, this Court held that in the course of an otherwise lawful... that during an otherwise lawful inventory search at the booking desk, it was permissible for police officers to open and inventory closed containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.920" offset="1957983">And our position is that the same reasons that supported the inventory of closed containers at the booking desk in Lafayette apply with equal force here.</text>

            <text syncTime="695.875" offset="2929738">However, in Illinois versus Lafayette this Court refused to impose such a less intrusive means requirement on jail personnel.</text>

            <text syncTime="755.865" offset="3169751">The Respondent has also argued that closed container inventory searches during inventories of automobiles will lead to a parade of horrible results.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.388" offset="3215831">This is not true because there is already criteria in the case law that would limit the application of the inventory exception to particular facts and situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.844" offset="3249686">And lower courts have been in the past and will continue to be fully able to apply those criteria to separate the lawful inventory search from the unlawful pretext search.</text>

            <text syncTime="1044.083" offset="4322587">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.343" offset="4391655">It is our position that this case is controlled by this Court's decisions in Lafayette and Opperman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.662" offset="4412971">Respondent's claim that the search of his backpack violates the Fourth Amendment rests at bottom on the proposition that a routine inventory search cannot validly extend to the contents of containers located inside a lawfully impounded motor vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.272" offset="4471381">According to Respondent, the score of such an inventory search is per se unreasonable even if performed pursuant to standard police department procedures, as the district court found was the case here, and not a mere pretext for an investigatory motive, as the district court found was not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.984" offset="4546195">We believe that Respondent's proposed limitation on the scope of valid, routine, inventory searches is not supported by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.656" offset="4576915">Indeed, we believe that Respondent's view has in principle, if not in fact, already been squarely rejected by this court in Lafayette and in Opperman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.595" offset="4612651">No doubt for this reason, since this Court's decision in Lafayette the Colorado Supreme Court stands virtually alone in upholding the limitation on routine inventory searches urged by Respondent here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1296.477" offset="5332168">The facts of this case illustrate that quite well, how a container that was giving no outward indication that it might contain a valuable in fact did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.250" offset="5367276">In Opperman this Court recognized that the legitimate needs of the inventory search justified the routine inventory search of a motor vehicle in police custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.855" offset="5401758">In Lafayette, this Court recognized that these same needs justified the routine inventory search of a backpack taken into police custody at the station house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.128" offset="5434777">We see no reason to suppose that these same needs don't justify an inventory search of basically the equivalent of the Lafayette shoulder bag in the Opperman vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.936" offset="5486081">The legitimate and fully reasonable need for the police to learn what is in the contents of a container taken into custody does not magically end once a container is found within a motor vehicle, nor begin only when the container is itself physically located at the station house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.998" offset="5554313">The facts of this case we believe illustrate both principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.599" offset="5568732">In this case the police were in lawful custody of Respondent's motor vehicle and its contents in the field, and had to determine there what to do with its contents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.805" offset="5605513">They faced a purely administrative function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.590" offset="5616693">It was plainly reasonable, we believe, for the police in deciding what property in the car to take for safekeeping in the property room in the station house to inventory the contents of containers they found, as long as the search was performed, as it was here, in a manner that was reasonably confined and subject in scope to those limited ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.939" offset="5706032">The contrary view, which is what Respondents propose here, we believe, would inevitably lead to undesirable judicial management of routine administrative procedures and, even more fundamentally, it would likely lead to procedural rules that would be incompatible with efficient and prompt police administration of their caretaking, non-investigative function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.436" offset="5792027">For example, Respondents propose that the validity of a routine inventory search should turn on a case by case inquiry into the availability of less intrusive means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.427" offset="5836017">Such a requirement would be fundamentally incompatible with the notion of a routine administrative procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.898" offset="5857856">Inquiry into the needs of the police in a particular case, such as that undertaken by the Colorado Supreme Court here, into the subject of suspicions about the contents of specific containers, the availability of certain towing companies, the relative records of various towing companies, the privacy expectations that owners might have with respect to an infinite variety of containers, would inevitably convert a routine administrative procedure into an ad hoc process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.513" offset="5956390">Both the purposes of the inventory search and, ironically, the rationale of this Court's acceptance of such searches would both be defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.785" offset="5993379">Respondent also proposes that consent should be a prerequisite to a valid inventory search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.106" offset="6014695">Of course, requiring consent would be tantamount to saving that inventory searches are not entitled to any special Fourth Amendment analysis, because consent is already an exception to the Fourth Amendment probably cause and warrant requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.830" offset="6061611">In any event, as this Court has recognized already in Opperman, consent does not recognize or address the legitimate needs of the police to protect themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.554" offset="6104452">No doubt for these reasons, both in Opperman and in Lafayette this Court has already squarely rejected the constitutional requirement of consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.458" offset="6136112">In our view, the sole inquiry in each case should be threefold:</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.112" offset="6154711">First, whether the property is lawfully in police custody for non-investigative reasons;--</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.266" offset="6175400">Second, whether there exist routine inventory procedures that are reasonable in scope and subject;--</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.337" offset="6203612">And finally, whether the police have followed these routine procedures in the case at hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.507" offset="6224301">In this case, all three inquiries support the reasonableness of the search and were supported by findings of the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.179" offset="6258992">Accordingly, we believe that the decision of the Colorado Supreme Court should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.715" offset="6277173">If there are no further questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1570.023" offset="6426385">Officer Reichenbach, who was put in control of Mr. Bertine's car, waited for a dog impound officer to remove Mr. Bertine's animal from the car and, long after Mr. Bertine had left the scene, he started what he called an inventory search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.968" offset="6502140">He testified at the hearing that that inventory consisted of him going into the truck to see if anything of interest was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.525" offset="6544354">He checked the glove compartment, as in Opperman, and then he immediately went to the backpack that he found behind the front seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.298" offset="6575492">He had no inventory sheet with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.581" offset="6584582">He didn't begin an inventory of that backpack, and the trial court found that the inventory of the backpack was done some time later, after the search of the backpack.</text>

            <text syncTime="1628.729" offset="6661173">He opened a nylon opaque pouch inside the backpack, and inside that found four containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.133" offset="6690848">Those containers were metal, opaque, lock-sealed tin cannisters, four by one by three inches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.804" offset="6725539">He opened each of these locked containers, clip-locked containers, individually and found the contraband in question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2860.939" offset="11590061">That alleviates the need to balance the container issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.510" offset="11608347">If the Court decides to reach the container issue, we would ask the Court to fashion a doctrine that properly balances in the field inventory context, not in the automobile exception context and not in the incarceration jailhouse context, properly balances the defendant's Fourth Amendment interests that have been upheld in luggage in Chadwick and Sanders against the governmental interests... protect themselves against false claims, loss of property, or the possibility of dangerous instrumentalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.695" offset="11733108">The mere possibility of dangerous instrumentalities in these kind of containers clearly argues too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.635" offset="11760798">If you adopt the prosecution's argument, then the police can search containers in any situation, even in investigative situations such as Chadwick, because you don't know if the double-locked footlocker contains a dangerous instrumentality when you take it into your possession to store it at the police station.</text>

            <text syncTime="2983.503" offset="12080328">Well, the case clearly has to be remanded to the state court, because the state court didn't rule on the state constitutional grounds on which the evidence was originally suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.959" offset="12118153">If the DA were to go back to trial today, after a reversal of the Colorado Supreme Court, he still wouldn't have any evidence, because the trial court suppressed the evidence on state constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.583" offset="12160576">And we would disagree with the district attorney on the clearness of the Colorado state ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.706" offset="12201118">It would be our submission that the Colorado court, although citing the Fourth Amendment, said that the Colorado constitution may exclude this evidence also.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.645" offset="12240824">And so it's not clear that the prosecution wins even if this Court issues what may be an advisory opinion on this issue to the Colorado Supreme Court.</text>
