            <text syncTime="212.814" offset="1001584">There are provisions under the regulations for partition of Indian allotments in certain circumstances, but the ones we have here are undivided interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.304" offset="1031572">The Court of Appeals held that this escheat provision effects a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution because of the absence of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.794" offset="1077548">We submit that it does not, and that Section 207 is in fact an exercise by Congress of the traditional power of the sovereign that has been repeatedly recognized by this Court to regulate the devolution of property upon the death of the owner, and beyond that we submit that it represents a reasonable exercise by Congress of its unique responsibilities on behalf of Indians to prevent a fragmentation policy that has inhibited the economic development of Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.130" offset="1194890">This problem arose by virtue of provisions in the original allotment Acts, the General Allotment Act having been passed 100 years ago, in 1887, and the Sioux statute in 1889.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.271" offset="1247448">To prevent improvident alienation of the allotments and to protect its tax-exempt status, Congress provided for the allotments to be retained in trust status by the United States for 25 years subject to extension for ten years by the President, but because of this period of trust status in the beginning Congress provided for the disposition of the property at death, even in the original Acts, by stating that the property would pass to the allottee's heirs in accordance with the laws of the state where the property is situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.790" offset="1369492">This had the effect of incorporating the state law of intestate succession into Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.527" offset="1396451">Then in 1910 Congress enacted a statute that for the first time authorized allottees to dispose of their property by will.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.014" offset="1422364">Thereafter the allotment policy was repudiated most profoundly in the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, and for tribes that chose to come under the IRA and the Allalla Sioux tribe in this case was one such tribe, the Act had the effect of extending indefinitely the trust period for Indian allotments, and also preventing further allotment of the lands, although Congress did enact 25 USC 483, which permits an individual who owns an interest in an allotment to apply to get a fee patent to the land and have it partitioned or to sell it, so it has not been frozen in trust status irrevocably.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.591" offset="1588712">The heirship provisions, though, had the effect of causing the breakup or the fractionation of the interests from generation to generation.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.149" offset="1630926">Typically what happened either under the heirship statute or the provision for disposition by will is that the original allottee's interests was divided among his heirs or devisees in undivided interests, and then when each of those heirs or devisees died his interest in turn was subdivided, so that over the course of l00 years, with each passing generation these interests become further divided, and that is vividly illustrated by the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.800" offset="1733535">The interests that escheated by appellee's decedents in this case, in one instance the de minimis interests would subdivide among seven heirs, that is in the case of the named appellee here, Irving, thirteen heirs in the case of appellee Pumpkin Seed.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.345" offset="1807723">So, this shows that today if... in the absence of this statute these interests would continue to further subdivide.</text>

            <text syncTime="1506.861" offset="6177799">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, what I first want to place before the Court today is the significance of these property interests in terms of the decedents, Charles Pumpkin Seed, Chester Irving, Edgard Pumpkin Seed, and Geraldine Cross, and then also in terms of the appellees who, but for Section 207 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act, would have inherited these interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.860" offset="6273826">When you translate the percentage figures and the dollar limitations of the Indian Land Consolidation Act into everyday terms and in terms of the values of the decedents, and you take, for example, Charles Pumpkin Seed, who had nine interests which were subject to transfer to the tribe under this Act, those interests, this 2 percent or less interest amounted to one-third of an acre all the way up to, one of his interests was the size of four and a half acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.213" offset="6383226">The other decedents had similar ranges in terms of the size of the interests that they were... that were subject to transfer to the tribe under the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1567.069" offset="6418648">Are you saying, then, Ms. War Bonnett, that these were not undivided interests, that they had been partitioned?</text>

            <text syncTime="1572.888" offset="6441950">No, I am suggesting that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.072" offset="6450622">These are undivided interests, but their share of the interest was four and a half acres, and if you look at the history of Indian land policy, the reason that these people had undivided interest was not actually their doing, but actually government policy which set up the allotment scheme and then determined that these interests would pass in an undivided status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.771" offset="6541424">So the fact that they did not, could not go, Charles Pumpkin Seed could not go to the John Shot allotment and say this four and a half acres is mine and I have trees and whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.979" offset="6582279">He still had an interest which translates into four and a half acres of land, which is a significant amount of land, certainly enough land to put a house, certainly enough land to put a garden, and to characterize these interests as insignificant and de minimis is not correct in terms of the Indian people and how they viewed these interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.642" offset="6664931">It is also important to look at the dollar figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.677" offset="6677052">The law provides that if you have not... if these interests had not earned $100 within the year preceding death then these interests would go to the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.200" offset="6715190">Again, the total... it is true, Geraldine Cross only received $135 in the year preceding death for all of her 26 interests, but the factual record below was not really developed in terms of the poverty of the Oglala Sioux Indian Reservation or the clients here, but I think the Court could take judicial notice of the fact that Bureau of Census figures put the Oglala Sioux Indian Reservation as one of the poorest counties... Shannon County, South Dakota, is one of the poorest counties in the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.552" offset="6836608">To say that to Geraldine Cross or to the other decedents that $135 did not increase their spending power, did not allow them to buy things for the family, and is insignificant is not correct when you look at the interests of the individuals who had these property interests taken.</text>

            <text syncTime="3184.240" offset="12887298">The tribe wanted or said that these... it should not receive these properties without compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.211" offset="12911226">Well, nothing in this statutory scheme prohibits the tribe from making compensation to individual members if it chooses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.115" offset="12934841">Another alternative that is open to the tribe under the 1984 amendments is to pass a statute providing for an alternative disposition of these interests rather than having them escheat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.852" offset="12969741">One possibility would be to have them descend by intestate succession to other owners of fractional interests in the same parcel, which would prevent the further fragmentation of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.291" offset="13003491">With respect to Justice Powell's questions about the possible sale of the property to others, there are alternatives other than sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.028" offset="13034420">One is to give it away, to exchange, which would require no monetary investment at all to assemble a more substantial interest, or to purchase ones from others, all of which could cause the interest to rise above the 2 percent level, and if there are obstacles to the sale of the land, for instance, that may well reflect nothing more than the problems created by the very fractionated ownership that this statute was designed to protect against.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.512" offset="13136402">One of the principal problems that Congress was responding to was the inability to sell these parcels of land and the fragmentation of ownership and the assembly of tracts that could be economically used, just as in Lock and in Texaco versus Short.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.938" offset="13202126">We think for the reasons stated in our opening brief and reply brief that appellees are quite wrong to say that the Sioux Allotment Act had some unique contractual element that the General Allotment Act, which it really mirrors, did not have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.031" offset="13254475">The language was drawn directly from the General Allotment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.066" offset="13266596">This Court in Jefferson versus Fink said that did not create any contractual rights, and there is no evidence from the background that Congress intended to contract away or that the Sioux understood that Congress was contracting away its right to regulate the descent of Indian property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.743" offset="13325319">But it is important to point out that even vested rights, as this Court said in Texaco and Lock, the retention, the permanent retention of private ownership rights, the legislature can condition that retention on the performance of certain affirmative acts which, among other things, would negative any suggestion of abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.454" offset="13404209">And one of the characterizations Congress used of the fractionated ownership or fractionated interest when it enacted this statute was that there is an element of abandonment to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.262" offset="13443393">The individual owners don't occupy the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.545" offset="13452588">They receive a check.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.547" offset="13456559">It is an entirely passive relationship which is not conducive to a personal responsibility or nexus to the land, which is what Congress was hoping for when it passed the Allotment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.986" offset="13494279">So this statute actually furthers the purpose of the General Allotment Act and the Sioux Allotment Act.</text>
