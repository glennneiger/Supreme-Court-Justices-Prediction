            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="155768">We will hear argument next in No. 85-1708, California versus Cabazon Band of Mission Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.509" offset="197773">Mr. Walston, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="roderick_eugene_walston" startTime="61.322" stopTime="171.943">
            <label>Mr. Roderick Eugene Walston</label>
            <text syncTime="61.322" offset="401006">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question presented in this case is whether state laws prohibiting high stakes gambling are applicable to tribal gambling operations, most of which feature bingo.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.110" offset="456176">The question as we see it breaks down into two major questions: first, whether state gambling laws are applicable under the balancing test that this Court has established in past Indian law cases, which has often been referred to as a form of federal common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.402" offset="525348">The second question is whether state gambling laws are applicable here under Public Law 280, which of course is a federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.587" offset="554083">Before beginning my argument I would like to briefly summarize our main argument before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.859" offset="575190">Our view is that four major factors support state jurisdiction here as those factors are relevant under the balancing test, and I would like to briefly mention them.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.296" offset="612911">First, in our view the tribal games here are successful primarily because they are illegal under California law in that they allow non-Indians to play high stakes bingo in circumvention of state law, and therefore the value of the games essentially derives from restrictions that the state places against its own non-Indian citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.551" offset="697966">Second, the states, not Indian tribes, have traditionally regulated gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.764" offset="726805">Therefore the activity in this case falls within the traditional province of states, not Indian tribes, and therefore as we view it the principal of tribal sovereignty is not implicated in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.272" offset="768810">Third, the federal government does not in any way regulate or supervise these games.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.654" offset="794305">They are wholly unregulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.767" offset="802769">Fourth, because of the high stakes and lack of regulation the tribal games create in our view a serious risk of infiltration by organized criminal elements.</text>

            <text syncTime="903.658" offset="3770384">Essentially most of the tribal bingo operations that are proliferating nationally have taken place as a result of a 1982 decision by the Fifth Circuit in the Seminole Tribes case.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.154" offset="3812284">So the phenomenon before this Court is a fairly recent one, but going back to the organized crime question, the President's Commission on Organized Crime recently noted that gambling, second only to drugs, is a major source of income for organized crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.965" offset="3875605">The National Gambling Review Commission, which was established by Congress to study the links between gambling and organized crime concluded that high stakes bingo does indeed attract organized crime because of the large amounts of cash that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.874" offset="3935164">And that Commission, a Congressionally established Commission, recommended that the only effective way to prevent organized criminal infiltration with respect to bingo games is for the states to provide for adequate regulation and control of the games.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.214" offset="3992529">The California Attorney General Task Force issued a report in 1971 in the same vein, and the Attorney General Task Force noted the experience of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.453" offset="4029518">New York in the late 1950s legalized bingo.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.372" offset="4041221">The games were quickly taken over by organized criminal elements and New York was able to regain control only by establishing and enforcing stringent limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.670" offset="4082390">Therefore our view is that state regulation of gambling is the main bulwark against organized criminal infiltration, but under the view being asserted by the tribes today that bulwark is not present with respect to the tribal games here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1437.252" offset="5904692">No, California gets money from the state lottery and the state horseracing act, but it does not get money from charitable bingo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.035" offset="5923814">The money from charitable bingo, of course, goes just for charitable purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.697" offset="5942517">I should add that part of the moneys from the state lottery do indeed innure to the benefit of Indians themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.751" offset="5974700">To date the state lottery has generated about $850 million for education of California school children, and given the percentage of Indian enrollment in the public schools in California about $6.5 million of state lottery funds heretofore have been expended just for the education of Indian children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.564" offset="6057979">So the Indian children themselves receive the benefits of California's state lottery, and it is therefore difficult for us to understand the tribal argument that somehow the existence of the state lottery militates against the state position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.486" offset="6113672">Another major factor in this case, we think, is the existence of the Organized Crime Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.052" offset="6163931">This is an act that was passed by Congress in 1970, and it prohibits gambling operations in violation of both state and local law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.578" offset="6194024">On its face the act might make California gambling laws directly applicable on Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.342" offset="6225058">But whether or not that is so, our view is that the Organized Crime Control Act at least expresses a federal policy, a federal policy that supports the state position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.700" offset="6270511">It expresses a federal policy we think in favor of state regulation of gambling and against unregulated gambling, and therefore as we view it federal policy in this case is high congruent with the purposes of California law, and also, as I mentioned earlier, the states, not Indian tribes, have traditionally regulated gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.912" offset="6351386">Gambling has not been traditionally regulated by the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.565" offset="6366015">A fortiori, it has not been traditionally regulated by Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.389" offset="6385241">It is a traditional function of the states that, as Justice Stevens pointed out, goes back some time in history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.844" offset="6411050">It is very analogous to the type of liquor regulation that was involved in the Rice case, where the Court held that Indian tribes have not traditionally engaged in the regulation of liquor sales.</text>

            <text syncTime="1763.905" offset="7211337">I would note at the outset that in the cigarette tax case that the incidence of the tax at issue there was on non-Indians.</text>

            <text syncTime="1794.213" offset="7332545">Here the incidence of California's regulatory scheme is solely on the operators.</text>

            <text syncTime="1808.011" offset="7387716">They are evading no state obligation by doing so, so California's interests are simply not implicated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1827.707" offset="7466501">In this case, as a further distinction, in that case the Court said that what the Indians were marketing, what the tribes were marketing there, the sellers, was really an exemption from state tax laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="2315.287" offset="9416908">First, Indian tribes are governments, and like all governments they have to have a source of revenue in order to function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.813" offset="9450971">Now, most tribes do not have a natural resource base.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.445" offset="9469466">The Cabazon and Marango bands have reservations out in the middle of the desert, and until there is a commercial market for sand or sagebrush they do not have any sort of natural resources to generate tribal income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.456" offset="9533518">As a result they nave turned to bingo along with more than 120 other tribes around the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.711" offset="9566537">In doing this they have been acting very much like the 28 states, including California, that have established state lotteries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.646" offset="9598302">The purpose is the same, to provide governmental revenues for public purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.759" offset="9618782">This is in essence a form of voluntary taxation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2382.190" offset="9684506">The only information in the record, which has to do with the size of prizes actually awarded here, is that for a representative four-month period during 1984 the average jackpot on the Cabazon reservation for their bingo games was $184.89, well below the state maximum limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.686" offset="9786488">Now, that is not to say that in some games they don't offer larger prizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.960" offset="9803520">They do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.410" offset="9805401">We have conceded that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Roderick Eugene Walston</label>
            <text syncTime="3491.827" offset="14123024">Just a few comments, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.158" offset="14132323">First, the plaintiffs have stated that under California law the Indian tribes in this case cannot conduct charitable bingo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.313" offset="14164924">We differ very strongly with that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.475" offset="14177567">The California penal code defines a charity as an entity that is exempt from state taxation under the state revenue and taxation code, and Section 23701(f) of the state's revenue and taxation code provides an exemption for a not-for-profit entity that is engaged in promoting the social welfare, and our view is that Indian tribes can qualify as charitable organizations within the meaning of that section and therefore can conduct charitable bingo on the same terms as other charitable organizations in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.974" offset="14303582">The plaintiffs also stated that the Coleville case was not applicable in this case because the incidence of state regulation there fell on non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.194" offset="14348512">There are two responses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.565" offset="14358021">First, the Court in Coleville seemed to regard the incident of state regulation as irrelevant, and instead it held that Indian tribes could not gain a commercial advantage over non-Indian businesses by marketing products free of the limitations that may apply to those non-Indian businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.524" offset="14421864">The second response is that the incidence of state regulation here falls... does indeed fall on non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.230" offset="14452584">It falls both on the tribes and on the non-Indian patrons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.144" offset="14468258">California law specifically prohibits both the operation of and the participation in a lottery, a prohibition that is found in Section 320 of the California penal code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.970" offset="14511621">Therefore it is illegal for non-Indians to participate in these games.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.804" offset="14526981">The plaintiffs also argue that the tribes are required, are required to submit their management contracts to the Secretary of the Interior for his approval.</text>

            <label>Mr. Roderick Eugene Walston</label>
            <text syncTime="3615.176" offset="14616424">Well, at a lottery that is not authorized by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.239" offset="14624679">Charitable bingo is authorized by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.310" offset="14632934">Therefore it is not illegal under California law to participate in an authorized charitable games.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.154" offset="14660310">In other words, charitable games are legal under California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.698" offset="14674521">Therefore the charity that runs the game can lawfully operate the game, and the people who play the games can lawfully participate in them, but lotteries that are not permissible under California law impose the sanctions both against the operator and the participant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.637" offset="14738259">The tribes also made the statement that the tribes are required to submit their management contracts to the Secretary of the Interior for his approval, and that is simply not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.514" offset="14781727">There is no requirement in federal law that requires these management contracts to be submitted to the Secretary for his approval, and indeed the Cabazon tribe in this case commenced its bingo operation in March, 1983, and didn't submit its management contracts for approval until September, 1986, after this Court granted review of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.390" offset="14873260">So it ran the operation for three years without submitting he management contract for approval, and apparently got around to doing that primarily to improve its position in this litigation.</text>
