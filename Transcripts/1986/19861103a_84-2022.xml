            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="140652">We will hear arguments first this afternoon in No. 84-2022, 324 Liquor Corporation doing business as Yorkshire Wine and Spirits versus Thomas Duffy.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.511" offset="198644">Mr. Kantor, you may proceed when you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bertram K. Kantor</label>
            <text syncTime="17.837" offset="211914">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this afternoon I would like to establish three points in my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.364" offset="250053">The first is that the New York statutory scheme for resale... for retail liquor pricing constitutes resale price maintenance, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.140" offset="297178">The second point I would like to establish is that the New York statutory scheme is not saved by the state action exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.076" offset="328943">And the third proposition is that the statutory scheme is not saved by the 21st Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.306" offset="353811">Just some brief background to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.227" offset="369485">Appellant is a neighborhood liquor store located in Manhattan who was suspended by the state liquor authority for alleged violation of Section 101(b)(b) of the New York Alcoholic Beverage Control law in that the appellant had made two retail sales of liquor below the minimum resale price for such items which had been set by the wholesaler for those items in the month in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.356" offset="482020">It is noteworthy that the appellant was found to have violated a statute which ostensibly requires a 12 percent markup over what the statute calls 18 percent markup on the sales in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.286" offset="565716">Now, the explanation for this curious phenomenon which I have described is that Section 101(b)(b) does not require a minimum markup over the retailer's actual cost, but rather over something called the bottle price, which is able to be set by the wholesaler freely without any state supervision or control.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.135" offset="673132">However, the economic reality is that the bottle price is not a good proxy for the retailer's actual cost because retailers rarely purchase liquor from wholesalers by the bottle.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.910" offset="736244">They rather purchase by the case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="151.970" stopTime="158.201">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="151.970" offset="748469">The bottle price is a real price.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.735" offset="755574">It is the real price at which the wholesaler would have to sell it if he sold it by the bottle.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bertram K. Kantor</label>
            <text syncTime="168.683" offset="815343">He would charge the bottle price to the retailer in the event that the retailer sought to acquire his liquor in less than case lots.</text>

          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="178.226" stopTime="181.395">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="178.226" offset="853481">If he buys one and a half cases he gets half a case at the bottle price.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bertram K. Kantor</label>
            <text syncTime="181.395" offset="866229">Yes, I believe so.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.770" offset="871663">The example that comes to mind is the rare bottle of 40 or 50 year old Scotch that a retailer may purchase one bottle from a wholesaler or let's say a very exotic brandy or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.906" offset="924221">The products that were involved here were something called Chatham Gin in a 1.75 liter bottle, which is not an item you would acquire by the bottle.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="206.041" stopTime="225.503">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="206.041" offset="964763">But it is still not theoretically just a made up resale price that the wholesaler can impose without any real world consequences to himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.288" offset="1009798">It is a real price, the price at which he will sell less than case bottles.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bertram_k_kantor" startTime="225.503" stopTime="456.646">
            <label>Mr. Bertram K. Kantor</label>
            <text syncTime="225.503" offset="1042608">I would accept the first portion of your proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.832" offset="1051908">I will not accept the second.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.844" offset="1055983">It is a real price in that it is available should the retailer want to buy by the bottle in the unlikely event.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.467" offset="1086494">The second portion of the proposition is that the real world consequences of setting a high bottle price is that you lose very few sales because the bulk of your sales are made at retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.009" offset="1132678">What we have here, and the record demonstrates this, is the ability of the wholesaler to control the bottle price and the case price and the relationship thereto and thereby to confer in some cases supercompetitive profits of over 30 percent on retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.206" offset="1193387">The record further contains actual advertisements which are placed by wholesalers in liquor trade journals in which the wholesaler traders the fact to the retailer as a selling point that we are going to confer upon you markups of 20 percent, 28 percent, 30 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.715" offset="1267470">In fact, one ad says we have a whole line of liquor that can give you a 30 percent markup.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.478" offset="1290562">So something is awry here.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.508" offset="1302683">You do not have a normal situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.865" offset="1312087">This clearly is not a statute that mandates a 12 percent markup on a real retailer cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.878" offset="1348136">Now, under the New York statutory scheme that I am referring to, 101(b)(b), the New York Court of Appeals held below as a matter of state law that the statute does not mandate a correlation between the case and bottle prices filed by the wholesaler.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.509" offset="1434654">The Court of Appeals also held below that the state does not actively supervise the wholesaler's price filings.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.179" offset="1465269">As a result, under the New York statutory scheme, as I said a moment ago, a wholesaler is free to set a high bottle price in relation to his case price, and thereby confer supercompetitive profits upon retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.202" offset="1529426">Now, why this is a violation of the Sherman Act is that the Sherman Act clearly condemns resale price maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.512" offset="1570699">Further, this is a combination in unreasonable restraint of Section 1 in that the wholesaler under the statute is given the power to set price with no state involvement, and the retailers are compelled by state enforcement of the statute to adhere to the retail price, minimum retail price fixed by the wholesaler.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.486" offset="1670592">Thus you have the same kind of a combination that was struck down in Parke Davis or in Schwegmann, indeed in Midcal.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.982" offset="1700580">In fact, the state's opinion does not... the opinion of the state court below does not even discuss whether this is a price maintenance scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.603" offset="1746974">It assumes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.571" offset="1750840">It states clearly this is a price maintenance scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.555" offset="1766827">Indeed, in the portion of the opinion below that deals with state action in determining that it was not state action holds that this price maintenance scheme is not actively supervised by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.941" offset="1816355">The only reason that we are here is because the state court below found that the statute was consistent with the 21st Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.201" offset="1857419">And I will perhaps address the temperance and 21st Amendment questions to save some time.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.682" offset="1907365">In justifying the statute under the 21st Amendment, again, the state court below was silent on the issue of temperance.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.180" offset="1941325">This is because there is no legislative history which indicates that the statute was based on temperance.</text>

            <text syncTime="456.646" offset="1967134">Mr. Kantor, is it your position that the 21st Amendment will never justify a state interest in the protection of retailers?</text>

            <text syncTime="471.922" offset="2028260">It is my position that in this case the conflict between state law as represented by 101(b)(b) and the federal law as represented by the Sherman Act was needlessly created by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.698" offset="2083431">There are many ways in which the state presumably could properly address the question of protecting small retailers under the 21st Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="513.530" offset="2194712">I would further concede that if we had a statute here that sought to concern loss leaders or predatory pricing of some sort, that that would not cause a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.855" offset="2232015">I further concede that if you had a statute here which sought to prohibit sales below actual cost, that would not create a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.914" offset="2268273">What we have here is that the state has created a retail price maintenance scheme under the guise of protecting small retailers, and thus has needlessly offended the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.175" offset="2321250">If the state sought to approach this some other way, that would be a different case than I believe the case we have here.</text>

            <text syncTime="560.889" offset="2384152">Well, there is much more of a record here than in Midcal of an effect of helping retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.042" offset="2416753">There just wasn't that kind of a record in Midcal, was there?</text>

            <text syncTime="573.713" offset="2435457">--I don't know that I would agree that there is more of a record here about preservation of small retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.367" offset="2462102">In fact, the state's claim that this statute preserves small retailers is totally unsubstantiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.380" offset="2494076">The record here is that in 1971, when 101(b)(b) was passed there were approximately 5,000 retailers in the state of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.128" offset="2521139">As of July, '86, there were approximately 3,000 retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.596" offset="2539006">Therefore it would be very hard to make an argument that this statute has protected small retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.203" offset="2561367">In addition, even assuming arguendo that it had, and I think we have established it had not, it is the state that is needlessly creating the conflict here between state and federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.196" offset="2613403">It is our position that if the state could address the subject of protecting small retailers in a way that did not violate the Sherman Act that would be a different case than this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="915.097" offset="3801034">The statute could not be saved by either the state action doctrine or the 21st Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="930.544" offset="3862788">As In Midcal, the New York statute creates a resale price maintenance scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.276" offset="3881700">Liquor wholesalers control the retail price of liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.431" offset="3898314">Both the Court of Appeals and the New York legislature specifically recognized that the state sanctions resale price maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.193" offset="3929348">As in Midcal, the real question posed by this case is whether such resale price maintenance is protected from invalidation by the state action doctrine or alternatively the 21st Amendment, rather.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.750" offset="3979607">We believe it is saved by neither.</text>

            <text syncTime="1549.879" offset="6340136">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question before the Court is whether New York may impose a statutory minimum markup on retail liquor prices when that statute which prohibits below cost pricing operates entirely within the state and involves no concerted action between independent entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.462" offset="6446402">There are three separate reasons why this Court should reject appellant's facial attack on the below cost statute and its as applied attack on that statute which is limited to the anticompetitive effects of the Bulletin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.067" offset="6496871">First, there is no contract combination or conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.316" offset="6513903">Second, the state's direct imposition of the price restraint is ipso facto immune under Hoover v. Ronwin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.297" offset="6553818">And third, the state was acting pursuant to its core constitutional power under the 21st Amendment to structure its liquor distribution system to address perceived flaws in its local market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.558" offset="6606794">Last term in Fisher this Court reiterated that when a statute is challenged on its face under the antitrust laws this Court will strike it on preemption grounds only if it mandates or authorizes conduct which necessarily constitutes a violation of the antitrust laws in all cases or if it places irresistible pressure on private parties to violate the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.203" offset="6709403">As the Chief Justice explained in Norman Williams, such facial condemnation follows only if the conduct contemplated by the statute is in all cases a per se violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.026" offset="6764678">If it is not, this Court will analyze it under the rule of reason and will not condemn it in the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.820" offset="6795921">In Fisher this Court faced an identical facial challenge to a rent control ordinance in the City of Berkeley under which the landlords claimed that the ordinance formed a combination between the city and its officials on the one hand and landlords on the other, or a horizontal combination among landlords.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.216" offset="6889439">As Justice Marshall explained, even though the economic effect of that ordinance was exactly the same as a horizontal combination among landlords, a restraint imposed unilaterally does not become concerted action simply because it has a coercive effect on parties who must obey the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.113" offset="6981076">New York's statute here operates exactly the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.205" offset="6997377">It directly imposes the 12 percent markup on retailers.</text>
