            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="136388">We will hear argument first this morning in Number 86-461, the Board of Pardons and Henry Burgess versus George Allen and Dale Jacobsen.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.974" offset="184244">Mr. Smith, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Clay Riggs Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="15.343" offset="197724">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="23.781" offset="231474">The issue before the Court today is straightforward: does Section 46-23-201 of the Montana Code Annotated create a liberty interest in parole release protected under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.029" offset="316424">The facts giving rise to this case are equally straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.449" offset="342128">In May 1984 the Respondents, on behalf of themselves and all present and future inmates at the Montana State Prison initiated an action in the United States District Court for the District of Montana alleging in relevant part that the petitioners, who are the Montana Board of Pardons and its Chairman had denied their parole release application without an appropriately worded individual determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.654" offset="466994">Attached to the complaint were communications from the petitioners to the respondents stating that the respondents' parole applications had been denied because of the nature of their offenses, and further recommending that the respondents commence, or continue participation in psychological therapy programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.221" offset="577230">In January of 1985 the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim, relying on this Court's 1979 decision in Greenholtz versus inmates of the Nebraska Correctional and Penal Institute.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.683" offset="651105">The respondents appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, raising as the only question that presented before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.341" offset="697707">In June of last year the court of appeals reversed the district court's judgment, finding that the Montana statute did create a protected interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.214" offset="745146">In relevant part the Montana law provides that the Board of Pardons shall release on parole any inmate who otherwise satisfies certain specified minimum time of incarceration requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.212" offset="825185">When in the Board's opinion there is reasonable probability that the inmates may be released without detriment to themselves or to the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.185" offset="873041">The statute further provides that the Board may release on parole prisoners only when the Board determines that such release is in the best interest of society and only when the Board concludes that the prisoner is able and willing to fulfill the obligations of a law-abiding citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.933" offset="960081">The Montana Supreme Court in a series of cases commencing in the early 1960's has construed parole under our statute as creating only a privilege or an act of grace and not a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.145" offset="1032910">In 1962 in the case of Goff versus State, the Court held in the context of an initial parole decision denial that,</text>
            <text syncTime="236.820" offset="1083588">"Because of the discretion vested our Board under our statute, such decisions were not reviewable by state courts. "</text>
            <text syncTime="246.176" offset="1120995">Several years later in another case, In Re Frost, our Court held that merely because an inmate satisfied the minimum time of incarceration requirement, that parole was not automatically required under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.388" offset="1189854">The issue before the Court today must in the petitioner's view be resolved by answering a single question: does the Montana law convey to an inmate a reasonable expectation of favorable action upon his parole application simply by virtue of the inmate's having satisfied the minimum time of incarceration requirements which under the law are a condition precedent to the right to even submit an application for parole release.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.728" offset="1339275">This is question which, we respectfully submit, was not straightforwardly addressed by the Court of Appeals below, nor has it been addressed directly by the respondents in their briefs before this Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.189" offset="1405103">It is a question which the petitioners believe must be answered negatively.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.676" offset="1427046">In resolving this question--</text>

            <text syncTime="326.978" offset="1444287">General Smith, may I just ask, the statute certainly doesn't give them that right because it says they can't be released unless they meet the time requirement, but it says they shall be released when, in the opinion of the Board, there is reasonable probability the prisoner can be released without detriment to the prisoner or to the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.024" offset="1516385">Is it your view they don't have a duty to release him even when they make that finding?</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="380.280" offset="1657446">What are the three conditions?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="clay_riggs_smith" startTime="384.184" stopTime="572.072">
            <label>Mr. Clay Riggs Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="384.184" offset="1673119">The three conditions are as follows: in Subsection 1 of 36-23-201 the statute states that a prisoner shall be released on parole when in the Board's opinion such release can be effected without detriment to the prisoner or to the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.680" offset="1759010">In Subsection 2 of that provision it states that release shall only be ordered if the best interests of society will be furthered and only when the Board concludes that the prisoner is able and willing to fulfill the obligations of a law-abiding citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.661" offset="1843020">As a consequence, in the petitioner's view, the statute sets forth three general criteria which govern its decision making.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.885" offset="1883875">In resolving the question before the Court today, the Court has substantial guidance from its previous prisoner entitlement decisions involving rights alleged or held to arise under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.632" offset="1970915">Of particular importance today, of course, is the Greenholtz decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.421" offset="2006024">There the Court initially held that the existence of the mere possibility of parole, at least under a state statute, did not give rise to a protected interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.645" offset="2054925">The rationale for the Court's decision in Greenholtz is especially pertinent to our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.068" offset="2084600">Because parole decisions depend, as the Court stated in Greenholtz, upon an amalgam of factors some of which are objective but many of which are purely subjective evaluations by Board members based upon their expertise or experience in the difficult and sensitive task of evaluating the advisability of parole release, there is no set of facts which have shown mandates a favorable decision to the inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.823" offset="2227647">Stated another way, under a typically worded parole statute in this country an inmate has no legitimate expectation at the outset of the parole application process that a Board will rule favorably upon his application because the nature of the decision making that goes into that determination is so general and so subjective.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.059" offset="2340600">Thus, as the Court further noted in Greenholtz, a prisoner has at most a unilateral hope that the benefit sought will be obtained, but not a reasonable expectation of affirmative relief from the involved decision maker.</text>

            <text syncTime="583.594" offset="2470690">The court of appeals did not directly address the question of whether a reasonable expectation of parole release arises simply by virtue of a prisoner satisfying certain time of incarceration requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.476" offset="2562223">The court of appeals instead apparently stated that,</text>
            <text syncTime="611.113" offset="2580822">"Because our statute requires release when the Board determines that the three general criteria that I referred to before are satisfied, that the construct of the statute is such as to create a reasonable expectation... excuse me, to create a liberty interest.

            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="632.694" offset="2667131">And your contention is that because the second criteria is because it requires the opinion of the Board as to reasonable probability that the prisoner can be released without detriment to the community, that is sufficiently subjective so there is no reasonable expectation?</text>

          <turn speaker="clay_riggs_smith" startTime="650.072" stopTime="692.332">
            <label>Mr. Clay Riggs Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="650.072" offset="2736617">The petitioner's view of the statute is that it sets forth three general criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.844" offset="2771725">The criteria that the Chief Justice just referred to is the first that appears in Subsection 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.117" offset="2804848">There are two others in Subsection 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.317" offset="2813626">It is the petitioner's position that because those criteria, taken in the aggregate, impose such general release considerations that an inmate can have no reasonable expectation that his set of facts will be deemed by the Board to warrant favorable action on his parole or release application.</text>

            <text syncTime="698.236" offset="2929296">Stated another way, Your Honor, the Board must conclude that the facts underlying a particular parole release application are such that its action to effect parole is not constrained or inconsistent by any of the three criteria.</text>

            <text syncTime="1335.427" offset="5478011">Your Honor, the statutory construct in the Nebraska statute in Greenholtz stated that a prisoner shall be released unless the Nebraska Board of Parole determined that one of four statutory criteria for deferral existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.574" offset="5562648">There was, therefore, a presumptive right absent an affirmative finding by the Nebraska Board to parole release.</text>

            <label>Mr. Clay Riggs Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="1415.879" offset="5799839">The principal difference is a difference which the court of appeals has noted, is that there is under the Nebraska statute, again a presumptive right to release simply upon fulfilling certain minimum eligibility requirements under Nebraska law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.721" offset="5863265">Those requirements also relate to time of incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.357" offset="5881759">I would respectfully submit that the difference between the Nebraska law and not only the Montana statute but virtually every... a large majority of parole statutes in this country which contain release criteria comparable or almost identical to those in the Montana law, lies not in the amount of discretion which is given to the parole decision makers, but in the unique... as the Court put it in Greenholtz... structure and language of the Nebraska statute which in essence created a presumptive right subject to the feasance in favor of parole release.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.040" offset="6072453">I would further note that there was an absence in the Greenholtz case, and it was noted in the majority opinion, of any relevant state decisional authority construing the scope of an inmate's entitlement or interest under the Nebraska statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.252" offset="6149358">None was cited in the briefs before the Court and none, of course, was cited in the Court's opinion itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.305" offset="6173599">Montana, on the other hand, has through the series of decisions that I have made reference to, consistently construed parole release under our statute as a matter of grace or privilege and not of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.481" offset="6234308">So, there are both technical differences in the construct of the language between the statutes and existing state authority construing the scope of the right under that statute that distinguish this case meaningfully, we believe, from Greenholtz.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.263" offset="6321348">In conclusion I would simply note that because the question which we believe must be answered in this case is whether our statute creates a reasonable expectation of parole release.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.642" offset="6394909">The respondents' suggestion that any statute which imposes substantial limitations on a decision maker's discretion would essentially eviscerate the first holding in Greenholtz which was that the mere existence of a right to parole release does not give rise to a protected interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.292" offset="6497518">It seems quite obvious that the respondents are uncomfortable with the well-established standard and that as a consequence they have been forced into the position of arguing the creation of a new standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.517" offset="6550390">We believe that standard is inappropriate in a prison system setting and we urge that the court of appeals' judgment be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2781.819" offset="11263611">"Subject to the following restrictions, the Parole Board shall grant parole. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.306" offset="11281583">and then it lists three restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.540" offset="11286494">Those restrictions are certainly not any less broad than the restrictions and that the limitations that this Court has in five nine-to-nothing decisions recognized, that they create a protected liberty interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.303" offset="11365593">The standards in Vitek, for example, were that placing... or transferring an inmate to a mental hospital, first of all the statute there said "may", and then the only criteria was that it will endanger the public safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.783" offset="11443438">And the Court said that that created a protected liberty interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.569" offset="11458589">What is crucial here is that their hands are tied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.806" offset="11479591">There is a limit to the outer reaches of their discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.258" offset="11497355">They cannot deny parole for any reason that they want to, and they must grant parole in a certain situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.796" offset="11531523">Indeed, counsel conceded that crucial point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.898" offset="11543957">He conceded when he was up here that if the Board finds that A, B, and C, the three restrictions set forth in the statute, are met the prisoner must be granted parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.742" offset="11599337">That is our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.277" offset="11609472">That is all we are asking this Court to find.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.494" offset="11618354">Because under this Court's decisions those prisoners, therefore, have a legitimate expectation of release and that is what this Court found in Greenholtz.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.352" offset="11661717">Unless there are further questions, I have completed my presentation.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="2887.571" offset="11686586">Thank you, Mr. Pevar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.357" offset="11693795">Mr. Smith, you have three minutes remaining.</text>

            <label>Mr. Clay Riggs Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="2892.392" offset="11705916">There are just three points I would like to cover in my reply argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.915" offset="11743950">First, as Justice Scalia pointed out, through its regulations, specifically in Section 20.25.505, the Montana Board has adopted many of the criteria, in fact all the criteria contained in the Model Penal Code with respect to determining parole release applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.446" offset="11834125">There are, however, two critical differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.815" offset="11843634">In the introductory paragraph in that section the word "shall" has been changed to "may" so that, the Board may order parole unless it determines that one of the reasons for deferral does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.694" offset="11919075">Then secondly, it has added Subsection "M", any other relevant reason, which does not appear in the Model Penal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.466" offset="11950213">It did, however, appear in the Nebraska statute.</text>

            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="2957.085" offset="11964633">Is that, and any relevant reason may be used to deny or to grant parole?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="clay_riggs_smith" startTime="2970.225" stopTime="2973.277">

            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="2973.277" offset="12029417">Because I thought you said, it may grant parole for any of the following reasons, "A" to "M" and then it added, "for any relevant other reason".</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="clay_riggs_smith" startTime="2979.581" stopTime="2990.103">
            <label>Mr. Clay Riggs Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="2979.581" offset="12054703">The administrative regulation states that the Board may grant parole unless it determines that one of four reasons for--</text>

            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="2990.103" offset="12096708">Are the "A" to "M" reasons for granting or reasons for denying?</text>

            <label>Mr. Clay Riggs Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="2993.805" offset="12111546">--Well, in the second section of that portion, it lists various factors which may be considered by the Board in determining whether to defer or to grant release and the last of those factors is factor "M" and it states, "any other relevant reason".</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.683" offset="12183017">In conclusion, I would simply note that the proposed standard suggested for resolving this case by the respondents is in fact no standard whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.860" offset="12231813">It is a standard which essentially repudiates the reasoning of the Court's prisoner entitlement cases beginning with the 1974 decision in Wolff versus McDonald.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.084" offset="12288656">It leaves state decision makers, if adopted, in the quandary of determining at best fine and at worst almost metaphysical questions concerning the degree of discretion that exists under a particular state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.462" offset="12350200">It is a standard which is not workable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.845" offset="12359709">It is a standard which bears no support from previous decisions of this Court and it is a standard which we respectfully submit should not be adopted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3065.937" offset="12400042">In your view did the 1055 statute change the law in any respect, or was it just precatory?</text>

            <text syncTime="3073.774" offset="12431389">I think the '55 law changed the procedures and the substantive law significantly.</text>

            <text syncTime="3110.213" offset="12577152">You earlier said you thought it was a substantial change in the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3121.319" offset="12621560">Purely procedure, no change in the substantive criteria, though?</text>

            <label>Mr. Clay Riggs Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="3124.871" offset="12635771">--Well, to the extent that it required the Board to determine that, for example, a prisoner's release was in the best interests of society, I suppose under prior law it could have determined that a release was not in the best interests of society but the prison was too overcrowded so it was going to release the prisoner anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.017" offset="12716437">Under the new law, of course, that discretion is minimized, so there may have been some incremental change in discretion but it certainly bears no logical relationship to whether the statute creates a reasonable expectation of release.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.944" offset="12776101">That, we believe, is the controlling standard in this case, Your Honor.</text>
