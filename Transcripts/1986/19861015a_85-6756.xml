            <text syncTime="90.691" offset="508674">Mr. Hitchcock was sentenced to death by a process that precluded the consideration of compelling mitigating evidence, and the reason for that was that he was sentenced to death in February of 1977 in Florida, during the period of time when the Florida death penalty statute stood most authoritatively construed and enforced to restrict the consideration of mitigating factors strictly to a narrow statutory list.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="157.452" offset="775750">Ordinarily, of course, we take the view of a Court of Appeals as to the law of a state in which that court sits.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="craig_s_barnard" startTime="166.391" stopTime="449.693">
            <label>Mr. Craig S. Barnard</label>
            <text syncTime="166.391" offset="811486">The same Court of Appeals had previously expressed the view that the Florida statute was limited, at least after the Cooper decision in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.882" offset="861432">It was in this case that they said that there was some ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.701" offset="876792">And I think that, looking at the law of Florida at the time, there can be very little question that the statute was interpreted to restrict the consideration of mitigating factors to the statute in the same manner as Ohio, for the same reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.683" offset="964668">And the restriction of mitigating factors violates the most basic Eighth Amendment principle applicable to capital sentencing enforced by this Court, and that is the need for individualization, individualized considerations of the unique factors in a particular case, in deciding whether someone should live or die.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.333" offset="1075322">The constitutional question that's presented in this case in essentially three areas, or the effect is seen in three ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.141" offset="1114506">The first that we... I'd like to mention the three first:</text>
            <text syncTime="246.926" offset="1133628">The first concerns the constitutionality of the statute, just as in Lockett, during this period of time;--</text>
            <text syncTime="257.483" offset="1175841">Second, that the effect of that unconstitutionality can be seen in this case from the trial record on its face;--</text>
            <text syncTime="268.423" offset="1219623">And finally, that counsel, defense counsel in this case, was restricted in the presentation of mitigating factors by reasonable adherence to that statute, with the result of this process that the sentencer in this case did not know James Ernest Hitchcock when it came to decide whether he should live or die.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.026" offset="1338010">With regard to the statute's unconstitutionality at the time, it's quite clear now and it was then that Florida was in a closely parallel position to Ohio at the time of Furman.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.176" offset="1434663">Florida, as Ohio, passed its capital sentencing statute for the reason or with the intent to meet the then-perceived requirement of Furman versus Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.225" offset="1530793">This was... at the time the contemporary commentators all recognized this, including those advising the legislature, the Florida legislature, and this intent to limit the consideration of mitigating factors to the statute was borne out and made very clear in 1976 when the Florida Supreme Court announced its decision in Cooper versus State.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.978" offset="1645837">In Cooper, the court spoke with uncommon clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.215" offset="1670810">The court there said that: mitigating factors in our statute are limited to the statute; evidence concerning other matters has no, no place in the capital sentencing in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.795" offset="1753148">The language cannot be misconstrued.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.680" offset="1768612">It is clear and direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.716" offset="1780837">And that, incidentally, is the period of time when this case was tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.020" offset="1806019">This case was tried in February 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.590" offset="1828276">So the Florida statute restricted the sentencer in making the difficult determination as to whether to impose the death sentence or not strictly to the narrow list of mitigating factors, in the same way as the Ohio statute, the Ohio legislature, had done with its statute and several other states had done.</text>

            <text syncTime="449.693" offset="1944677">Well, Mr. Barnard, in this case I take it the defense counsel did offer mitigating evidence that went beyond the purely statutory mitigating factors?</text>

            <text syncTime="466.019" offset="2009983">And how is a reviewing court to determine whether other mitigating evidence would have been obtained or offered?</text>
            <text syncTime="478.295" offset="2059094">How would we ever know as a reviewing court anything like that?</text>
            <text syncTime="484.282" offset="2083022">Because the attorney clearly didn't feel restricted at the time, having introduced some evidence that went beyond the mitigating factors.</text>

          <turn speaker="craig_s_barnard" startTime="495.305" stopTime="580.744">
            <label>Mr. Craig S. Barnard</label>
            <text syncTime="495.305" offset="2127117">Perhaps I should take a moment, because that is the Respondent's chief contention here as concerns the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.661" offset="2156583">I think we need to... I need to be clear as to the relevancy of presenting or having non-statutory mitigating factors in the record, in the trial record itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.467" offset="2203812">We have to look at it both legally and factually.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.337" offset="2219277">First, legally, the fact that there are non-statutory... evidence on non-statutory mitigating factors in the record, is not the key or central constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.347" offset="2271312">There were non-statutory mitigating facts in the record in Lockett and in Eddings and in Skipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.536" offset="2312063">But that was not the determinant fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.905" offset="2325543">The determinative issue there was whether that evidence could be given independent mitigating weight, could be considered on its own as a reason calling for a life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.032" offset="2394088">So, first I would question just the relevancy under the Court's Eighth Amendment standard with regard to those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.340" offset="2443303">It doesn't matter if the facts couldn't be considered under the process of the section.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="580.744" stopTime="603.393">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="580.744" offset="2468903">Well, if that isn't the key, as you put it, to the constitutional question, what is the key to the constitutional question?</text>
            <text syncTime="587.600" offset="2496383">I mean, if one were to show that a defense attorney had gotten in all the evidence that he wanted to get in, would it make much difference what the state supreme court said the trial court might have excluded if the trial court didn't exclude anything?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="craig_s_barnard" startTime="603.393" stopTime="652.024">
            <label>Mr. Craig S. Barnard</label>
            <text syncTime="603.393" offset="2559495">It has to do, Mr. Chief Justice, with what could be considered by the sentencer under the statutory framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.382" offset="2595440">In Eddings, the statute provided that all evidence of mitigation could be introduced, but it wasn't clear whether it was considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.207" offset="2646744">In Ohio, the Ohio legislature had liberally interpreted its statute to indicate that evidence not falling within the statute could be considered by the sentencer, but only as it bore upon statutory mitigating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.251" offset="2718947">So the prevailing plurality there spoke very clearly that the concern was whether it could be given indendent mitigating weight.</text>

            <text syncTime="667.802" offset="2817167">So in effect, everything the lawyer had said was washed out by the judge, just as though he had given the jury an instruction to disregard it.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.872" offset="2845379">So your contention is that it didn't get in for any effective purpose?</text>

            <text syncTime="1761.407" offset="7191528">First, we have shown just the overall sentencing disparity in Florida, that 57 percent of homicides involve white victims, 43 percent black victims, yet death sentences are imposed in 88 88 percent of the death sentences imposed involve white victims and 12 percent involve black victims.</text>

            <text syncTime="3536.991" offset="14293908">In order for a discriminatory impact to have taken place in our state, it has to go not only through the trial court level, but also through a mandated direct appeal and a proportionality review that is not even required under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.949" offset="14349706">Basically, the State of Florida bends over backwards to assure the propriety of its system.</text>
