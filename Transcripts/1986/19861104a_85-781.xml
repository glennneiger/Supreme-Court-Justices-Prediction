            <label>Mr. Richard K. Willard</label>
            <text syncTime="55.401" offset="366136">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="63.073" offset="396856">As this Court recognized in its unanimous opinion The Pocket Veto Case, the term "pocket veto" is something is a misnomer because it implies an affirmative act on the part of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.429" offset="438234">In fact, the pocket veto arises from Presidential inaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.500" offset="454535">If the President neither signs a bill nor returns it to Congress with his objections within 10 days, Sundays excepted, followed presentment, the last sentence of Article I, Section 7, Clause 2, spells out what happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.324" offset="505839">It says,</text>
            <text syncTime="91.374" offset="510019">"the Same shall be a law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="99.830" offset="543874">On November 18, 1983, Congress did two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.900" offset="560174">It presented H. R. 4042, an enrolled bill, to the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.769" offset="575638">And it adjourned its first session sine die.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.887" offset="588073">H.R. 4042 was met with Presidential inaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.756" offset="603642">The President neither signed it nor returned it to Congress with his objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.160" offset="621196">This suit was brought by the Congressional respondents to obtain a declaratory judgment that by operation of Article I, Section 7, Clause 2, H.R. 4042 became a law just as if the President had signed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.551" offset="674799">Now, it's important to recognize at the very outset that H.R. 4042 would have expired by its own terms on September 30th, 1984, one month after the judgment of the Court of Appeals was entered in this case, and more than six months before their opinions were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.929" offset="740314">The question of mootness ties in to the question of whether the Congressional respondents have standing on any theory to maintain this suit for declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.285" offset="773751">I should point out, however, that we have no doubt of the power of the courts to decide the meaning of the Pocket Veto Clause in a real case or controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.891" offset="808128">A person with legal rights under H.R. 4042 could sue to enforce those rights, and in the process, obtain a judicial determination as to whether or not 4042 is or is not a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.580" offset="850865">Such were the claims of the plaintiff Indian tribes in The Pocket Veto Case, or the individual claimant in Wright v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.369" offset="882002">Here, however, we have a completely different basis for standing asserted by the Congressional respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.356" offset="906035">They claim no substantive rights under H.R. 4042.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.475" offset="922440">Instead, their claim is that the failure of the executive branch to regard H.R. 4042 as a law has nullified their votes, thus creating judicially cognizable injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.616" offset="967057">Now there are two different ways that this injury of nullification has been explained.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.687" offset="991299">The original theory of the case was that the President nullified the votes of the Congressional respondents when he failed to carry out the substantive revisions of H.R. 4042, when he provided military aid to El Salvador without filing the requisite certifications about progress on human rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.714" offset="1059426">Now it's certainly clear that that theory of standing is completely moot, because H.R. 4042 has expired, and the law governing military aid to El Salvador is completely different, and is not affected by whether or not H.R. 4042 did or did not become a law.</text>

            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="246.360" offset="1129957">May I just ask you on that, what about the argument they make about some auditing consequences about whether compliance with the bill would have had fiscal consequences?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard K. Willard</label>
            <text syncTime="255.532" offset="1166737">Justice Stevens, it's our view that these collateral consequences, or asserted collateral consequences, do not involve the parties before the Court in this case, and thus, do not provide a basis for avoiding mootness; that the dispute would involve the Secretary of State, allegedly, or the Controller General, neither of whom are parties here.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.410" offset="1238208">And there's no indication that the Congressional respondents would be proper parties in that kind of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.397" offset="1258166">In any event, that kind of a collateral lawsuit, which we don't think is a basis for the... for a case here, would be one in which Congress would not have standing as well, because it would be a dispute over execution of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.055" offset="1308739">That's the problem, of course, with their broad theory as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.574" offset="1318874">That is, they assert that Members of Congress have a judicially cognizable interest in whether or not laws are faithfully executed after they pass them.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.430" offset="1350326">And--</text>

            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="302.047" offset="1352729">It seems to me that your argument... and you may be right, of course... that your argument on mootness really merges with your argument on standing, and that if you're right on mootness, it's because you're right on standing.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Richard K. Willard</label>
            <text syncTime="311.535" offset="1390659">--I think there is much truth to that, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.004" offset="1404556">And that's why in our reply brief we merge the two arguments together to talk about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.808" offset="1419811">I think there is an aspect in which they interrelate.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.391" offset="1430156">But setting aside the mootness issue, even if H.R. 4042 did not have a sunset provision and were still ongoing, their broad theory of standing, that Members of Congress can sue because laws are not being executed and thus, their votes are being nullified, is one which would be quite novel for this Court to recognize, and, we think, inconsistent with the Courts teaching in Chadha and Synar.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.357" offset="1525973">And that is, that Congress has an interest in the lawmaking process that ends once laws are made, and that they do not have an ongoing power to supervise the execution of the laws through some kind of extraconstitutional--</text>

            <text syncTime="364.753" offset="1603609">It did involve State legislatures, and that of course doesn't raise the same kind of separation of powers questions as we have when we have Congress, the U.S. courts, and the President involved.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard K. Willard</label>
            <text syncTime="377.245" offset="1653555">Well, in addition there's the different kind of standing involved there.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.465" offset="1674453">The legislators were dealing with an issue of whether their votes were being counted properly within the legislative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.487" offset="1706531">This case involves something different.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.606" offset="1714995">And that is, once the legislative process has come to an end, once they've passed a bill, whether or not the bill is being correct effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.776" offset="1743625">I think the distinction that the Court drew in the Bender case, in footnote 6, I believe it was... footnote 7... distinguishing Coleman in that case is apt here as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.901" offset="1792213">And that is that in Bender you had a situation where an individual board member was trying to pursue a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.822" offset="1819903">But it wasn't about whether or not his vote had been counted by the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.459" offset="1834427">It was whether or not the board's action should be given validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.078" offset="1844876">And that's the same kind of situation we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.328" offset="1853862">It's not like Powell v. McCormack, where someone is claiming a right to sit in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.148" offset="1873193">It's where the Congressional respondents are claiming some power once they passed a bill to have the executive act in some way with regard to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.004" offset="1912585">And that, we think, in addition distinguishes Coleman.</text>

            <text syncTime="1021.977" offset="4232468">And for those reasons, Congress need never allow the pocket veto to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.114" offset="4253052">As this Court observed in The Pocket Veto Case, pocket vetoes are not the President's fault, but instead, are attributable solely to the action of Congress in adjourning before the time allowed the President for returning the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.355" offset="4297983">Now, much has been made of the fact that many bills are in fact presented to the President shortly before an adjournment in the modern practice of Congress, and that therefore, allowing the President's pocket veto power to be exercised would give... would allow a lot of these bills to be absolutely vetoed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.467" offset="4370394">But that's really a static-state analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.836" offset="4379903">That's assuming that Congress would handle its adjournment and bill presentment practices exactly the same without regard to how the Pocket Veto Clause is construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.024" offset="4420654">Congress has the power, under existing practices, to control the presentment of bills, and to control adjournments, so if it doesn't want to allow the Pocket Veto Clause to apply, it can avoid it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.165" offset="4469242">Moreover, even if a bill is pocket vetoed, it's not that drastic, because it can be reenacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.538" offset="4498708">If in fact two-thirds of each House is interested in overriding a Presidential veto, then obtaining reenactment by a simple majority in each House, and representment to the President when they reconvene, should not be that much of a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.697" offset="4555341">The main... the position of the respondents about how the pocket veto should operate is, that the President should be required, when Congress has adjourned between or within sessions, to return a bill with his objections to an agent who will hold the President's message, and then present it to the originating House of Congress when it returns and reconvenes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.944" offset="4640291">We have no doubt that this kind of a rule could work, or that it would not drastically alter the balance of power in the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.615" offset="4667041">But it's a rule that has been repeatedly rejected by the framers of the Constitution, by Presidents and Congresses since the administration of James Madison, and by this Court, unanimously, in The Pocket Veto Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.822" offset="4711867">Turning first to the framers, the Court on several occasions has recognized that the New York Constitution of 1777 provided the model for what turned out to be Article I, Section 7, the process of enacting legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.480" offset="4762440">The first draft of this article, like the Constitution of New York of 1777, provided that if the legislature by adjourning prevented a return veto, that the bill should be returned on the first-day of the next meeting of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.871" offset="4820014">In practice, essentially the rule the respondents argue for in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.025" offset="4840703">And yet, for whatever reason, the Committee of Detail rejected this approach, and instead, provided that when a bill could not be returned to Congress because of adjournment, that it would not become law, rather than being held over and presented to Congress... returned to Congress when it reconvened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.486" offset="4906531">This is the construction that's been given to this clause by Presidents throughout our history, going back to James Madison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.890" offset="4936102">A total of 272 bills have been pocket vetoed after sine die adjournments of Congress in our country's history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.429" offset="4966300">Only three have ever been returned to Congress after sine die adjournments prior to the Court of Appeals' decision in this case, two by President Ford and one by President Carter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.852" offset="5007991">Finally, this Court's decision in The Pocket Veto Case, where the Court unanimously adopted the construction of the Pocket Veto Clause that we're urging today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.676" offset="5047279">Given this long history of a settled interpretation of the Pocket Veto Clause, and the evidence of the drafting history it went through, it's our contention that the application made by the Court of Appeals in this case is an unjustified departure from a well settled rule for determining this kind of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.073" offset="5128886">Unless there are any further questions from the Court, I'll conclude my argument for now.</text>

            <text syncTime="1261.249" offset="5189594">When the Court last examined the Constitution's veto provision, in the Wright case, it said that those provisions should be interpreted to further two equal purposes: one, protecting the President's ability to veto messages; and two, protecting Congress' ability to override vetoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.711" offset="5263364">The pocket veto that was used in this case damaged the framers' plan for allocating the lawmaking responsibility by extinguishing Congress' opportunity to override a veto, without it being necessary for the President to accomplish the veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.154" offset="5325222">Notwithstanding this inappropriate use of the pocket veto, the executives claim that plaintiffs lack standing and thereby, that the Court is prohibited from granting relief in this lawsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1314.282" offset="5401709">Plaintiffs, the Houses and Members of Congress, sued two executive officers, the acting Archivist of the United States, and the Executive Clerk of the White House, because those officers failed to perform duties, required by statute, to publish all duly enacted laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="1416.180" offset="5809323">And that is what this Court decided in the Coleman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.131" offset="5821131">It found in the Coleman case that a bloc of Kansas legislators had standing because they had a plain, direct and adequate interest in maintaining the effectiveness of their votes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1770.105" offset="7224951">It was a constitutional claim that he had been appointed, and he sought the performance of the ministerial act that would vindicate his right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.128" offset="7253059">And the Court found that the delivery of the commission would vindicate that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.215" offset="7277405">Similarly, the Court has held in a number of other cases that institutions of government or officers of government have standing to adjudicate infringements of their official power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.792" offset="7335710">And it's found that in cases brought by State governments against the Federal government; in cases brought by one entity of the Federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.112" offset="7364967">The executive's attempt is a novel attempt to write an absolute rule that bars all infringements to official power, and render all of those automatically noncognizable under the separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.538" offset="7422750">But the cases that the Court... the cases in which the Court has adjudicated infringements demonstrate that there can be no such per se rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1903.978" offset="7760461">The fact that this controversy resulted from Congress' enactment of a law distinguishes it from other kinds of disputes that are appropriately resolved by political processes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2288.087" offset="9296879">So what that kind of rule would require is not that Congress would call its adjournment by a different name, but that it change its schedule and remain in session for a period of 10 days or more, because it takes awhile for bills to be presented to the President, in order to ensure that the President will return a bill to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.417" offset="9382247">And the Constitution simply does not require the Congress to take various strategic and evasive actions in order to implement the plan that was the purpose behind these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.606" offset="9422998">The Constitution provides language adequate to face the need of the President, to be able to ensure that he can veto a bill; and the right of Congress, as long as they've given that opportunity, to determine whether to override by two-thirds vote.</text>

            <text syncTime="2414.584" offset="9802923">But I believe the court cases and the separation of powers values underlying demonstrate that there is cognizable injury in an infringement such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.856" offset="9840017">Turning then to the merits, the Constitution says, Article I, Section 7, Clause 2, that</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.795" offset="9871782">"if any Bill shall not be return by the President within ten Days. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.330" offset="9885888">then the bill shall be a law in the same manner as if he had signed it,</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.615" offset="9903025">"unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.103" offset="9928938">The only thing stopping a bill from becoming a law, according to the text, is if, by adjourning, Congress prevents the bill's return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.209" offset="9961434">And then the President can pocket it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.994" offset="9968540">The plain words of the clause shoe that this bill became a law because the President could have returned the bill to the originating house and he didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.682" offset="10003335">The fact that Congress was in an adjournment at the time is irrelevant is long as the adjournment is not on that prevents return of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.205" offset="10037398">This textual reading of the clause is confirmed by an examination of the purpose of the pocket Veto provision in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.061" offset="10072820">The pocket veto implements the framers fundamental decision about the placement of legislative responsibility; and that was the determination to give the president only the qualified power to arrest the enactment of laws by returning them to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.238" offset="10133529">The framers determined that the President would have the power to return unacceptable bills, but that Congress must have the power to override the president's objections if two-thirds of its Members were not persuaded by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.628" offset="10187028">The pocket veto was adopted solely to guarantee adherence to this distribution of the lawmaking power, by ensuring that Congress could not provide the President of the opportunity to exercise a veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.221" offset="10241467">If Congress were to adjourn out from under the President, depriving him of the chance of vetoing, he could simply pocket the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.209" offset="10269366">Thus the pocket veto was intended as a defensive mechanism solely to guarantee that the President would retain the ability to effect the veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.081" offset="10304892">The attempt to pocket veto this bill during an interim adjournment of the Congress failed to respect the purpose of the provision and the plan of the framers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.705" offset="10347420">During this adjournment, each House had assigned to an officer the duty to accept veto messages from the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.526" offset="10374691">The purpose of doing that was precisely to assure that by adjourning Congress would not prevent the President from returning a till.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.715" offset="10403426">Thus, the decision to pocket this bill was a decision to use a pocket veto in lieu of a constitutionally available alternative of a return veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.654" offset="10443132">By so doing, the Congress was deprived of the opportunity to repass the bill, while the executive in no way needed to use the pocket veto to maintain its ability to veto the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.211" offset="10493392">The executive argues, in defense of this use of the pocket veto, that the Constitution bars Congress from using officers to receive vetoes whenever it is adjourned for longer than three days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.971" offset="10548458">They call three days the constitutionally prescribed dividing line, identifying those adjournments that prevent return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.559" offset="10578760">But the Constitution does not say that a bill becomes law unless Congress has adjourned, or unless Congress has adjourned for more than three days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.433" offset="10626303">The framers could have adopted either of those formulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.568" offset="10638842">But instead, they provided that a bill that the President has not acted upon becomes law unless the Congress, by their adjournment, prevent the bill's return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.276" offset="10677712">With this language, the framers understood that some adjournments would prevent return, and that others would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.096" offset="10704984">And they declined to set up rigid categories to attempt to control in advance which adjournments would be deemed to prevent return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.202" offset="10737376">Instead of such a fixed rule, like the one that the executive argues for here, the framers wrote into the Constitution a conditional rule, using the word "prevent", so that their rule could adapt as Congress' practices developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.461" offset="10794427">This understanding is consistent with the Court's decision in The Pocket Veto Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.532" offset="10822744">In that case, the Court decided that an adjournment during the 69th Congress did prevent the President from returning a bill because, at the time, there was no practice of Congress appointing officers; no practice of accepting bills from the President, vetoed bills from the President, during an adjournment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.427" offset="10898290">But practices since then have changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.362" offset="10909993">The Congress now meets much longer during the year; takes a number of short breaks throughout its meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.016" offset="10932667">In keeping with this contemporary development, the Congress now arranges for the receipt of messages from the President while it is not sitting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.288" offset="10965686">The executive relies on dictum in The Pocket Veto Case that said that Constitution was not permitted... does not permit Congress to use agents to accept veto messages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.513" offset="11014587">But the executive ignores that several years later, in the Wright case, this Court expressly disapproved that language, and said that the Constitution does not define what shall constitute a return of a bill, or deny the use of appropriate agencies in effecting the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.808" offset="11087834">The Court noted in Wright that both the Congress and the President use agents to perform their duties in the lawmaking process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.580" offset="11122838">The Congress does not troop down to the White House en masse to present bills to the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.317" offset="11145826">It uses an agent to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.717" offset="11151469">The President, for his part, does not accept bills personally, even though the Constitution says bills must be presented to the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.690" offset="11187309">Rather, the Executive Clerk of the White House accepts bills on the President's behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.494" offset="11206535">On the bill's return trip up Capitol Hill as well, the text of the Constitution, he, the President, shall return bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.866" offset="11244047">But the President doesn't return bills personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.385" offset="11254078">He gives them to his Executive Clerk, and the clerk delivers them to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.706" offset="11271423">There's no reason in the Constitution why the Clerk of the President should be barred constitutionally from delivering vetoed bills to the Clerk of the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.477" offset="11314473">The Court of Appeals properly performed its task of integrating this Court's decisions in The Pocket Veto Case and in Wright, and in determining that during this adjournment, there was no problem with the President using the available means to return a bill to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.808" offset="11399841">As Judge McGowan wrote for the Court, there was no problem that there would be uncertainty if the President were to use this vehicle as to whether or not he had vetoed a bill; and there was no problem of undue delay before Congress could have determined whether it wished to override the veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.084" offset="11468909">The executive maintains that this adjournment was... prevented return of a bill because Congress couldn't consider the President's objections and whether to override until after it returned several weeks later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.593" offset="11522930">But the Constitution does not say that Congress must immediately reconsider a bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.147" offset="11545186">It says it shall proceed to reconsider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.266" offset="11553650">As the Court of Appeals noted, the Constitution sets no time limit on Congress' exercise of its power to override a return veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.122" offset="11589072">There is no basis in the Constitution for the executive's attempt to elevate the value of rapid return and reconsideration in override of a bill over the fundamental goal of the Constitution to ensure that Congress would have an opportunity to override by a vote of two-thirds on its own schedule, if it wished to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.535" offset="11674754">The executive position would argue for a vast reallocation of the lawmaking power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.289" offset="11701712">By setting the rule at three days, the executive maintains that every adjournment of four or five days, for example, for a long holiday weekend, precludes the Congress constitutionally from accepting return of a bill, and accordingly, prohibits use of a return veto with the possibility of an override.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.936" offset="11780288">The executive makes this argument in spite of the fact that in recent years, Presidents, including President Reagan, have returned a number of bills to Congress during adjournments by delivering to agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.577" offset="11826891">President Reagan has returned more than one-third of his bills in precisely that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.545" offset="11846744">The executive's argument would require the finding that the Constitution in fact required that all of those bills be pocketed instead, and that Congress be deprived of the opportunity to override vetoes by a two-thirds vote whenever it has adjourned for more than three days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.324" offset="11917901">The executive is essentially taking the constitutional framework intended to distribute power between the branches and reading it as a technical manual of administrative procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.382" offset="11958130">In the course of that, the executive is perfectly willing to sacrifice the plan of mutual checks that is... was the dominant purpose behind these provisions of the Constitution.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard K. Willard</label>
            <text syncTime="2973.009" offset="12036602">Mr. Chief Justice, the only point I wanted to make was on the question about return to an agent, which I think is something of a red herring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.365" offset="12070038">It is not at all our position that the President has to personally traipse up Capitol Hill, bill in hand, and hand it to Congress while they're all sitting in session to receive it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.505" offset="12114551">Our point is, though, that the Constitution when it provides for the return of bills to Congress with objections has something in mind other than... this is what the pocket veto Court had... giving it to an agent who can hold it for weeks or months and then present it to Congress when they return.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.384" offset="12182051">The Constitution in Article I, Section 7... describes how a President should return a bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.455" offset="12210368">It says he shall return it with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated who shall enter the objections at large on their journal and proceed to reconsider it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.061" offset="12244850">Now, we have no quarrel with the practice of handing it to an agent, as the Wright Court said, during a brief, three day or less recess, because then Congress can immediately... or within a short period of time... enter it on their journal and proceed to reconsider it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.605" offset="12319038">What the pocket veto Court held, and what the Wright Court did not overrule, was that allowing a bill to remain in a state of suspended animation... and that was the Court's language in both Pocket Veto and Wright... for days or weeks or months during an adjournment is not what the Constitution had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.317" offset="12389882">That's what the New York Constitution of 1777 provided for, but the framers deliberately rejected that kind of model, and instead, provided for a different set of rules to govern the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.422" offset="12434290">So our position, then, is not to be confused with the question about whether or not agents can be used, but about whether or not, when Congress has adjourned for a period of days or weeks or months, whether or not a return veto must be attempted and then held in a state of suspended animation until they return, or whether in fact the Pocket Veto Clause indicates the legislative process has to start over from scratch at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.490" offset="12534496">That was the only point I wanted to make, Mr. Chief Justice, unless the Court has an additional question.</text>
