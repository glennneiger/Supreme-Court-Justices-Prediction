          <turn speaker="stephen_h_sachs" startTime="51.349" stopTime="472.218">
            <label>Mr. Stephen H. Sachs</label>
            <text syncTime="51.349" offset="356938">Thank you very much Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, we are here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Maryland which reversed the conviction of respondent Garrison because in the judgment of the Maryland Court of Appeals the evidence necessary to sustain that conviction was the product of an unconstitutional search of respondent Garrison's apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.964" offset="455472">The search and seizure warrant in question issued by a District Court judge, state judge in Baltimore issued for the person of one Lawrence McWebb, a suspected marijuana dealer, and his premises, 2036 Park Avenue, third floor apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.045" offset="535720">It was issued, we believe respondent concedes, with ample probable cause for McWebb and for that search.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.799" offset="562783">It was issued, however, on the assumption and executed on the assumption that only one apartment existed on the third floor at 2036 Park Avenue and it was the apartment of McWebb.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.173" offset="604266">It turned out that that assumption was, in the words of Hill v. California, quite wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.593" offset="629970">There were two apartments, one McWebb's, the other Garrison's, and the question before the Court is whether the police behavior here in this case falls within the margin for reasonable error allowable by the Fourth Amendment as recognized in the opinions of this Court like Hill against California, in Brineger, and in others.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.025" offset="719623">We submit that the conduct of the police here clearly does fall within that reasonableness standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.096" offset="747939">It is helpful, we think, Your Honors, to analyze what the police did here in three separate stages, the investigation stage which led to the obtaining and issuance of the warrant, the arrival at 2036 Park Avenue, arrival at the premises, and finally the entry into the third floor premises themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.724" offset="822440">Each of these stages reinforced, we submit, the assumption at the beginning that there was one apartment on the third floor and it was McWebb's, and each of these stages, we also submit, Your Honors, was dominated by a crucial fact, an overwhelming fact, a central fact that categorized, characterized each stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.506" offset="909585">In the first stage the verification from the public utility, the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company, that there was only one apartment on the third floor, that was McWebb's.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.862" offset="946992">At the second stage it was the arrival of McWebb himself, the very subject of the... intended subject of the search, who arrived on the scene fortuitously.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.135" offset="980116">He had been out of his apartment, came to the scene, and in effect led the officers up the stairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.920" offset="995267">And finally, in the third stage, it was the appearance of the premises once the police went through the door, which we suggest gave the appearance for all the world that this is one apartment and only one apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.228" offset="1040511">Now, the facts begin with a tip from an informant of Officer Marcus that the informant had been buying marijuana for a long time, I believe, six months from someone he knew as Red Cross, street name Red Cross, from his apartment on the third floor of 2036 Park Avenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.106" offset="1111982">The informant said nothing about the existence on that floor of two separate apartments.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.158" offset="1128178">The informant, had bought marijuana as recently as the day before Officer Marcus proceeds to get his affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.497" offset="1165585">Officer Marcus then does an eminently reasonable thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.548" offset="1177706">He checks with... first, he looks at the premises, sees that it is a three-story brick building with 2036 on the outside, which the informant had said, and then he checks with the public utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.222" offset="1212501">He calls up the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company to find out who lived on the third floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.660" offset="1238205">All he had was the street name, Red Cross.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.510" offset="1245624">And he recites in his affidavit for the warrant that he called and he discovered, he says the word 2036, third floor, was in the name of Lawrence McWebb.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.568" offset="1293794">He on examination at the motion to suppress... Officer Marcus says he expressly asked Baltimore Gas and Electric Company, was there a front and a middle and a back, or words very much to that effect, and "They told me", and this is a quote from Marcus in the suppression hearing, "They told me", he says,</text>
            <text syncTime="302.180" offset="1360249">"one third floor was only listed to Lawrence McWebb. "</text>
            <text syncTime="305.648" offset="1374147">not perhaps the most grammatical or artful expression of what we think the evidence is clear it meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.468" offset="1401418">What he was saying was, there is only one guy who lives there, there is only one apartment, it is McWebb--</text>
            <text syncTime="317.104" offset="1420018">McWebb to the informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.074" offset="1443841">He says that is Red Cross.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.110" offset="1448021">And Marcus gets his warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.727" offset="1458470">It is difficult, may I suggest at this stage, Your Honor, to imagine a police officer acting more reasonably under the precedents of this court and the preference for the warrant requirement and the reasons for it in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.600" offset="1501938">Of course, he could have done more.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.285" offset="1508729">He could have checked with the phone company, I suppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.321" offset="1516880">He could have made supplementary checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.571" offset="1525866">But the mistake here was the mistake, we suggest, of BG&amp;E.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.689" offset="1542271">It was not the mistake of the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.839" offset="1546868">His reliance on that mistake was appropriate and was consistent with the informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.843" offset="1570901">There was no reason to question, and the BG&amp;E was indeed the verification, as the Court of Special Appeals in this case held, the verification of the information that he needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.116" offset="1607995">Stage Two is the arrival at the premises, 2036, of the police raiding party.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.304" offset="1632759">While Officer Shea, one of the first officer on the scene, was examining the outside door to the premises, the exterior door that led to the street, and was trying to gain entry into that door without breaking it down... at one point he said he punched all seven bells to try to get somebody to press the release buzzer... so he could get in without breaking down the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.670" offset="1734218">While that is going on... and incidentally he testified and the Court found as a fact that McWebb's name was at none of those bells... while that is going on, who should arrive but McWebb himself, by vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.228" offset="1780507">He is detained, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.930" offset="1787299">He is informed of the search warrant, of course, and what then happens is, he leads the raiding party... his key is used to open the exterior door.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.083" offset="1819900">He leads the raiding party up the... into the first floor, onto the second floor landing, onto the third floor, and it is his key that opens the door to the third floor apartment as it appeared to the police at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.427" offset="1873294">Significantly, on the way up and throughout this entire episode McWebb never says, my apartment is third floor rear.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.581" offset="1901925">Never does he indicate that there are two apartments.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.014" offset="1911642">Never, as we will see in a moment, does Garrison so indicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.449" offset="1921360">But as they are going up these stairs the police are also seeing on the first and the second floor, the evidence shows, doors leading from the landings to what must have appeared to them to be apartments, but when they get to the third floor, this is not the lady and the tiger.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.327" offset="1984889">We are not here talking about options that the police have.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.577" offset="1993876">There is one door and one door only on the third floor appearing for all the world to them to be the door of the apartment of the man McWebb who is the subject of the search who is now leading them into the premises itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.718" offset="2038388">There is an interesting--</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="472.218" offset="2040478">Unlike the appearances on the first and second floors.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_h_sachs" startTime="474.634" stopTime="778.430">
            <label>Mr. Stephen H. Sachs</label>
            <text syncTime="474.634" offset="2050091">--Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.420" offset="2053226">Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.103" offset="2055943">Officer Marcus... Shea does not recall in his testimony, Your Honor, whether there were or were not doors on the other floors, but Officer Marcus expressly, and we cite the references at Page 10 of our reply brief, expressly talks about there being "other doors", "a lot of doors".</text>
            <text syncTime="492.113" offset="2119995">I think he is talking about the second floor in particular, perhaps the first, but certainly the third.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.565" offset="2137863">I think he is talking mostly the second floor, options, but on the third one door and one door only.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.484" offset="2157507">In an exchange between counsel for Garrison, the respondent, and Officer Shea at the motion to suppress counsel says, well, didn't it occur to you, officer, that as you got to the third floor there might be more than one apartment?</text>
            <text syncTime="515.792" offset="2214767">Shea replies, not when I saw that one door, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.111" offset="2232008">It is also important, we suggest, Your Honors, to remember this in analyzing this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.182" offset="2252279">This is not a situation in which the police should have been expected to ask as they were proceeding, should we, shouldn't we.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.919" offset="2279237">This was not analysis of where are we each stage of the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.073" offset="2299822">They had a valid warrant as far as they knew.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.540" offset="2309748">They were proceeding up the stairs with the very subject of that warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.977" offset="2323436">There was not a reason for them to be self-examining their conduct because nothing had gone off to alert them of the need to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.315" offset="2356873">And so here we have at Stage Two the arrival at the moment of truth with... led by the very subject of the search itself, and now we come through the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.189" offset="2400341">It is the key of McWebb that allows them to come in, although Officer Marcus recalled that he thought Garrison himself might have opened the door, but what they see when they come in further ratifies and reinforces the assumption that they had been making from the beginning, the validity of this warrant for the one apartment on the third floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.900" offset="2475156">On the right... they enter a tiny foyer, four by five feet, as I think the description... at the appendix in our petition for certiorari is a diagram, Appendix Page 44 in the petition for certiorari, but what they see... they are in this small, tiny foyer, and to their right they see an open doorway with a bedroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.384" offset="2573063">To their left they see an open doorway with a livingroom, and no doors were visible.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.538" offset="2601693">That is a finding of fact of the trial court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.907" offset="2611201">No doors were visible.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.357" offset="2616948">In fact, as it turns out there were doors to those two, doorways, the bedroom and the livingroom, but they were wide open, and they opened inward, and the evidence is, as I say, the court found as a fact that no doors were visible.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.552" offset="2677761">May I also add at this point, Your Honors, that it is not unreasonable that it should have seemed to them to be one premises occupied by a common... one apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.093" offset="2727916">It is, after all, and as a matter of record in this case, that this had been a building, as many buildings on that block are, this had been 3 building that had been a one-family building.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.865" offset="2766996">This building was built for one family and had been broken down into apartments, but I suggest to you that you should not have in your mind the notion of some corridor with doors going off to various apartments.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.690" offset="2814329">So you have only the two doors, and the two doors are wide open, with no doors visible at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.994" offset="2839512">The doorways are wide open.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.196" offset="2844318">And to and behold, directly in front of them, not in what turned out to be his apartment, not even in the bedroom that they saw on their right, but directly in front of them is the respondent Garrison.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.836" offset="2890920">He is in pajamas, and he is in a body cast because he had had recent spinal surgery.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.721" offset="2910460">He is asked to identify himself, and he does.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.423" offset="2921223">He is silent with respect to, wait a minute, now, I am a neighbor here, this is not... what are you doing here in my place.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.446" offset="2957376">He is absolutely silent on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.965" offset="2963436">He is detained, and taken off to the livingroom thing that I described on the left, and the police at this moment see, as they are into this tiny car, they see marijuana on the bureau in the bedroom, what they think is marijuana on the bureau in the bedroom of Garrison.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.141" offset="3020174">The very thing they had the probable cause to believe was being sold by McWebb from his apartment they now see in a bedroom on a bureau five, six feet away from where they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.782" offset="3066672">It is reasonable, it is reasonable, we suggest, and that is the standard and, we suggest, the only standard that needs apply here, for the police to have assumed that Garrison was a housemate, Garrison was a roommate, Garrison was a convalescing cousin come to call.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.725" offset="3134486">He was not a neighbor who had some independent living arrangement over there.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.529" offset="3153712">Now, there were other indicia that developed in the course of this episode that are more ambiguous in terms of the timing, but they cut very much in favor of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.920" offset="3203240">The phone in Garrison's bedroom on the right rings.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.872" offset="3223094">It is a phone call for Red Cross, McWebb.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.674" offset="3234274">Clothes are found hanging on what was the exterior door to Garrison's apartment, the one on the right.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gerald A. Kroop</label>
            <text syncTime="1519.534" offset="6229683">Mr. Chief Justice, and Honorable Justices of the Court, good afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.236" offset="6244520">This case, and this Court has struggled for over 70 years in a very deep, dramatic, and using legal minds throughout these years to try and balance what we are trying to do today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.428" offset="6301258">On the one side we want that Fourth Amendment where it says the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures to still be viable, but on the other hand we do not want to handcuff the police to such an extent that it is going to frustrate them and deter them the opposite way from going ahead and trying to ferret out criminals and be brought to justice by using evidence that is recovered against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.813" offset="6410868">Now, in this great back and forth stress ever since Weeks to the present time, many positions have been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.983" offset="6439498">As a defense lawyer my heyday was back in the Warren Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.953" offset="6459352">Today I find it a much more difficult uphill battle the way the Court is leaning, but that is fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.571" offset="6477846">We have to adjust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.555" offset="6481817">But the Court is still desperately trying to strike this balance, and I think if you step back from what the Court has done, I think the Court very clearly during its period of time over this 70 some years has said that warrantless searches, and you still say warrantless searches are per se unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.270" offset="6568648">The touchstone of the Fourth Amendment indeed is reasonable because the Fourth Amendment says the right of the people to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.126" offset="6604070">So the question is, is this an unreasonable search, and we submit without any equivocation it is, because it was indeed a warrantless search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.398" offset="6641164">To say that they had a warrant for Garrison's apartment would be just picking themselves up by its own bootstraps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.318" offset="6668854">If, for instance, the police would have gone with a warrant into the wrong place first and then they discovered it, went into the right place, nobody would have a problem with that because the warrant indeed was for McWebb.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.911" offset="6731234">If the police didn't really know where to go, and there was, say, only one apartment, and nothing was seized from Garrison because it said McWebb, and as Justice White pointed out, the affidavit clearly says McWebb and third floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.488" offset="6781494">An inference is there, What is the inference?</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.671" offset="6790271">The person to be seized is that person who lives at that apartment on the third floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.892" offset="6811169">So this indeed was a warrantless search.</text>

            <text syncTime="3130.852" offset="12674927">--Suppose it was perfectly clear there were two apartments on the third floor and everybody knew it at the time the warrant was issued, but all you knew was that drugs were being sold out of the third floor, and everybody concedes there was probable cause to believe that drugs were being sold out of the third floor, but they didn't know which apartment, and the warrant then authorized the search of both apartments.</text>

            <text syncTime="3160.204" offset="12792374">It doesn't sound to me in your hypothetical, Mr. Justice, that you have described sufficient probable cause to enter two different... two persons' places just because one of them... this is the lady and the tiger... just because one of them is likely to be dealing drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.298" offset="12852769">That is not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.781" offset="12858725">This case is bottomed on the assumption, reasonable, we say, that only McWebb lived on that floor and there was only one apartment on that floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.737" offset="12890489">If we are wrong about that, if that was unreasonable, then the Court of Appeals was right, but for the wrong reasons, because it never asked the question, nor did it analyze it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.510" offset="12921627">In asking ourselves this question, Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, we posited the Halloween prank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.497" offset="12949526">Suppose that the numbers on all the doors in the 20 hundred block of Park Avenue were changed, reasonably, looking good, so that an objective observer couldn't tell the difference, and the police simply went to the wrong house and found heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.339" offset="13004906">That is a terrible intrusion on the innocent victims... not so innocent in terms of heroin, but innocent in terms of any probable cause of that search, and we come to the conclusion, and I hope by using this hypothetical I make the right assumption about what this Court would do, there is nothing the police did wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.151" offset="13076168">There is nothing unreasonable about their conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.253" offset="13088602">That is Hill, and that is this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.372" offset="13101036">Thank you very much.</text>
