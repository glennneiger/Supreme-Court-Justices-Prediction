            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="141796">Ms. Wilson, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Ms. Anne Owings Wilson</label>
            <text syncTime="68.727" offset="416604">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="74.898" offset="441368">This case is on appeal from a decision of the Arkansas Supreme Court which upheld the validity of the application of the Arkansas sales tax to sales of Arkansas Times Magazine when newspapers and certain types of magazines are exempt from taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.010" offset="517750">The Arkansas Times Magazine is a monthly city and regional type of magazine, very similar to this city's Washingtonian.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.817" offset="557038">It's distributed throughout the state of Arkansas, has a distribution of between 25 and 30,000, four fifths of which are through subscription sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.125" offset="602283">It has articles on a variety of topics.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.077" offset="614090">It has short stories, articles on politics, religion, fashions, food, leisure activities, other articles of that type.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.199" offset="658498">It does have articles on sports, religion, professional things, and so forth, and I mention that particularly because that's one category of publications that the Arkansas sales tax exempts from taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.011" offset="733835">There are two exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.195" offset="742508">First of all, the Arkansas sales tax is imposed generally on sales of tangible personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.849" offset="773123">There are two exemptions which are particularly apropos.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.468" offset="787647">One is exemption (f), which exempts all gross receipts or gross proceeds from the sale of newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.740" offset="816696">The other one is exemption (j), which exempts religious, professional, trade, and sports journals, and/or publications printed and published within the state when sold through regular subscriptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.750" offset="876777">Now, just from reading exemption (j) one would think that that might extent to cover all publications printed and published within the state of Arkansas, and in fact that's what the chancellor who first heard the case found.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.657" offset="928395">But the Department of Revenue appealed the case to the Arkansas Supreme Court, and the Arkansas Supreme Court construed exemption (j) extremely narrowly, finding that it only exempted sales of religious, sports, professional, and trade journals.</text>

          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="216.238" stopTime="243.705">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="216.238" offset="1006658">While we're on the subject of the lower court's holding, I think that I understand the lower courts here to have held that under Arkansas law even the non-subscription sales of these so-called exempt magazines are exempt?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anne_owings_wilson" startTime="243.705" stopTime="244.740">
            <label>Ms. Anne Owings Wilson</label>
            <text syncTime="243.705" offset="1116581">That is correct, Your Honor.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="244.740" offset="1120656">It doesn't turn an whether the sale is by way of subscription or not?</text>

          <turn speaker="anne_owings_wilson" startTime="250.311" stopTime="296.507">
            <label>Ms. Anne Owings Wilson</label>
            <text syncTime="250.311" offset="1143017">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.411" offset="1147406">He found that the words "when sold through regular subscriptions" were words of description rather than limitation, and that since Arkansas Times was a publication that was regularly sold through subscriptions that all sales of Arkansas Times Magazine were exempt from taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.341" offset="1235073">It is our contention that, because newspapers are exempt from taxation and because these other very specific types of publications are exempt from publication, that sales of Arkansas Times should also be exempt from publications or that the other publications should be taxed, that there should not be discrimination.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="296.507" stopTime="320.372">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="296.507" offset="1327755">Well, Ms. Wilson, I guess we don't even have to look at the newspaper question if we focus on just the particular types of magazines that are exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.367" offset="1383239">Presumably we could answer this case by answering that question alone, quite apart from the newspaper exemption question.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anne_owings_wilson" startTime="320.372" stopTime="359.449">
            <label>Ms. Anne Owings Wilson</label>
            <text syncTime="320.372" offset="1423259">That is correct if the remedy were necessarily to be to extend the exemption to sales of Arkansas Times Magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.846" offset="1469130">But if the case went back to Arkansas courts and the court found that, rather than extending that exemption, that it would simply delete it and tax all sales of magazines regardless of content, there would still be discrimination between magazines and newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.825" offset="1541019">And it is our contention that any distinctions that exist between newspapers and magazines are constitutionally invalid and--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="359.449" stopTime="381.279">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="359.449" offset="1579576">Ms. Wilson, excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.415" offset="1583442">That same thing could happen even if we rested our decision on discrimination between magazines and newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.869" offset="1613221">The same thing could happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.905" offset="1617401">So it seems to me we don't prevent against that deprivation of relief by resting our decision on the newspaper discrimination, rather than on the magazine discrimination, do we?</text>

            <text syncTime="383.731" offset="1676647">Well, I'm not sure I understood your answer to Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.350" offset="1687096">Justice O'Connor asked why couldn't... why do we have to reach the newspaper issue so long as you're discriminating between this magazine and other magazines, isn't that enough?</text>
            <text syncTime="397.455" offset="1731608">And you said yes, it would be, so long as when it goes back what happens is that the exemption is extended to your magazine, rather than the exemption for other magazines being eliminated, right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anne_owings_wilson" startTime="412.584" stopTime="414.350">
            <label>Ms. Anne Owings Wilson</label>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="414.350" offset="1799109">But that same thing could happen even if we rested our decision on the discrimination between your magazine and newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.773" offset="1828888">Likewise, when it goes back, likewise when it goes back, unless we say something about it, the court could say, instead of extending the newspaper exemption to your magazine, we'll eliminate the newspaper exemption.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anne_owings_wilson" startTime="436.532" stopTime="437.399">
            <label>Ms. Anne Owings Wilson</label>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="437.399" offset="1891373">Okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.815" offset="1893045">So that issue has nothing to do with whether we base this decision on the magazine exemption or on the newspaper exemption.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anne_owings_wilson" startTime="445.971" stopTime="476.240">
            <label>Ms. Anne Owings Wilson</label>
            <text syncTime="445.971" offset="1925646">Well, again, if this Court were to find that the discrimination between newspapers and magazines was unconstitutional and the Arkansas court then found that the remedy was to delete the exemption, the result would be that all publications would be treated the same, whether they be newspapers or magazines or sports journals or whatever, and that would end the discrimination and we'd have a constitutional result at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="559.042" offset="2377878">You know, maybe communist propaganda or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.596" offset="2396163">Here one would have to assume that the legislature had it in for your kind of magazine and wanted to somehow discourage its circulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="585.543" offset="2483935">On the contrary, just the timing of it shows that it's not, because the Arkansas Times didn't even begin publication until some years after these exemptions were in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.769" offset="2532836">Nevertheless, it is discriminated against, regardless of the purpose of the legislature and regardless of whether it was trying, deliberately trying, to suppress this kind of speech.</text>

            <text syncTime="618.766" offset="2616846">But when you go on and say it's a content-based discrimination, usually the reason we talk about a content-based discrimination is you infer from that that there was a desire of the legislature to suppress the content that it's discriminating against.</text>

            <text syncTime="1898.747" offset="7736741">All the state of Arkansas, I submit to this Court, needs to demonstrate is that there is some rational basis for these four generic classifications found in the exemptions granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.352" offset="7771118">A frustration which I feel and I know this Court must also face is the frustration that the record is devoid of any legislative explanation for the granting of these exemptions in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.475" offset="7815631">I would speculate that in granting these exemptions for any publications... and exemptions were granted, as I said, for newspapers, for general interest publications much like the Arkansas Times, as well as for these four generic types of publications... that the purpose behind these exemptions was to foster communication in what is basically a rural state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.187" offset="7886475">And within our general scheme of taxation, that sales tax is applied, as I said, to the sale of all tangible personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.609" offset="7916150">A comprehensive section of exemptions, however, was adopted that dealt with First Amendment outlets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.929" offset="7941437">As I mentioned to the Court, for newspapers Arkansas, like 37 other states, created an exemption from sales tax on the sale of that paper, the reason being, I submit, because of the unique means of distribution, young boys and young girls, independent contractors, and the difficulty in administering and collecting that tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.308" offset="8011027">The Arkansas legislature created for publications like newspapers and like the Arkansas Times an exemption from sales tax on advertising space sold, which comprises, as I have said to this Court, 60 to 90 percent of the base revenues for such publications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.651" offset="8068392">The Arkansas Times, having a circulation of 25,000 to 30,000 in terms of subscription and sales at $1.75 per volume, simply can't support itself on subscriptions and over the counter sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.292" offset="8114890">That exemption from that sales tax on advertising space sold, which comprises the bulk of their operating bases, gives those type publications the opportunity to publish for profit and foster the communication and the information and ideas that they would carry.</text>
