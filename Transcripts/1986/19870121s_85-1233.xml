            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="9.841" offset="131077">This case is here from the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.610" offset="150199">Petitioner operates a paper mill on the New York Shore of Lake Champlain.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.858" offset="175172">Respondents are property owners whose land is located across the lake on the Vermont Shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.243" offset="204742">Respondents brought suit in the Vermont District Court, claiming that the mill was discharging pollutants into the lake, and that this caused a continuing nuisance under Vermont law.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.915" offset="259391">Under present procedures authorized by the Clean Water Act, petitioner has obtained a premit to make these discharges in accordance with both the New York and federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.924" offset="315397">Two questions are presented: First, whether the Vermont Court has jurisdiction, and second whether in light of the provisions of the Clean Water Act, the nuisance law of Vermont maybe applied when the source of pollution is in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.895" offset="391361">Petitioner moved for summary judgment claiming that under the Clean Water Act the suit could only be maintained in New York, the state in which the mill is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.242" offset="432739">The District Court denied petitioners motion and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.130" offset="452279">For the reason stated in an opinion filed today, we agree that the property owners could maintain this action in the Vermont Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.796" offset="494911">We also find however that the Courts below erred in holding that the case could be decided under the nuisance law of Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.773" offset="538796">Under the Clean Water Act, New York, as a source stated, has authority to issue a permit consistent with both federal and State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.351" offset="589160">The Clean Water Act is a comprehensive regulatory statute applicable to navigable waters in every state.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.836" offset="623120">We think the Act preempts all inconsistent state laws that would interfere with the enforcement of the Federal Act, if every affected state could apply its own law.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.878" offset="679231">We therefore conclude that to the extent a Vermont law may differ from that of New York, it is preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.539" offset="713921">Accordingly we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.561" offset="733983">We remand the case for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.373" offset="753209">Justice Brennan has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Justices Marshall and Blackmun have joined; Justice Stevens also has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Justice Blackmun also has joined.</text>
