            <text syncTime="101.532" offset="555714">The constitutional test for obscenity which is applicable to the states through the First and the Fourteenth Amendments contains three parts, each part of which must exist separately and independently in order for a work to be found obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.077" offset="629902">The third part of that three-part test, the third component, is a value consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.099" offset="658010">And that value consideration has been specifically crafted to protect works having value from hostile majoritarian sentiment.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.622" offset="704090">Richard Pope and Charles Morrison were both tried under a State of Illinois statute which allowed the views of a majority to determine the question of whether the work was utterly without redeeming social value.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.666" offset="764276">In short, community standards were applied to the value consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.570" offset="787891">That Illinois obscenity statute is unconstitutional in each and every possible application, no matter to whom applied or to what applied, whether it's a retailer, a distributor, a publisher, or, as in this case, a clerk in an adult bookstore, or whether it's applied to a--</text>

            <text syncTime="190.439" offset="911398">Subsequent to the convictions in this case, the State of Illinois passed a new obscenity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.029" offset="945775">I think it's instructive to note that the obscenity statute put into place by the State of Illinois legislature conforms precisely to the construction for which we argue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.270" offset="994676">And explicitly, it puts community standards into the first element of the test, which is the patently offensive part of the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.776" offset="1032710">It includes community standards in the second element, which is the... excuse me, the first is prurient interest; the second is patently offensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.631" offset="1068132">And it omits community standards from the value determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.785" offset="1084746">So what we have is the State of Illinois arguing for a construction of the statute which is really consistent... inconsistent with what it has on the books right now.</text>

            <text syncTime="1718.631" offset="7024155">These six magazines were purchased from two adult bookstores in Rockford, Illinois, that advertised magazines and marital aids for sale, and video films to watch inside the stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.356" offset="7071071">Access to those stores was limited to adults only, and there hundreds of magazines just like these for sale inside those stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.362" offset="7103045">Everyone of the magazines was sexually explicit, and the proprietors had even grouped the magazines in categories, categories that advertised the prurient appeal of the particular subject matter involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.352" offset="7154976">The titles alone of these magazines revealed that their extensive... their exclusive purpose is to appeal to prurient interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.608" offset="7187995">Each one of the magazines which you have before you today contains an uninterrupted series of photographs depicting the same kind of offensive hard-core sexual conduct described by this Court in Miller and defined by Illinois law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.218" offset="7250480">Not one of those magazines contains any stories or any attempts at literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.056" offset="7273886">There are only extended captions, captions that reiterate in graphic terms the explicit nature of the photographs themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="1860.391" offset="7591221">Today this Court is asked to decide whether value determinations should be made with reference to ordinary adults within the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.913" offset="7621314">We wish to make two arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.115" offset="7630091">First, that such an instruction does indeed serve the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.167" offset="7646287">And secondly, even if value determinations may not be made in this manner, the petitioners' convictions must nevertheless be affirmed because they were not materially prejudiced by the instructions at their trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.208" offset="7698428">After Memoirs and Miller, jurors are required in the first instance to sit as fact-finders to determine if the material appeals to prurient interest, depicts sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, or whether the material has value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.051" offset="7757778">This Court has indicated that those three elements coalesce in a community definition of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.323" offset="7786931">So in submitting the case to the jury for its initial determination, then, there's no reason to treat value determinations in any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.679" offset="7824338">Jurors need a consistent frame of reference when making these three determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.333" offset="7846908">In these particular cases, the Pope and Morrison juries were instructed to discard their personal opinions, to consider the views of ordinary adults within the whole State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.724" offset="7892465">We submit to you that that instruction was constitutionally proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.526" offset="7911691">Jury determinations of value should be made with reference to community standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.596" offset="7931963">And I use the term "community" in the sense that, by definition, it will look beyond the idiosyncratic opinion of a single person to focus on common views held by a larger group of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.071" offset="7981909">Juries were designed to bring a sense of community to the law, and jurors perform their intended function when they make judgments of this very sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.410" offset="8015241">Contrary to petitioners' claim, community standards are, in a sense, objective, because they prevent jurors from indulging their personal opinions or tastes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.135" offset="8054111">That does not mean that the First Amendment requires any particular geographic designation of the community, because I submit to you that decisions of those nature are best left to the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="2502.059" offset="10157804">Because they repeatedly fear in their brief the possibility of parochial determinations, they also, at least to my mind, seem to favor a national community standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.582" offset="10199914">We find three flaws with that approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.634" offset="10212139">First, parochial determinations are not per se unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.204" offset="10230425">The First Amendment does not require a national standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.223" offset="10246516">Secondly, we doubt that that sort of standard could ever be defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.426" offset="10263339">I do not know how anyone in Illinois can divine the... at least of artistic value or literary merit for Las Vegas and New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.499" offset="10303567">And finally, I think it's been suggested earlier by the Court, that a national standard could actually work to petitioners' disadvantage, in the event that distribution of some magazines was ultimately discouraged in some portions of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.992" offset="10361559">The third and final standard that's suggested by petitioners, and amici especially, would place value determinations in the hands of experts, upon the dubious assumption that jurors cannot be trusted to determine value within a work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.519" offset="10423731">We suggest... we reject, rather, any suggestion that obscenity determinations be made by blue ribbon panels of experts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.309" offset="10462810">Jurors have been deciding questions of obscenity xxx all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.094" offset="10482036">The courts have always assumed that laymen can recognize value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.582" offset="10499904">Jurors, we believe, can be trusted to recognize bona fide expressions of ideas, even if they don't personally approve of those ideas, or even if those works don't suit their particular taste.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.390" offset="10551208">Ultimately, any of petitioners' standards will mandate the use of expert testimony in obscenity prosecutions, because all of petitioners' standards presuppose some body of knowledge beyond the ken of the average juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.565" offset="10607842">We reject both that assumption and the conclusion requiring expert testimony in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.569" offset="10635845">In contrast, we believe that jurors sitting as ordinary adults are entitled to determine which magazines have value to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.075" offset="10669909">A community standard, with an appropriate scope of appellate review, will best serve that goal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2997.959" offset="12141438">We also dispute the argument that the Illinois statute is facially invalid or overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.947" offset="12165367">The number of impermissible approaches always involves a prediction, at best.</text>

            <text syncTime="3024.943" offset="12249376">Absent a real indication of substantial overbreadth, then, the Illinois statute should be permitted to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.613" offset="12284067">I think, perhaps, that petitioners have misstated something in the opening portion of their argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.869" offset="12309040">I would submit to you that the Illinois statute... neither the Illinois statute nor the Illinois courts, through any authoritative construction, have ever required the application of any community standard to value determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.962" offset="12369435">As a matter of fact, the Illinois appellate court in these cases merely refused to reverse on the facts of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.032" offset="12393781">They did not mandate the use of community standards for value determinations in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.770" offset="12416665">There is no reason then to believe that this result would ever be repeated, and as a result, invalidation of the statute would be wholly inappropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3095.270" offset="12530663">In addition to the broad powers of the appellate courts, there's a number of other important safeguards here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.693" offset="12556367">A defendant is always free to seek jurors with diverse experiences and particular backgrounds during his voir dire examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.763" offset="12588655">Expert testimony will always be permissible under our approach to establish the value of a particular work or to define the relevant community attitudes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.821" offset="12632854">The return a guilty verdict, the jury must deliberate within the confines of the Miller decision, and the jury must also find prurient appeal and patently offense sexual conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.962" offset="12677471">The prosecution bears a burden of proof with respect to all three of the Miller tests, and so there is a presumption of nonobscenity in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.151" offset="12710176">Defendants will receive all of the safeguards of any prosecution, including the presumption of innocence and the reasonable doubt standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="3362.795" offset="13600847">As this Court has observed in Miller, to equate a robust exchange of ideas with the commercial exploitation of obscenity is merely to demean the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3385.142" offset="13690186">The issue was presented to the Illinois appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.279" offset="13702725">The Illinois appellate court resolved the issue by saying, it should also be noted that thus far the United States Supreme Court has never held that an objective standard as opposed to a community one should be applied in the judging of materials on utterly without redeeming social value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.306" offset="13766882">When you combine that with some language in the statute about interpretation of evidence, it says, obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults, you have a construction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.578" offset="13807946">And I don't think the state ever argued in their briefs that there was no construction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.466" offset="13827486">To answer Justice Stevens questions, no, Justice Stevens, you do not have to view the materials in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.869" offset="13853086">The issue in this case isn't whether the materials are obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.337" offset="13866983">The issue is the facial constitutionality of the Illinois obscenity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.924" offset="13901360">That statute, as applied to my clients, and as applied to anyone else in the world, or in the State of Illinois, is unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="3542.610" offset="14320051">And Pope was tried after Morrison in front of the same trial judge, and after denial of the same motion asserting that community standards should not be included in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.799" offset="14364772">So we already had a construction from the state court judge as to what he was going to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.020" offset="14381700">We tendered the most favorable instruction we could get, consistent with that construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.424" offset="14407300">I'd like to answer one of your concerns, Justice O'Connor, when you asked, well, what standard would this Court apply in reviewing materials?</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.196" offset="14442408">I think you recognize the problem, and that is, that if you apply community standards to the value component, how does this Court review the materials if you're not familiar with the community standards in the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.770" offset="14492668">And one has to remember that in many cases the state is not required to put on evidence... in all cases, the state is not required to put on evidence of contemporary community standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.728" offset="14536554">So there really could be no meaningful judicial review of that particular finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.815" offset="14564870">In response to a question of yours, Justice Stevens, I think I heard counsel say that evidence of value in New York could not be admitted in Illinois if the state's construction was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.308" offset="14618891">And that's the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.426" offset="14627355">That illustrates the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.510" offset="14635610">In Jenkins, which was a Georgia case, there was all kinds of evidence about national acclaim, critical reviews; that type of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.866" offset="14669047">The court even took judicial notice of information not originally in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.703" offset="14688377">Now Jenkins, of course, didn't decide the case on value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.972" offset="14701543">But I don't think this Court would or has suggested that evidence outside a particular community should not be relevant to the constitutional determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.850" offset="14769043">Unless the Court has any further questions, I will not speak any further.</text>
