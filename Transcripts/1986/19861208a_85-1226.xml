            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="138435">We will hear argument first this morning in No. 85-1226, Commissioner of Internal Revenue versus Robert P. Groetzinger.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.272" offset="175424">Mr. Lauber, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <text syncTime="12.058" offset="186605">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, the question here is whether a person who spends his full time gambling at racetracks for his own account is engaged in a trade or business for federal income tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.554" offset="272600">This is a question on which the Commissioner, the courts, and gamblers have gone back and forth over the years, depending largely, it seems, on whether it was good or bad taxwise for a gambler to be in a trade or business at the particular tax year involved under the relevant tax provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.599" offset="352744">The provision that gave rise to this case was a minimum tax provision that was in effect from 1976 until 1982 under which gambling losses generally were items of tax preference that could give rise to a minimum tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.179" offset="431111">The way a gambler could avoid minimum tax would be to argue that his trade or business was gambling, so that his gambling losses were not garden variety itemized deductions, but rather were trade or business deductions that were exempt from minimum tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.224" offset="503313">The Court of Appeals below accepted this argument, persuaded in large part by the seeming inequity of imposing a minimum tax on somebody who had net gambling losses for the taxable year, as Mr. Groetzinger did.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.352" offset="571754">Congress has eliminated that inequity for years after 1982 because it amended the minimum tax law in that year to remove gambling losses from the minimum tax base.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.695" offset="633194">Now that Congress has fixed that, the IRS cannot really tell whether it is better for us to win or lose this case from a revenue point of view prospectively because, as I said, it can be good or bad for a gambler to be in or not to be in business.</text>

            <text syncTime="142.524" offset="708531">It is impossible to tell, Justice Brennan, because there are so many different numbers on the tax return that can go up or down depending on whether you are in business.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.512" offset="744476">It affects the adjusted gross income which is a floor beneath your casualty loss deduction and your medical deduction, the ceiling on your charitable contribution deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.070" offset="786690">It can enable you to take home office expenses deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.272" offset="799437">It can also make you liable for self-employment tax if you are in a trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.176" offset="819082">It is like the FICA tax employees pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.711" offset="829217">So, depending on whether the gambler has gains or losses for the year and whether he has medical expenses and so forth it can be good or bad and you simply can't program a computer to figure out what the net will be, so the reason we sought certiorari here was to get a clear answer to the question to resolve the conflict in the circuits and get an answer we hope will be consistent with the overall structure of the--</text>

            <text syncTime="219.073" offset="1014686">I would think the one possible effect the decision could have... I haven't read the new tax law from cover to cover but the new tax law does put a 2 percent floor underneath investment type expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.201" offset="1083232">You can't deduct expenses of investing, of getting advice from brokers, investment, valueline, that kind of stuff except to the extent it exceeds 2 percent of your adjusted gross income, and that basically puts a floor under the Section 212 deduction now in the Code, and there may be some greater incentive for investors to try and say they are in a trade or business under the new tax law to avoid that 2 percent floor.</text>

            <text syncTime="410.459" offset="1780179">When it first came to the Tax Court in 1976, Judge Tannenwald defined the term much more narrowly and adopted what we call the goods and services test of Justice Frankfurter's concurring opinion in Deputy v. DuPont to hold that a gambler was not in a trade or business, and the gambler there did not want to be in a trade or business because he was trying to be hit with self-employment tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1449.005" offset="5934379">The courts might also have to draw arbitrary lines between different types of gambling activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.009" offset="5958412">The respondent probably himself would agree that a retired person who lives in Las Vegas and plays slot machines eight hours a day is not in a trade or business.</text>

            <text syncTime="1853.846" offset="7553762">Anybody that says placing bets at the racetrack is an investment has another think coming because he doesn't have a chance unless he knows what he is doing, unless he studies, unless he works 60 to 80 hours a week as Bob Groetzinger does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.344" offset="7639757">Otherwise he has no chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.462" offset="7652192">It is not an investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.748" offset="7657416">Now, the difference between an investor and the active trader according to the courts is that the investor is letting his money earn a living for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.577" offset="7740695">He isn't doing the earning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.946" offset="7750203">His investment is doing the earning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.731" offset="7765354">He buys stocks and bonds and he puts them in his vault and every so often he gets a check for a dividend or for interest, so he is not working.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.306" offset="7819584">The active trader is working practically every day of his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.977" offset="7846334">Now, a trader who goes to the brokerage office maybe once a week or two or three times a month and buys and sells a few stocks or commodities certainly is not in business because it isn't a frequent activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.677" offset="7945077">That is one of the things that all of the courts have said, that the activity must be frequent and regular.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.033" offset="7982484">The government says that the active trader is engaged in holding himself out to others as selling goods or services, and they justify it by saying that he is buying and selling stocks and commodities.</text>
