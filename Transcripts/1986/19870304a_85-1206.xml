            <text syncTime="78.166" offset="450651">The issue in this case is whether the scheme which the states have devised to circumvent federal law frustrates a federal purpose and violates the expressed intent of Congress when it enacted the Veterans' Benefits Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="599.752" offset="2536999">Mr. Rose consulted with me and wanted to know if he had rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.453" offset="2555807">After advising him that in my opinion he may have rights under the Veterans' Benefits Act, I advised him that if he did not pay the child support as ordered he would probably go to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.332" offset="2627278">Mr. Rose decided to enforce his federal rights and stopped making child support payments except that he paid the sum of $90, which is the minimum amount that is designated by the Veterans Administration for the benefit of the children who are not living with the veteran.</text>

            <text syncTime="1772.430" offset="7227651">Mr. Chief Justice, and if it may please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.917" offset="7249594">This case is not a veterans case to start with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.821" offset="7273208">It is a case that arose out of a divorce in Tennessee where there was a hearing, where Mr. Rose was represented by an attorney who declined to put on proof in a divorce case, that the court, the Tennessee Court was the only forum that Ms. Rose had to approach because the State of Tennessee as the exclusive jurisdiction of dissolution of marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.437" offset="7367667">Custody and support flow from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.389" offset="7379474">At the time that the court originally heard the divorce, Mr. Rose made $43,000 tax-free.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.809" offset="7409254">The court is obligated under Tennessee law to make a decision as to the relative abilities to pay by the parents of the children and then look at the needs of the children, and then make an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.034" offset="7458051">They did this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.784" offset="7461081">They made an award of $800 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.650" offset="7468604">Of the $800 a month there was a source of income for Mr. Rose outside his veterans benefits in the amount of $474 today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.675" offset="7512699">It was $465 at the time the award was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.794" offset="7525133">The difference would have to be made up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.162" offset="7534642">In the original divorce they split the equity in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.048" offset="7550106">Mr. Rose got $12,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.065" offset="7558256">I would respectfully suggest that the federal statutes do not protect the property... the payments, once items have been purchased, and that that money was available to make up the difference between his income that was not veterans benefits and the $800 awarded by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.444" offset="7631713">The time for the contempt was approximately five or six months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.515" offset="7648013">At that point in time there was no way... I said there is no way... there is no indication that the $12,000 had been spent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.169" offset="7674658">In fact, Mr. Rose files an affidavit that says,</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.371" offset="7687406">"I have spent some of the money and the rest of it I have set aside for this litigation as opposed to paying my kids' child support. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2590.968" offset="10501838">It is the position of the State of Tennessee that Congress has not pre-empted in this case the traditional function of the states in determining child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.109" offset="10546351">The Tennessee statute is constitutional on its face and is applied here in that there is no expressed conflict with federal law and no major damage to clear and substantial federal interest in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2625.256" offset="10639034">Justice, it is our view that 3107, which is the apportionment statute, is an administrative aid in child support enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.164" offset="10686576">It is an alternative and a parallel proceeding which is compatible with state court enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.269" offset="10719073">It is a method that allows the government to make direct payments to the children, something that of course the state court cannot do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.458" offset="10755749">It is available in addition to or when state court remedies are unavailable or inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.862" offset="10789394">When this statute was originally passed in 1924 it primarily was concerned with incompetence, and it still applies in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.920" offset="10833698">There might be a case where there was a separation but not a divorce, where the husband is in another state or where they might not even know where the husband is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.108" offset="10870374">It is a way that the government can assist in a direct payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.076" offset="10890227">We think the statute is clear that it is not exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.964" offset="10905796">The language... the word "may" is used twice in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.249" offset="10927007">The state court in its order is not making an apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.486" offset="10951876">It's not doing anything akin to 3107.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.307" offset="10967236">It's not executing on a federal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.009" offset="10977998">And there's no division of that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.378" offset="10991478">The state believes that this Court, as well as Congress, has recognized that domestic relations including the protection of children and the support of children belongs to the laws of the state, and the state courts provide forums and have historical expertise and the ability to give a comprehensive review to support, custody and visitation, all of those things that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.099" offset="11118328">So, there has developed an area, I believe, in the law which requires a presumption against pre... emption in the field of domestic relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.490" offset="11167961">Congress must positively require by direct enactment, before this pre-emption will be presumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.678" offset="11204637">The consequences of the conflict, if they could be found in one of these three statutes which we submit are not there, those conflicts would have to sufficiently injure a federal program so as to require a non-recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.807" offset="11277153">We believe that here there is no major damage to any clear and substantial federal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.330" offset="11307246">The purpose here, as indicated earlier, is that if a veteran is disabled that he and his dependents will have a source of income to replace these lost earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.255" offset="11367014">I think, as Justice O'Connor indicated, there is a body of law from this Court beginning with the Westmore decision in 1904, that says that children are not creditors and child support is not a debt; that this exemption in 3101 is for the veteran and his family and not for the veteran against his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.990" offset="11477878">Prior judicial considerations in this area, we think overwhelmingly show that the courts... the D.C. Circuit, two decisions there, and nine states have held that child support is not within exemptions, and Congress has re-enacted this statute many times without significant change.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.640" offset="11584562">We believe that there was a desire on the part of Congress to protect veterans from creditors and not to protect veterans from state courts; that if Congress had intended the 3107, the apportionment aspect, to be a sole recourse rather than an ancillary and an assisting resource, then it could have said so clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.028" offset="11710054">We submit that under the facts of this case, that there has been no damage to any substantial federal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.051" offset="11754149">It is suggested by the Solicitor that the interest here is that if a veteran believes that his disability benefits might be awarded to his children by a state court that somehow he might conceal his injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.881" offset="11829486">That does not seem to be a strong purpose because military pay is already subject to garnishment itself, and we believe it untenable that Congress would have intended that this result would happen.</text>

            <text syncTime="2947.413" offset="11927602">You suggest that many of them may be voluntary arrangements where there is not necessarily a divorce situation but where there is a reason why they would not want to pay the money directly to the veteran but might to a dependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.471" offset="11971801">I just notice the statute authorizes payment to, on behalf of the veteran, spouse, children or dependent parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.625" offset="12000431">But this case doesn't involve a spouse.</text>

            <text syncTime="2992.525" offset="12108056">When the Solicitor mentioned in that regard that it could be 20 percent as a minimum given, under the regulations that apparently only applies to a hardship situation and not a regular apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.403" offset="12171585">It is difficult for me to answer your question but I think that we would have to say that if the apportionment statute means anything at all, that it would have to be available to a separated or a former spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.798" offset="12241176">But we believe it is an ancillary procedure that, in line with the 1975, 1977 and '84 child enforcement support legislation, that Congress recognized that we've got an emergency in this country in supporting children, in getting assets available to them, and this is just a way that the federal government assists in what is primarily a state, traditional state function.</text>
