            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>This denaturalization case raises the issue as to how to determine the materiality, or lack of materiality of a misrepresentation in a visa application and a petition for naturalization when the truth would not have resulted in the ineligibility of the naturalized citizen for either a visa or for citizenship.</text>
            <text>Here the Third Circuit transformed the immaterial misrepresentations of date and town of birth by applying evidentiary standard less than and inconsistent with that required by the long-standing requirement of Schneiderman of an evidentiary standard of proof that is doubt free.</text>
            <text>And it applied that diluted standard to reach a non-existent ultimate disqualifying fact.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>You say a standard that is doubt free, Mr. Williamson?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_j_williamson">
            <label>Mr. Donald J. Williamson</label>
            <text>Doubt free.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Is that beyond a reasonable doubt?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_j_williamson">
            <label>Mr. Donald J. Williamson</label>
            <text>It is at least, according to this Court in [inaudible] the equivalent of the criminal beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>I don't think of beyond a reasonable doubt as being doubt free.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_j_williamson">
            <label>Mr. Donald J. Williamson</label>
            <text>The language of clear, convincing and unequivocal which does not leave any issue in doubt, I would characterize as doubt free.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, clear and convincing has been thought of a standard between a preponderance and beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_j_williamson">
            <label>Mr. Donald J. Williamson</label>
            <text>But, this Court went further in Schneiderman to indicate that it not only has to be clear, convincing and unequivocal, but it will leave no issue in doubt and any inference of fact or law as far as reasonably as possible it should be drawn in favor of the citizen.</text>
            <text>But, I would argue in terms of the application to this case that doubt free is more of a short end expression in my having to completely repeat each time that language of the Court.</text>
            <text>But nevertheless, if we're to take literally the Chaunt second prong of the second expression of the second prong then this Court is likewise free to take literally the language in Schneiderman which is doubt free and which in the concurring opinions is fairly clear that this Court was trying to avoid any potentiality of having two classes of citizenship and therefore did in fact make the standard of proof as vigorous as possible.</text>
            <text>When the applications of the fact to this particular case the District Court was able to apply all of the formulations of Chaunt and Fedorenko, taken in combination, and under none of those standards did it find the misrepresentations to be material.</text>
            <text>What happened here however is that the Third Circuit tried to get from point A, the suppressed truth by drawing an inference as to a residency permit in which correspondence indicated that it was issued without special restrictions and from that it drew a tendentious inference that that would have led to a conclusion that the naturalized citizen was not a victim of Nazi persecution.</text>
            <text>I think we demonstrate fairly clearly that the law and the regulations at that time had no such requirement that one had to be a victim of Nazi persecution.</text>
            <text>So that the ultimate disqualifying fact to which the Third Circuit, I reach this conclusion is in essence a false premise and its logic was bound to face since it didn't exist.</text>
            <text>But in addition to which the case illustrates that you cannot have a standard which you can characterize as it did as probability and still in effect comply with safeguarding the rights of the denaturalized citizens.</text>
            <text>Because what they did there is they turned Schneiderman upside down and instead of drawing the inferences in favor of the citizen they draw the most tenuous inference in favor of a government.</text>
            <text>In point of fact, the inference is neutral because every person whether or not a citizen of Germany at the Third Reich at that time, or even today, who is in Germany whether it be a citizen, or displaced person, or foreigner, has to register and the registration is a simple bureaucratic act.</text>
            <text>All it does is establish that the neutral fact that one resided in Tubingen.</text>
            <text>Now the irony is that the establishment of the residence in Poltringen rather, at that time, established that the petitioner was a displaced person who was covered by the Presidential Directive of December 22nd, 1945.</text>
            <text>Now that was incorporated specifically on December of 1946, in the Federal Regulations incorporated the Truman Directive as part of the priority for Non-preference Immigration Quota Visas.</text>
            <text>The Third Circuit looked at the President Truman Directive in isolation and did not take into consideration that indeed it was incorporated in the regulations.</text>
            <text>As a result of which they came to the improper conclusion that was a mere generalized statement instead of in fact a Presidential Order directing that all displaced persons would, in effect, receive a priority under a Non-preference Quota Immigration Visa standard.</text>
            <text>This Court has never applied the second prong of Chaunt even in Chaunt.</text>
            <text>And as a result of which it is dicta and I would submit that if it is to be taken literally, it is impossible to reconcile the dicta in the second prong of Chaunt with the Schneiderman test.</text>
            <text>What has happened is we have two formulations in Chaunt within two pages.</text>
            <text>One on Page 353 and one Page 355.</text>
            <text>The latter one picks up the word, "possibly", and the question has in effect, plagued the Courts of Appeals as to how one applies the test and where, in effect, what part of the phraseology it modifies.</text>
            <text>Whereas it is reasonably clear that in Chaunt this Court in effect did say that you had to connect the suppressed fact, there the arrests, to an ultimate disqualifying fact, their communist affiliation, and what the Court said is that the attempted connection by the government at that time was too tenuous and in addition to which it said as part of its holding that no investigation would have been conducted because there, there was a disclosure which, in effect, that disclosure did precipitate an investigation.</text>
            <text>Similarly here, although the petitioner did in fact misstate his date and town of birth, he disclosed his residence in Poltringen and in Tubingen in Germany prior to the end of the war.</text>
            <text>That was disclosed and it did not trigger off an investigation by the Vice Counsel to look at the records in Tubingen.</text>
            <text>But we don't know that it did not because the Vice Counsel in effect, indicates in the application for visa, police dossier available.</text>
            <text>A police dossier meant that they went to the available public records of the jurisdiction in which the individual resided.</text>
            <text>So that presumably we would have gone to Poltringen or Tubingen and what would they have found?</text>
            <text>Contrary to the indications of faulty review by the Third Circuit, they would have found the original document which we have in our Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text>That is the original register of Ammerbuch, which in effect is the district which controlled the residential permits there.</text>
            <text>And there it contains the same information which is reflected in the internal passport.</text>
            <text>It contains the statement that he was born in Kaunas and born in Canniest on the incorrect date.</text>
            <text>So that in point of fact there is no connection, proper connection on the factual basis to go from point A, the truth of the true date and place of birth which the District Court properly held would not have led anywhere because that would not have created any type of suspicion.</text>
            <text>In addition to which it could not connect to something which is the residence rather the appropriate fact was to disclose fact which connected to the residence and which is his residence in Poltringen which is on the application.</text>
            <text>But in any event, the whole exercise is an exercise in futility if at the end the ultimate disqualifying fact doesn't exist.</text>
            <text>There was no requirement that one had to be a victim of Nazi persecution in order to get a visa.</text>
            <text>And equally important there is no exclusion which excludes someone who's not a victim of Nazi persecution from obtaining a visa.</text>
            <text>This naturalized citizen received his visa under the 1924 Act and the Third Circuit at least says that you should determine the validity of either the visa or the citizenship petition judged by the law in effect at the time that he obtained it.</text>
            <text>Under the 1924 Act, since he received his visa in 1948 having applied for it in February of 1947, the law at that time was that the visa shall specify the nationality, which quota the immigrant is coming into and such additional information necessary for the proper enforcement of the immigration laws.</text>
            <text>And what they provided for is one form, but that one form was an attempt to cover many different applications.</text>
            <text>As a result of which some of the questions that are asked in the form have no relevance or in the standards here no materiality to the ultimate decision to be arrived at.</text>
            <text>By way of illustration the form requires that you set forth your age.</text>
            <text>Of course the age is relevant if you are attempting to obtain a first preference because, excuse me, a second preference, obtain a second preference because the second preference is available to unmarried children under the age of 21 years old.</text>
            <text>Obviously if the petitioner attempted to make himself, an alien, an unmarried alien under the age of 21 years then clearly that would have been material.</text>
            <text>But the difference of the two years from 30 to 32 years was meaningless piece of information.</text>
            <text>It was not necessary for the proper enforcement of the immigration laws at that time.</text>
            <text>Similarly, he did not attempt, for example, it asked whether or not he's married and indeed he disclosed the fact of his marriage, but that marriage had no relevance to the Non-preference Immigration Quota Visa which he obtained.</text>
            <text>Although it would have had relevance to a first preference, so that in point of fact information is requested in that form which is not necessary to enforcement of the laws.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>--I would agree with the Chief Justice on that.</text>
            <text>I would like to have you comment.</text>

          <turn speaker="donald_j_williamson">
            <label>Mr. Donald J. Williamson</label>
            <text>--Yes.</text>
            <text>The District Court found that no investigation would have been conducted had the truth of the suppressed facts been disclosed.</text>
            <text>And he obviously was not clearly erroneous because no suspicion would have been aroused by a man who made himself two years older, by a man who placed himself in a city rather than a town in Lithuania.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, now did the Third Circuit find that clearly erroneous?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_j_williamson">
            <label>Mr. Donald J. Williamson</label>
            <text>Well the Third Circuit used the language of apply a clearly erroneous test, but that's not what they did.</text>
            <text>What they did in effect is to say that an investigation would have been conducted and the way in which they did it is they looked to the discrepancies of the documents which are ultimately discovered and they reasoned backward from the discrepancy of the document back from the truth.</text>
            <text>But, it's not the consequence of the lie that's significant, it's the consequence of the truth.</text>
            <text>Would the truth have led to an investigation.</text>
            <text>And that's what this Court, as I read it, in Fedorenko said.</text>
            <text>Would the truth, if disclosed, have led to an investigation?</text>
            <text>Now the reason why I argue, in effect, that the Court of Appeals made a de novo finding is that although when you apply a mixed question of law and fact, it may be that the legal standard is something which they could address themselves to.</text>
            <text>But they cannot change the factual component unless it is clearly erroneous and here they changed the factual component of whether an investigation would have been conducted.</text>
            <text>But if I may also follow up on the dissent, if you would, of Mr. Justice White in Fedorenko.</text>
            <text>The District Court found that since no investigation would have been conducted it would have satisfied that test.</text>
            <text>But I would also submit that the test would likewise be satisfied because under these particular circumstances the naturalized citizen did rebut Mr. Justice White's suggestion that if you have a probability test and it establishes a presumption, that presumption is a rebuttable presumption.</text>
            <text>But nevertheless you still have to reach an ultimate disqualifying fact.</text>
            <text>Here the petitioner did rebut the presumption as to whether or not one had to be a victim of Nazi persecution and he did it very simply.</text>
            <text>He did in the first instance by his cross examination.</text>
            <text>The Third Circuit reached the false premise by examining only the direct examination of Former Vice Counsel Finger.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>I was curious about that too.</text>
            <text>It seemed to me that the Court of Appeals treated his testimony as if it had to be believed.</text>
            <text>And I thought the District Court could totally disbelieve the testimony of any witness whether interested, or not.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald J. Williamson</label>
            <text>Not only could he, but he did.</text>
            <text>Now in a very genteel way he said that the law and the regulations in effect suggest that Mr. Finger was in error, but perhaps there was an informal policy.</text>
            <text>But that's not what the immigration laws say.</text>
            <text>As I've indicated in our Joint Appendix and also in the attachment to the reply brief.</text>
            <text>The only way in which one could refuse a visa is on grounds in the law itself or in the regulations and there they don't exist.</text>
            <text>And what we've--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text>Once again, however, the Third Circuit, when you asked me whether or not they had made de novo findings, they obviously did on the most erroneous of fashions.</text>
            <text>That is to say they didn't look at the cross examination and they didn't look at the federal regulations, nor did they look at the Presidential Directive.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald J. Williamson</label>
            <text>He said the policy was embodied in the regulations which the government attorney showed me during my trial preparations.</text>
            <text>There was a three week recess call in which the government was given the opportunity to produce that regulation.</text>
            <text>They didn't, I did.</text>
            <text>I produced the regulation which was the one I referred to in the Federal Register of December of 1946.</text>
            <text>Now in addition to that, since that time we have looked at every conceivable source of historical evidence including the literature at the time, including the INS monthly reviews, the contemporaneously written articles, all of those appear in the Appendix of the amici in support of the petition for certiorari.</text>

            <text>And I think that what we have to do under our system of justice in order for it to work and work effectively is we have to see whether or not it's capable of handling cases like this so that the allegations if not proved don't bear upon the considerations of the other issues.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Klonoff</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>The issue in this case is how to balance two important interests, a naturalized citizens right to citizenship versus the government's need for truthful answers by applicants for visas and for citizenship.</text>
            <text>The issue arises in the context of the case involving willful and deliberate lies at every stage of the process.</text>
            <text>And in answer to Justice Powell's question the record is clear and it's been conceded throughout that these lies were willful, and I would cite to Pages 9A and 46A of the petitioner's Appendix, the decisions of the Court of Appeals and the District Court.</text>
            <text>The Court of Appeals is absolutely clear that these were conceded to be willful.</text>
            <text>And I will get, in detail, during the course of this argument to the nature of these lies because, in fact, a number of misstatements were given during Mr. Williamson's arguments and I want to clear up precisely what the nature of the misstatements were and how they occurred during the proceedings.</text>
            <text>The standard of materiality urged by the government in this case requires proof by clear convincing and unequivocal evidence that there would have been an investigation and that that investigation might have uncovered disqualifying facts.</text>
            <text>Now I think Mr. Williamson confuses two different issues here.</text>
            <text>He indicates that the use of the phrase, "might" somehow dilutes the clear, convincing and unequivocal standard.</text>
            <text>But, in fact, he's confusing two separate issues.</text>
            <text>For example, in the criminal perjury cases the standard of proof is proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text>The question of materiality is whether or not there is a tendency to influence the decision-maker and the question whether there's a tendency to influence the decision-maker has to be proven by a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text>So we submit there's no dilution of the proper standard.</text>

            <text>What the District Court did is it said, let's look at a fact in isolation per se.</text>
            <text>For example, if someone came in and said, I was born in 1915, are you disqualified based on that fact per se?</text>
            <text>If that were the analysis, then virtually no fact of identity would be material.</text>

            <text>The case law at the time was quite clear that it was per se grounds for denial.</text>
            <text>So that's just one avenue.</text>

            <text>Only a small category of misstatements known as identity.</text>
            <text>But, let me pursue it further because wholly apart from the identity point there are additional avenues, one of which is what the Court of Appeals went off on, the fact that the investigation would have revealed that the petitioner was not a victim of persecution and that this was a requirement at the time.</text>

            <text>But, I'm just answering, in terms of the remand, but I'm answering Justice Scalia's question about the avenues of investigation.</text>
            <text>And if we can assume for a moment that Vice Counsel Finger was correct, and if we've noted in our brief and supported historically by the actual numbers of the visas, virtually all of the visas at the time in this part of the world were going to Jews who by definition, were victims of persecution.</text>
            <text>Petitioner himself provided the most important evidence of the existence of the requirement.</text>
            <text>He submitted a document for the very purpose of proving that he was a victim of persecution.</text>
            <text>And finally, petitioner offered evidence at trial, a Mr. Zabarskis, who had testified that he was not a victim of persecution, but nonetheless got a visa.</text>

            <text>We've also given an alternative analysis that doesn't depend specifically on the acceptance of that testimony and that has to do with the issue of good moral character.</text>
            <text>And we would submit that without regard at all to the credibility findings that are made that an individual who lies repeatedly on these critical types of facts has demonstrated a lack of good moral character under the statute and that would provide a basis for disqualification.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Klonoff</label>
            <text>--Well there's a difference and there's a question of overlap.</text>
            <text>We're not saying that any lie, regardless of its significance is enough to show that you lack good moral character.</text>
            <text>What we're saying is, is that here in the context of lies that could have proven a basis for perjury, and we cite the Ramos case for example, that where somebody has repeatedly committed perjury that he has demonstrated a lack of good moral character.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="robert_h_klonoff">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Klonoff</label>
            <text>Well, but the materiality test, again, this assumes just hypothetically, regardless of whatever the Court adopts with respect to Chaunt, the materiality test in the perjury context is well-established.</text>
            <text>And that requires only that there be a tendency to influence the decision-maker and we suggest that under that test of materiality it's clear the petitioner's lies were material for criminal purposes.</text>
            <text>So, regardless of the Chaunt test, we would submit that somebody who is engaged in repeated acts of perjury has established a lack of good moral character.</text>
            <text>Let me briefly, if I could, review the entire scenario of misstatements because they really are quite dramatic in the context of this case.</text>
            <text>Petitioner repeatedly lied about his identity at the very time he was telling the truth to the Germans.</text>
            <text>And it's simply not correct as petitioner would indicate that he also lied to the Nazi Germans.</text>
            <text>And I would refer the Court to Page 117A of the petitioner's Appendix where the District Court found as a fact that all of the documents reflected the, that were submitted to the Germans, both Nazi and after, reflected his true place of birth and almost all reflected his true date of birth.</text>
            <text>So, clearly he was giving truthful information to the Germans.</text>
            <text>It was also found as a fact that he had a identifying document on him with a true place of birth and that he didn't disclose that document to the immigration officials.</text>
            <text>Now, his explanation that he's given, namely avoiding conscription into the German Army simply makes no sense because it doesn't explain why he would tell the truth to the Germans and then lie to the American officials.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Why did he lie to the American officials?</text>
            <text>What's your theory about why he lied to the American officials and told them he was born--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_klonoff">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Klonoff</label>
            <text>Well, the theory we've had--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>--two years later, or earlier.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_klonoff">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Klonoff</label>
            <text>--throughout this case, as is typical of many of the cases that have been brought in this area, people are trying to shade their identities so that they can not be linked with certain atrocities.</text>
            <text>And that goes hand and hand--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But, he wasn't born where the, you know, if he had been born where the atrocities occurred, I could understand it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_klonoff">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Klonoff</label>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But, neither the place where he actually was born, nor the place where he said he was born was the place where the atrocities occurred.</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_h_klonoff">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Klonoff</label>
            <text>--No, but if, for example, someone came in later and provided testimony that the person who they saw and they knew of who committed the atrocities was the person who was born in so and so town, he can come in having lied and said, well that's not me, I was born in a different place and I have a different year of birth.</text>
            <text>But, certainly the most critical lie, we have submitted, is his lie about his residence during the war.</text>
            <text>And his lie has been really a spectrum of lies because he told the immigration officials at the visa stage that he had not resided in Kadainiai.</text>
            <text>For a two year period, he listed just Telsiai.</text>
            <text>He kept changing around so that by the time the investigation occurred of this case he admitted that he was there until the beginning of July, but left right before the atrocities.</text>
            <text>And the District Court specifically found that he was there until October of 1941 and, therefore, was there during the time the atrocities occurred.</text>
            <text>And finally, he lied about his occupation, and there, there's further testimony.</text>
            <text>Vice Counsel Finger indicated that at a minimum, had an individual come in and represented that he had worked in this plant manager capacity, even of say 15 employees, that would have triggered further questioning by the Vice Counsel.</text>
            <text>Now, if I could just discuss briefly the general considerations concerning the test of materiality.</text>
            <text>We would submit that the government's test of materiality, the test we urge is the proper one that this Court should adopt for several reasons.</text>
            <text>First of all, petitioner's standard of materiality creates an incentive for visa and citizenship applicants to lie and then later rewards the person for his successful lies.</text>
            <text>And many of the questions that the Court is asking today, it's troublesome to know exactly what the line of investigation would have been and this is the reason why a standard of what Counsel calls doubt free materiality simply is not right, because the government was denied the opportunity back in 1947, of investigating these facts.</text>
            <text>The government has the right to get the true identity of the person so that it can make the investigation at the time and determine at the time whether or not the person has the necessary requirements.</text>
            <text>So we submit that the government standard properly balances those two interests.</text>
            <text>Secondly,--</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Klonoff</label>
            <text>--our standard, Justice White, is what you suggested in your dissenting opinion in Fedorenko that there would have been an investigation that might have led to the discovery of disqualifying facts and that that has to be proven by clear, convincing and unequivocal evidence.</text>
            <text>And I would say in that regard, in addition to the Attorney General opinion in 1961 endorsing that standard, virtually every court both before and after this Court's Chaunt decision has endorsed that standard.</text>
            <text>The only exception is a split decision by the 10th Circuit and some dictum by the 9th Circuit.</text>
            <text>But, beyond that the endorsement for this point of view has been sweeping and virtually unanimous by the courts who recognize exactly what I'm arguing today this difficult problem where an individual lies about critical information, who he is, and then tries to come in later after he's gotten his citizenship through the lie and then said, well United States you can't show precisely what an investigation would have uncovered 40 years ago.</text>

            <text>If somebody lies about their date and place of birth it is absolutely meaningless to give a name John Smith.</text>
            <text>You just cannot do any investigation of who that person is, so we would submit that the date and place of birth are crucial.</text>
            <text>Congress specified them.</text>

            <text>That truthfulness is a fundamental part of the immigration system and that a standard that gives no attention to that whatsoever is one that really is unworkable.</text>
            <text>Now related to my first point in terms of the incentive to lie is the fact that once there is a lie, either at the visa or the citizenship stage you have deprived the government officials of the opportunity to do their job properly.</text>
            <text>They simply cannot investigate an individual's bonafides if the standard that's endorsed is one that essentially says, which is what petitioner's standard would do, that you can give a completely false identity, because that would be the effect of endorsing the "would-would" standard.</text>
            <text>You could give a completely false identify because no one could say 40 years later that had I given a true name, or had I given a true date of birth those facts per se would have disqualified me.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Klonoff</label>
            <text>--in biographical information he would have referred the case to the immigration officials for deportation proceedings.</text>
            <text>So the naturalization examiner wouldn't personally be involved, but the investigation would be a government investigation into possible prosecution of a deportation.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="robert_h_klonoff">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Klonoff</label>
            <text>So that's how it would work in that context.</text>
            <text>Let me just make a couple of other points and both of these, by the way, are fully supported by a standard of materiality that endorses the criminal standard.</text>
            <text>The standard the petitioner proposes is more onerous than in any other area of the law, criminal, civil, I would refer the Court to the TSC case for example, the tort examples.</text>
            <text>In no other context is there a requirement that you prove an ultimate disqualifying fact.</text>
            <text>Now since Congress did not define materiality in the statute, principals of statutory construction would suggest that you would go to well-established meanings of the term such as the criminal context.</text>
            <text>You would not start from scratch and propose a definition that has absolutely no support anywhere in the law.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Klonoff, before you get off, one thing's troubling me about, let's assume that Finger's testimony is properly evaluated by the Court of Appeals and assume that we can't find any regulation, which you haven't been able to, that says it's only victims of Nazi persecution who would have been admitted on a visa.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Now you say, nonetheless, it would have been a relevant misrepresentation if Finger, on his own was using that as a criteria.</text>
            <text>That would be enough to render the misrepresentation which would have shown that he was not a victim of Nazi persecution relevant--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_klonoff">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Klonoff</label>
            <text>If this were a well-established,--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well-established.</text>
            <text>Suppose it were well-established that Finger was giving preference to blue-eyed people and was not allowing any brown-eyed people in and he writes down blue eyes on the thing.</text>

            <text>What Finger is talking about is a sub-category where you identify the most needy people and you say that these people who have been victims of persecution are going to be the one, the Court has to remember there were many, many people applying for visas.</text>
            <text>Way more than were eligible under the quota system and therefore, a decision on Meade had to be made.</text>
            <text>And we would simply ask therefore, that the judgment of the Court of Appeals be affirmed.</text>

          <heading>Rebuttal of Donald J. Williamson</heading>
          <turn speaker="donald_j_williamson">
            <label>Mr. Donald J. Williamson</label>
            <text>Yes, thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>Justice Scalia, Page 53 of the Joint Appendix contains the initial entry records under the so-called Third Reich.</text>
            <text>The translation of that is on Page 56 of Block Form indicating the date of birth which is the same on the internal passport, Kaunas which is the same as the internal passport, the only differential is Terage, which is a county.</text>
            <text>It's a misstatement of the county.</text>
            <text>So I accurately stated that in fact he did give the same misinformation to the Nazi authorities.</text>
            <text>Insofar as the statement that in 1948, that the courts in connection with whether or not to justify the refusal of a visa or the exclusion upon entry did not hold for materiality.</text>
            <text>I suggest that the government read Pages 25 and 26 of our brief.</text>
            <text>The Second Circuit in Iorio v. Day, a 1929 case which was used as the predicate for a ruling of the attorney general says, it is true that the realtor was bound to tell the truth in his application.</text>
            <text>If what he suppressed was irrelevant to his admission, the mere suppression would not debar him.</text>
            <text>But, I would like to speak to the test because this case gives an excellent illustration as to why the tests should be certitude tests to be consistent with Schneiderman.</text>
            <text>After the Soviet deposition of the sister-in-law was taken, she indicated that she was unaware that her sister was married.</text>
            <text>Based upon that testimony, the government amended the complaint to allege that he misrepresented the fact of his marriage.</text>
            <text>Now it is possible that the petitioner was not married in Lithuania.</text>
            <text>It is also possible that he was married in Lithuania.</text>
            <text>So a possibility test under those circumstances, if that was sufficient to rely on that evidence would have in effect, disqualified this individual under their test, the so-called identity, marriage being a factor and I agree with you when it didn't change his name, he didn't change his identity.</text>
            <text>Now, as to probability Mrs. Kungys testified that she was married in Kaunas on August 24, 1943.</text>
            <text>She submits as part of the INS file of the government, her internal passport, it had stamped on it the marriage bureau of Kaunas with a number.</text>
            <text>The government did not insist before they amended the complaint to allege a misrepresentation of a marriage that the simple fact of requiring the Soviets to produce the marriage register of that date, she gave them the date and the number.</text>
            <text>What the Soviets did is typical of their subjugation of their concept of justice to the interests of the state.</text>
            <text>They waited until after the date that the case was scheduled for trial.</text>
            <text>It was then re-scheduled.</text>
            <text>The Soviets, seven weeks later produced the marriage register of Kaunas, same number, same date that Mrs. Kungys said.</text>
            <text>So, in effect, what you have here is when you require a certitude test on the government, what you are doing is saying government do your job.</text>
            <text>Conduct an effective investigation because if you rely upon Soviet evidence, which is unreliable, you're going to get half truths.</text>
            <text>But if you insist upon certitude and you do your investigation accurately--</text>
