            <text syncTime="20.462" offset="235787">This case is an appeal from an 8-7 decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.698" offset="256684">It involves a facial Constitutional challenge to Louisiana's law for balanced treatment of creation science and evolution in public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.018" offset="290017">That law defines evolution as scientific evidences supporting evolution, and inferences from those scientific evidences.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.891" offset="321468">In parallel, it defines creation science as scientific evidences supporting creation, and inferences from those scientific evidences.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.830" offset="357204">The State today hopes to address two key questions: first, the procedural question of the material factual issues, and particularly, the uncontroverted affidavits, which must be addressed in order to apply the tripart test, and which preclude summary judgment; and then, second, the Constitutional question, particularly of the abundant evidence in the record of a secular purpose, although not an exclusively secular purpose, we concede.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.064" offset="462216">I'll mention the relevant facts in connection with each of these two major issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.499" offset="479875">The first major question is the procedural question which the State believes should be decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.253" offset="502967">The decision under review contradicts the unquestioned procedural rule for summary judgment regarding uncontradicted affidavits and material factual issues, as the seven dissenting judges acknowledged.</text>

            <text syncTime="106.066" offset="578200">And in fact, the eight judge majority did not enter a written opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.952" offset="597739">It simply affirmed; in effect, denied rehearing of the three-judge opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="143.240" offset="726889">The other factual issues raised by the State in its Brandeis memorandum of 630 pages, with nearly 2,000 citations, were not viewed in the most favorable light, like the affidavits, and in fact, were hardly given credence at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.349" offset="779342">They certainly weren't accepted as true for purposes of summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.968" offset="797837">The facts in regard to this procedural issue are that the State filed affidavits by creationist and evolutionist scientists; by a creationist philosopher; an evolutionist theologian; and a creationist educator.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.061" offset="854157">They were not only Protestants, but two Roman Catholics and one agnostic.</text>

            <text syncTime="562.347" offset="2403323">Your Honor, that might be possible given two caveats.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.449" offset="2415757">The first is that the legislative history does involve technical terms of science, not only terms such as creation science and creation and their meaning, but also terms about mathematical probability, paleontology, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.792" offset="2469047">This Court could assume that all of the State's allegations are correct on those factual issues, and in that context, could interpret the legislative history, including those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.950" offset="2517739">Now, the appellees are also arguing that the social context is relevant to a determination of legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.205" offset="2550758">We do disagree with that, particularly where there is a clear legislative history and where there is a clear statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.626" offset="2580433">However, addressing the social context involves questions of history which similarly are factual issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.328" offset="2603212">My second caveat is, if this Court were to apply the purpose prong of the tripartite test, ab initio, it again ought to determine all historical, factual type questions in the light most favorable to the State, just as it should the definitional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.492" offset="2675937">In that sense, it might be possible for this Court to reach a purpose determination based on a full review of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.478" offset="2703835">I'd urge the Court not to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.347" offset="2711359">Because certainly for effect and entanglement, the definitions of terms are highly critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.632" offset="2732466">But if the Court did so, I... I would urge this Court to give the kind of full review of the legislative history I know it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.821" offset="2761200">We have, for the convenience of the Court, in our reply brief, footnotes 56a to 56c, cited some of the most important portions of the legislative history on the purpose to advance academic freedom, students right to hear, by teaching additional scientific information, a nonreligious information.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.533" offset="2832044">It's critical that the legislative history be read in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.652" offset="2848554">It's also critical that the standard applied by this Court, at all times in the past for purpose review, be applied; that it is not necessary to have an exclusively secular purpose; but instead, it is sufficient to have a secular purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.911" offset="2909576">In fact, I think the legislative history in this case indicates a primary secular purpose, although the State does recognize that there are tertiary religious purposes indicated in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="3182.472" offset="12883858">And going back if I may, Mr. Justice Scalia, there wasn't offered here any affidavit from Senator Keith, or any other legislator, about what their purpose was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.263" offset="12930983">They were apparently content, or stuck, with their record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.751" offset="12956897">Now, again, where does this come from?</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.107" offset="12986363">Let me note one unusual fact about one of those five affidavits that Mr. Bird came up with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.927" offset="13009664">He offers an affidavit by a Dr. Terry Meith, who tells us that he's a philosopher and a theologian, and that he possesses three graduate degrees, two doctorates and a Master's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.818" offset="13061178">He even tells us what grade point averages he got at two of the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.388" offset="13079463">He got a 3.94 at one school, and a 3.97 at another school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.959" offset="13101720">I've never seen an expert qualified precisely that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.011" offset="13113945">They usually settle for saying, I was Phi Beta Kappa.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.696" offset="13124707">But okay, he says 3.94 and 3.97 at two schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.434" offset="13147695">He omits USC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.719" offset="13160756">Well, I don't attribute any significance to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.754" offset="13172982">USC I have heard is a rather difficult school, and may be he didn't do so well there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.056" offset="13186147">I'm not going to fault him for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.823" offset="13193253">But the omission I do find significant is in his employment record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.693" offset="13212688">He signed the affidavit in September 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.328" offset="13227212">And he does not state where he was then employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.530" offset="13240064">All of the other affidavits that Mr. Bird submits do give that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.834" offset="13261275">And we found the explanation yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.453" offset="13271724">The affidavit's jurat reads: Lynchburg, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.857" offset="13289383">And just on a hunch, my colleague, Mr. Harper, called Liberty University where Reverend Jerry Falwell is the Chancellor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.313" offset="13335150">And wouldn't you know it, we got right through to Dr. Meith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.367" offset="13351346">He's been on that faculty since 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.484" offset="13363884">And apparently, was not very interested in this case, which deals so much with fundamentalist, with acknowledging where he was employed.</text>
