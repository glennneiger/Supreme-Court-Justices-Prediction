            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="7.586" offset="122078">This case is here from the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.075" offset="135975">It presents a question as to the confidentiality of the State's child abuse records.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.953" offset="163560">In Pennsylvania there is a State agency entitled Children and Youth Services.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.358" offset="189160">Its purpose is to investigate reports of child abuse and state law provides that its record shall be confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.679" offset="226463">The respondent was charged with sexual abuse of his daughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.797" offset="242868">Prior to his trial he sought access to the records pertaining to his daughter claiming that they might contain exculpatory information.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.390" offset="281320">The agency refused to comply with the subpoena and the trial judge denied respondent's request to compel disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.544" offset="313921">Respondent was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.617" offset="322176">On appeal the Pennsylvania Supreme Court disagreed with the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.036" offset="343910">It held that under the Confrontation and the Compulsory Process Clauses of the Sixth Amendment the respondent through his lawyer was entitled, prior to trial to review the confidential records for purpose of obtaining information that might be relevant to his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.418" offset="417366">For the reasons stated in our opinion filed today we affirm in part and reverse in part and we remand the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.369" offset="453206">Respondent, as the defendant on a criminal case, is entitled to have the Trial Court determine whether the agency's file contains information material to his defense, but we also find that respondent is not entitled to examine the confidential records.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.127" offset="528230">The Commonwealth has a compelling interest in protecting the confidentiality of those who provide information on child abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.160" offset="576400">This is an interest that is shared by all 50 states that have similar laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.826" offset="599074">We think the respondent's interest in a fair trial can be protected adequately by having the trial judge examine the records in camera to determine whether and to what extent they contain exculpatory information.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.508" offset="673784">Justice Blackmun has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment; Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Marshall has joined; Justice Stevens also has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Brennan and Marshall and Scalia have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.171" offset="744419">Justice Stevens and the Justices who joined him conclude that the judgment below was not filed for purposes of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.568" offset="777960">Therefore they did not reach the merits of this case.</text>
