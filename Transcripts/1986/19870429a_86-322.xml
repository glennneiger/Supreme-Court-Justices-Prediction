            <text syncTime="61.705" offset="394692">At the conclusion of a long and complicated antitrust case, and after a hearing, Judge Palmeiri, who rendered a decision in favor of the defendants, granted an application for court costs, which included a request for fees involving three experts who testified at the time of trial on behalf of the defendant, yes, Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.997" offset="543799">The... Judge Palmieri approved those costs in two situations, He... Dr. Robers' fees were allowed, and Dr. Saving's fees were allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.958" offset="611717">He disallowed the fees of James Baldwin, a partner with the accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Whinney.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.629" offset="642333">The basis of the allowance of the fees were that these experts materially enabled the court to arrive at the decision the court ultimately arrived at, that is, that the merits of the complaint were meritless; that the circuit court adopted the opinions of these two experts; and that under 54(d) he had the discretion to allow the fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1046.380" offset="4333330">The Woodworkers are arguing that in addition to the fact they say 54(d) does not include this inherent equitable discretion, that Title VII defendants somehow are a different group of litigant, and that we should be held... if discretion exists, we should only get them once Christianburg criteria had been satisfed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.049" offset="4448060">There is no question in this case that the Christianburg criteria were not satisfied, and that if Christianburg is held to apply to expert witness costs, that we would not be entitled to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1467.071" offset="6016138">I think very clearly the first thing that the trial judge would look at what whether our expert witness costs were indispensable to the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1607.145" offset="6576413">Most trial judges believe they can decide the case with very little testimony in some instances; and the expert testimony to them is... may or may not be superfluous.</text>

            <text syncTime="1648.389" offset="6741402">And that if Congress had intended to insulate Title VII plaintiffs from all possible financial responsibility, they would have also insulated them from the presumptively taxable statutory costs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1888.692" offset="7702604">And my position is that where Congress has spoken and given a statutory authorization, the courts certainly may follow that authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.615" offset="7738339">The question that is posed by this case is whether, when Congress has defined a maximum amount, courts may exceed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.887" offset="7775433">Let me start by reviewing briefly the regulation of expert witness fees in the Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.842" offset="7811169">The basic amounts payable to witnesses are defined by 28 USC Section 1821.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.980" offset="7839799">That is a direct successor to the Fee Act of 1863, which prescribed the amounts that were payable to witnesses... that were taxable as costs for witnesses in Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.673" offset="7898522">The Fee Act by its terms covered both law and equity cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.727" offset="7914718">And that now appears no longer to be in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.012" offset="7927884">Equity cases routinely held that the Fee Act governed the taxation of witnesses... witness fees in Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.201" offset="7964664">The Fee Act covered both lay and expert witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.403" offset="7977412">And that was directly the issue faced by this Court in Henkel v. Minneapolis, St. Paul and Omaha Railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.073" offset="8004161">In that case, the expert witness fees had not been governed by the Federal statute, they were awardable under state law, under the rules of decision act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.948" offset="8043658">If they were regulated by Federal statute, they were not so awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.067" offset="8064138">The Court held that they were regulated by the statute that is now Section 1821.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.654" offset="8086499">The Congress has definitely prescribed its own requirement with respect to the fees of witnesses, and I'm quoting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.458" offset="8109696">The Congress has dealt with the subject comprehensively, and has made no exception of the fees of expert witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.646" offset="8138431">Under these provisions, additionally amounts paid as compensation or fees to expert witnesses cannot be allowed or taxed as costs in cases in Federal courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2101.428" offset="8553569">Let's look at what Congress has done and required in Federal Rule of Evidence 706, which is then tied to 28 USC Section 1920 sub 6, with respect to a court appointed, as opposed to a private expert.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.521" offset="8613964">A private expert engages his ingenuity on behalf of his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.175" offset="8636534">That's not wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.127" offset="8640295">That's what he's engaged to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.010" offset="8647923">He presents the strength of his client's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.929" offset="8663596">And in the adversarial system, it is for the adversary to present the weakness in the experts' client's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.368" offset="8697347">The court appointed expert is quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.887" offset="8707378">Rule 706 says, first, that a witness so appointed shall be informed of his duties by the court in writing, a copy of which shall be filed with the clerk or at a conference in which the parties shall have the opportunity to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.896" offset="8763384">Now, when a court informs an expert of his duties, the court says, I would like you to present not only the strengths of one side, but the strengths of the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.704" offset="8810614">I would like you to present not only the weaknesses of the other side, but the weaknesses of the side that you might otherwise have represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.560" offset="8842065">The expert is not part of the adversarial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.612" offset="8858261">He is presenting both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.547" offset="8870068">There's a second portion to that phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.499" offset="8885846">The parties participate in the framing of the instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.986" offset="8903818">And the framing of the instructions to an expert may determine the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.639" offset="8926388">If a party can say, look not just at this market share but at that market share; look not just at this item of business, but at that patent and its effect upon the market; the expert may come to a different conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.149" offset="8988455">Congress has said, with a court appointed expert, both sides get an opportunity to participate in those instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.970" offset="9015727">The rule continues that a witness so appointed shall advise the parties of his findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.457" offset="9033699">He reports to both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.493" offset="9041849">In discovery a private expert's opinions can only be limitedly discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.229" offset="9072778">In this case, the expert is fully available to both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.966" offset="9091691">Congress has made the determination that in this situation expert witness fees in addition to those specified in Section 1821 may be taxed as costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.406" offset="9133487">Congress has comprehensively regulated that situation, and has made choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.012" offset="9167864">To adopt a new rule allowing a broad based grant of expert witness fees in excess of those specified in Section 1821 would substantially disrupt the Congressional provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.140" offset="9232439">And nowhere in fact is that clearer than the case before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.091" offset="9248217">J.T. Gibbons, Inc., is an antitrust plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.977" offset="9263786">Under the antitrust laws, 15 USC Section 15, Congress has provided that a prevailing plaintiff is to recover his reasonable attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.285" offset="9308925">A defendant is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.053" offset="9316031">Congress has struck a balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.589" offset="9326166">And the Court since 1926, the Strauss v. Victor Talking Machine Case, have held that neither side under those antitrust provisions may recover their expert witness fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.830" offset="9383113">So we have a situation in which Congress has said, we wish to favor plaintiffs to a particular degree to encourage private enforcement of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.239" offset="9432746">We know this will burden defendants, but that will discourage them from violating the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.858" offset="9451240">It is a balance that Congress has struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.643" offset="9462421">Neither side is to recover their expert witness fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.047" offset="9479975">This is something Congress has chosen to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.280" offset="9488961">And they have reviewed the antitrust laws, probably as much as any on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.701" offset="9506620">And they have never seen fit to shift the allocation of the burden of expert witness fees from where it sits under statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.557" offset="9542042">The exception proposed by petitioners in this case would substantially disrupt the antitrust laws in that respect.</text>
