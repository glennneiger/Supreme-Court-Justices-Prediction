            <text syncTime="46.211" offset="329142">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="52.715" offset="355160">The issue, simply put, in this case is whether Ohio can punish one as a murder when it is just as likely that they acted in self-defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.709" offset="411062">To more properly isolate the issue, it is important to note that in this case the court instructed the jury that the defendant had the burden of proving that she acted in self-defense by the greater weight of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.634" offset="474801">The court went on to indicate that the defendant must establish that the other party was the aggressor, and the defendant did not herself provoke or cause the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.376" offset="521717">The court then further indicated that if the weight of the evidence is equally balanced, or if you are unable to determine which side has the affirmative defense as to... has the preponderance, then the defendant has not establish such affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.071" offset="584516">In essence, what the court was telling the jury, that if the evidence was in equipoise on the issue of self-defense, then the defendant had failed to establish her defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.443" offset="629969">The critical aspect of this was that this was the defendant's sole defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.997" offset="648254">So in effect, the Ohio law can be understood as indicating that Ohio can, in fact, require a defendant to prove themselves not guilty.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.984" offset="976143">All you're saying... all the self-defense instruction says is that you... if you succeed in putting in enough evidence that you acted in self-defense, you're excused.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.898" offset="1059840">The point is that self-defense is different from all other defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.600" offset="1078648">What the defendant is saying when he asserts self-defense is that he was engaged in lawful conduct, and that he has a right not to be punished for having done this.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.478" offset="1250116">Because inherent in that instruction, of course, is the presumption that what the defendant did was unlawful, and I can develop that.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.049" offset="1280418">Back in 1872, or thereabouts, there was a case in Ohio known as Silvers, which referred to some common law cases out of England, the Forest Crown cases and King v. Winoncby, and at that point, in the Silvers case, the defendant requested an instruction that the jury be told that the defendant... that the state had to prove the lack of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.267" offset="1377280">The court in its... the Supreme Court of Ohio indicated that that would eliminate the presumption that what the defendant had done was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.288" offset="1413433">Now, that presumption is the same presumption that this Court has declared unconstitutional in such cases as Sandstrom, Franklin v. Francis, and other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.478" offset="1450109">We know that even in England, in 1937, the... the House of Lords indicated that that reading of these English cases was wrong; and that those cases, the Forest Crown cases and others, had indicated that the burden was on... the defendant had to prove the lack of provocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.308" offset="1537462">And given that context, which is referred to in Mullaney, we now know from this Court, as I indicated, in Sandstrom and in Franklin, that the presumption is an unconstitutional one.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.365" offset="1585737">So the State of Ohio is getting the benefit of that presumption.</text>

            <text syncTime="505.796" offset="2167431">It referred to it again in McMillian and Patterson.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.164" offset="2180911">And I'm convinced that there are limits beyond which a State cannot go in defining its crimes and in allocatings its burdens of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.537" offset="2214347">Indeed, this Court has gone so far as to say that there are certain facts that need not be elements that have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.209" offset="2249038">That statement was recently indicated in McMillian where it interpreted Patterson as having given rise to that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.446" offset="2277982">And that's exactly what I'm saying here.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.565" offset="2286550">Now, the State of Ohio has indicated that if you prove points... prove fact A, B, C and D, that you have proved unlawful conduct; and therefore, when you raise the issue of self-defense, if you are challenging exclusively unlawfulness, that you are not challenging any of the elements in Patterson.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.943" offset="2356036">Well, let's deal with Patterson.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.410" offset="2361887">Patterson was a situation where New York created a gratuitous defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.013" offset="2380277">It was created by legislative grace.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.382" offset="2393756">The effect of Patterson was that a particular crime was designated as murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.636" offset="2418834">However, the defendant was given the right to reduce that crime from murder to manslaughter upon certain proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.475" offset="2450181">As I read Patterson, what this Court said was that it is all right, and due process considerations are not offended, if New York elects to convict one as a murderer when it it just as likely that they were acting... that they only committed manslaughter because they were acting under extreme emotional stress.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.370" offset="2529698">This is to be distinguished from what Ohio's done.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.806" offset="2539520">Ohio has said, you can convict one as a murderer when it is just as likely that they were acting in self-defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.392" offset="2565851">Now, if self-defense is a basic right, and I contend that it is, then something benefits the defendant, at least to the extent that the State should prove that he was not acting in self-defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.252" offset="2621231">It's significant that 48 of the 50 States require the state to ultimately carry the burden of persuasion on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.158" offset="2656862">Some of the states, Maine and a few others that we can possibly name, have indicated that the defendant has the burden of production, that he has to establish that there is enough evidence in the case to create the issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="883.107" offset="3676682">Are we to say, then, that Ohio can likewise eliminate, by statute, the right of self-defense?</text>
            <text syncTime="890.545" offset="3706462">Now, we talk in terms of the right to self-defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.914" offset="3723911">It's significant that nowhere in the Ohio statutes is that right written in.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.485" offset="3746168">What the Ohio statute says on affirmative defenses is, simply put, that the defendant shall be burdened with proving self-defenses... proving affirmative defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.924" offset="3791934">And then we have these cases... Poole, which relies on Silvers, which takes us back to the English common law cases which have been repudiated by the House of Lords.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.414" offset="3837910">What happens, then, that in Ohio a defendant is burdened to this extent: If the State produces evidence that a crime occurred, a homicide occurred, Ohio is willing to say that if you raise the defense of self-defense, it's confession and avoidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.799" offset="3939474">And I think that's inappropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1155.231" offset="4765152">Because there was no right of self-defense way back yonder in the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.885" offset="4783751">But the jurors would simply not convict in certain circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1174.728" offset="4843206">So the murder charge would be submitted to the jury, and the jury simply would not convict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.465" offset="4870060">So early on in the common law, the concept of self-defense developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.119" offset="4888764">So in answer to your question, Mr. Justice Scalia, jurors would not convict under those circumstances, because traditionally, we have recognized that we have the right of self-defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1367.437" offset="5614027">On November 1st, 1978, the Ohio legislature enacted a law with respect to common law affirmative defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.542" offset="5646419">That law, Section 2901.05, reads as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.863" offset="5667735">Every person accused of an offense is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.267" offset="5697306">And the burden of proof for all elements of the offense is upon the prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1404.979" offset="5764179">The petitioner, at her trial, objected to this jury instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.847" offset="5779644">Consequently, the issue placed before this Court, is whether the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment required the State of Ohio to disprove the affirmative defense of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>

            <text syncTime="1515.282" offset="6205335">And I think that's clearly the case when we see with the Insanity Reform Act of 1984, and Davis v. United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1664.295" offset="6801449">And that's the holding of Engle v. Isaac.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.747" offset="6811271">As I was saying, this Court's decision in Leland and Patterson compel the conclusion that the due process clause is not violated when the legislature places the burden of proof on the defendant to establish the affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence, especially when the affirmative defenses constitute separate matter; and that there's no direct relationship exists between the elements of the crime and the affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.482" offset="6922135">Chronologically, I'd like to start my analysis with the decision of Leland v. Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.670" offset="6950974">The proposition that the petitioner has raised before this Court is certainly not novel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.407" offset="6977828">That same proposition was raised 34 years ago in the Leland case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.145" offset="6996845">There, the individual petitioner contended that to place the burden of proving the defense of... the affirmative defense of insanity upon that individual by proof beyond a reasonable doubt violated the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.171" offset="7060898">In rejecting that claim, this Court noted in Leland, and established the broad Constitutional principle, that due process is not violated where Oregon placed the burden of proof on the defendant to establish a... beyond a reasonable doubt the affirmative defense of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.818" offset="7139474">And contrary to the petitioner's argument that insanity and self-defense are different, they really do not differ in that both are separate matters and both constitute conduct which arguably could be lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.244" offset="7197257">And I think in Leland we look to the Constitutional principles that this Court sought to pass on to us to this very day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.350" offset="7233619">And one of the first arguments they made was that the burden of proof was on the state, consistently, to establish the elements of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.520" offset="7266324">Number two, that the defendant was presumed innocent and the jury given that instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.693" offset="7290984">And number three, that insanity was a separate issue which the state could place the burden of proof on the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.347" offset="7325675">And the vitality and the long life of this decision from 34 years ago survives to this very day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.053" offset="7356499">This Court has had an opportunity to review Leland in Rivera v. Delaware; it had an opportunity to affirm the Leland principle in Jones v. United States; and more recently, the circuit court of appeal, Federal circuit court of appeals, in United States v. Amos, upheld the 1984 Insanity Defense Act, by placing... which placed the burden on the defendant, by clear and convincing evidence, to establish the affirmative defense of insanity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2247.674" offset="9134916">But the Ohio statute was enacted approximately 1-1/2 years after this Court's decision in Patterson v. New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.263" offset="9161351">And I think this is the key case, is Patterson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.480" offset="9170129">Again, the issue in Patterson was whether the due process clause required states to assume the burden of disproving affirmative defenses beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.452" offset="9206073">In rejecting this Constitutional argument, Patterson cited to Leland, and observed the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.539" offset="9230419">Again, that the New York statute in question require that the burden of proof would be on the state to establish its elements of the crime; and second, that the jury was instructed that the defendant was presumed innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.949" offset="9280052">Patterson undertook a quite extensive historical approach to the entire question, noting that in common law, affirmative defenses and the burden of proving these defenses, were properly placed on the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.340" offset="9333655">The historical approach further indicated that this was the rule when the Fifth Amendment was adopted and when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.779" offset="9367405">Patterson is literally a gold mine of some of the most beautiful Constitutional quotations ever issued from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.218" offset="9397080">Patterson stresses, for example, that affirmative defenses are matters separate from the elements of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.289" offset="9429368">They are matters of exception and not negation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.241" offset="9441175">Secondly, there's an implicit recognition in Patterson that the defendants, not the prosecution, are in the best position to know the defense that these individuals seek to assert.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.833" offset="9491539">And lastly, there was an explicit recognition that the states may define their crimes, regulate their procedures, and also, to regulate the burdens of proof as they see fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.808" offset="9543471">The conclusion that I'd like to make that Ohio law, like Patterson, contains numerous similarities both to the Patterson decision and the Leland decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.331" offset="9577534">For example, the Ohio law explicitly states that the burden of proof for all elements of the crime is on the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.520" offset="9610344">And this was the instruction given to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.639" offset="9622778">Secondly, the Ohio statute has a built-in factor that every person is presumed innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.543" offset="9646393">And we would have it no other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.076" offset="9652558">Third, that self-defense was a separate issue under Ohio law, and a recognition that it was a common law approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.850" offset="9691637">And fourth, that the Ohio statute, and the elements of the crime, bear no direct relationship to the elements of the affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.372" offset="9729776">Patterson is significant because it stresses that in determining what facts must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the state legislature's definition of the elements of the defense is usually dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.930" offset="9784006">Consequently, Patterson establishes a bright line standard to be applied, and it's a twofold test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.536" offset="9810442">Number one, first you look to the determination of the elements of the crime for which the petitioner was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.356" offset="9837714">Aggravated murder in Ohio consists of three elements, and that's coming from State v. Martin: It's purposeful, which is the criminal intent portion of the statute, which means a specific intention to kill; prior calculation and design; and lastly, causing the death of another.</text>

            <text syncTime="2931.801" offset="11871503">Finally, I think this Court has recognized both in Patterson, and more recently in McMillian v.

            <label>Mr. James R. Willis</label>
            <text syncTime="3062.103" offset="12392698">Yes, thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.221" offset="12405133">First of all, Ohio's self-defense law has not changed since 1870-something.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.177" offset="12437002">They did change the homicide law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.394" offset="12445779">There is no statutory enactment, never has been a statutory enactment whereby self-defense is defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.283" offset="12473364">The definition of self-defense in Ohio comes from the Supreme Court of Ohio in its opinions in Silvers, Abner and as late as Melchiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.372" offset="12509727">The other interesting aspect of the prosecutor's argument is when he analogizes... I'm sorry, Leland v. Oregon, the insanity case, to the facts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.430" offset="12553926">In an insanity case, the Jury's verdict is, not guilty by reason of insanity, or guilty, but mentally ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.417" offset="12585900">A defendant in an insanity case commits a crime which, if committed by a sane person, would be, indeed, a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.606" offset="12614635">He's claiming that he is not blameworthy because he lacked the... because he lacked the appropriate mens re because of his lack of mental competency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.546" offset="12650475">I think it's also significant with reference to the hypothetical that Mr. Sadd gave us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.580" offset="12666566">Under that hypothetical, in Ohio, he wouldn't be entitled to an instruction on self-defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.401" offset="12689867">Because he would not have done anything he could do to avoid the danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.638" offset="12706795">When the man says, he's going out to get a gun, under Ohio law, he has a duty to retreat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.923" offset="12723931">He's got to leave that bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.459" offset="12730096">He's got to call the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.892" offset="12735843">He's got to barricade himself somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.661" offset="12742844">So under that hypothetical, he would not be entitled to a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.279" offset="12761338">Self-defense and prior calculation and design simply cannot coexist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.600" offset="12778684">And to the extent that self-defense operates in counter-distinction to prior calculation and design, it's an element.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.389" offset="12817763">And to that extent, in Ohio, we feel that the law is wrong on self-defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.109" offset="12840646">There are three points with reference to our position:</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.078" offset="12852558">Self-defense negates the element of criminal purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.763" offset="12867291">Certainly, the state in this instance, has exceeded those constitutional limits this Court spoke about in Speiser.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.302" offset="12897489">And what the defendant engaged in in this case was truly lawful conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.588" offset="12918596">Thank you.</text>
