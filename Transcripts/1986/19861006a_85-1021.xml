            <text syncTime="11.684" offset="183704">Mr. Griswold, you may proceed when you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="64.412" offset="394564">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents the question whether North Carolina may consistently with the supremacy clause and the due process and import-export clauses of the constitution impose an ad valorem property tax on tobacco stored in a United States Customs bonded warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.029" offset="621098">The appellant is in the business of manufacturing finished tobacco products which, quoting from the opinion of the North Carolina Court of Appeals, it sells to wholesale distributors and other authorized purchasers in the United States and abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.223" offset="705839">In its manufacturing process Reynolds uses both foreign and domestic tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.346" offset="738336">The foreign tobacco in this case is placed under Customs bond when it enters the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.999" offset="768951">It is then shipped by Customs bonded carriers and is placed in Customs bonded warehouses in Durham or Forsyth Counties, North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.056" offset="825167">Under the applicable Federal statutes Reynolds does not pay the Customs duties until the tobacco is withdrawn from the warehouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.238" offset="873859">In listing its personal property for 1983, Reynolds claimed that the imported tobacco in the Customs bonded warehouses was immune from state taxation on Federal constitutional grounds, relying on this Court's decision in the Xerox case in 459 U.S., decided less than four years ago in 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.069" offset="1001232">The claims for immunity were denied by the administrative officers, and an appeal to the North Carolina Court of Appeals on constitutional grounds was unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.515" offset="1062986">Reynolds then appealed to the Supreme Court of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.685" offset="1087645">That appeal was dismissed without opinion for lack of a substantial Constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.635" offset="1119515">This Court postponed the jurisdictional question to the hearing on the merits, so I will address that first.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.458" offset="1166744">There are two aspects to the jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.988" offset="1188896">One is whether the appeal should be taken to the North Carolina Court of Appeals or to the North Carolina Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.155" offset="1233617">Out of abundance of caution we filed two jurisdictional statements representing appeals to both of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.761" offset="1271965">We don't care which one is sustained, but we have examined the North Carolina statute in our brief and suggest that the decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court dismissing the appeal there for want of a substantial Constitutional question was on the merits, so that the appeal to that Court is well taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.782" offset="1372066">This is a bootless kind of question which ought to be resolved one way or another, and it would be helpful to practitioners and would save the time of the Court in later cases if the question could be cleared up in this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.619" offset="1447404">The appellants, however, raise another Constitutional question in their brief on the merits, another jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.162" offset="1489617">This is a question which was not presented in the motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.284" offset="1510097">They say that the validity of no state statute was drawn into question in the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.202" offset="1545728">We think that they are wrong in that, and we have answered them in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.137" offset="1573523">I would only point out that the North Carolina Court of Appeals referred specifically to a North Carolina statute, the Machinery Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.477" offset="1622842">This appears in the opinion on Page 17A of the jurisdictional statement appendix, and the North Carolina Court of Appeals then concluded that the tax imposed by that statute is, and I quote, U.S. Constitution&gt; ["], and that appears on Page 18A of the appendix to the jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.012" offset="1732974">This brings the situation squarely within the decision of the Court finding jurisdiction in the Japan Lines case in 441 US and in a case which I have already referred to, the Xerox case, which is virtually identical to this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.128" offset="1821477">In Xerox this Court said an indispensable predicate to an award of judgment to the appellees on their counterclaim was a determination that the taxes at issue were permissible under the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.230" offset="1893888">The Texas Court of Civil Appeals so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.775" offset="1907995">We therefore have jurisdiction to review that judgment, and that would seem to be dispositive of the jurisdictional question here.</text>

            <text syncTime="476.716" offset="2043831">Of course, Mr. Griswold, in the Xerox case the jurisdictional argument was that the decision rested on an adequate state ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.840" offset="2072357">It wasn't the claim that there was no statute drawn in question.</text>

            <text syncTime="490.460" offset="2098793">The decision there was that the Texas statute was unconstitutional, and that's what the Court said in that passage,</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="510.970" offset="2180817">Well, the immediately preceding sentence was,</text>
            <text syncTime="513.875" offset="2192416">"Appellees argue that this Court lacks jurisdiction since the decision of the Texas court reversing the grant of an injunction rested on an independent and adequate state ground. "</text>

            <text syncTime="529.682" offset="2255632">But in this case, as I understand it, their argument is that there is no challenge to a statute within the meaning of the code.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="536.663" offset="2283635">Well, here there was a challenge to the statute expressly recognized by the only court which rendered an opinion in North Carolina, and that court held that the statute was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.612" offset="2331387">The basic question in this case turns in large part on what this Court held in the Xerox case.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.857" offset="2372347">Reynolds submits that the holding there was carefully expressed in the explicit statement on Page 154 of the opinion where the court said,</text>
            <text syncTime="574.085" offset="2433265">"Accordingly we hold that state property taxes on goods stored under bond in a Customs bonded warehouse are preempted by Congress's comprehensive regulation of Customs duties. "</text>

            <text syncTime="592.265" offset="2505990">--Well, Mr. Griswold, true, the court said "we hold" there, but was that actually a holding?</text>
            <text syncTime="599.325" offset="2534202">Isn't that language a little broader than was necessary to decide the case?</text>

            <text syncTime="602.543" offset="2547159">I think not, Your Honor, because this gets back almost to law school analysis of what is the ratio decidendi of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.243" offset="2589895">I think the holding in that case was that there was preemption, and there was preemption because of Congress's comprehensive regulation of Customs duties, and that comprehensive regulation of Customs duties applies to all property in the Customs bonded warehouse regardless of its eventual destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.046" offset="2689160">It is subject to Customs custody, it is subject to bond, and the duties are not payable until it is released from Customs custody, and that is equally applicable to all kinds of property.</text>

            <text syncTime="671.640" offset="2823534">--I think that would put the state very close to a violation of the import-export clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.388" offset="2850493">That state tax would not be due until the property was imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.917" offset="2872644">At that point the state tax would be levied, and that, it seems to me, is hard to distinguish.</text>

            <text syncTime="692.320" offset="2906186">Well, maybe the tax could be levied but it just... the collection would be deferred until the goods leave the warehouse, if they are intended for domestic use.</text>

          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="701.456" stopTime="931.006">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="701.456" offset="2942757">One problem is that in a great many situations you don't know what property is going to be imported and what property is going to be exported.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.641" offset="2983508">You would have to estimate or guesstimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.373" offset="2994479">If that decision is only made when the property is actually released from Customs and used domestically, then it seems to me to be very close to if not identical to a tax on imports.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.287" offset="3074101">Moreover, there would be tied up with this state tax, I suppose, a lien for the state taxes, and a lien for state taxes on property held in a Customs bonded warehouse certainly involves not necessarily conflicts but a little bit like the church-state situation, intermingling between the Federal government and the state governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.821" offset="3192279">We think it would be very difficult to administer, but beyond that the basis for the decision in Xerox, first, the supremacy clause, second, the legislative history, which was reviewed by the Court, and which I will endeavor to show in a moment, was fairly clear that this, the Customs-bonded warehouse was designed to facilitate both transshipment and importation, and finally the fact that Congress has, we say, ratified this Court's decision in the Xerox case together with the fact that there are other passages in the Xerox opinion which make it plain that the Court was aware of this distinction between importation and eventual exportation and specifically clearly decided that that was not relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.543" offset="3483074">That was brought out expressly in the oral argument of the Xerox case.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.069" offset="3525183">The transcript appears in Appendix G of the appendix to the jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.190" offset="3565725">A member of the court addressed the question to counsel for the taxing authorities,</text>
            <text syncTime="864.719" offset="3595818">"So it really does not make any difference in this case as to whether they are destined for a foreign market. "</text>
            <text syncTime="871.231" offset="3621836">to which counsel replied, "Absolutely not", and then when counsel for Xerox was at this podium the following question was asked,</text>
            <text syncTime="883.039" offset="3669066">"well, is an importer who says, yes, these are going to be sold in the United States, and he puts them in a bonded warehouse and holds them for two years, may Texas levy a tax while they are in the warehouse. "</text>
            <text syncTime="898.330" offset="3730297">to which Mr. Hoddinott, counsel for Xerox, replied,</text>
            <text syncTime="903.220" offset="3749836">"No, sir, that is entirely opposed to the legislative purpose of the Warehousing Act. "</text>
            <text syncTime="910.702" offset="3779720">Now, there are, as I have said, there are passages in the Xerox opinion which make it clear that the Court was aware of the distinction between property held primarily for import and property held for export.</text>

            <text syncTime="931.006" offset="3861013">Mr. Griswold, supposing we would agree that you are correct entirely about the construction of the Xerox opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.785" offset="3888076">Is that opinion a constitutional opinion such as it would come under Justice Brandeis's observation in Burnett that stare decisis is less important in constitutional cases than statutory cases.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="949.905" offset="3936559">That is an interesting question because I suppose it was a constitutional decision under the supremacy clause, but decisions under the supremacy clause are rather different than decisions under the due process clause or the equal protection clause because it is a decision which remains entirely in the control of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.738" offset="4047946">If Congress doesn't like the result of this Court's decision in the Xerox case, Congress is constitutionally free to change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.281" offset="4082114">In such a situation, in the absence of further action by Congress, there is every reason to apply the Xerox decision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.606" offset="4119417">Indeed, there has been further action by Congress, which is to accept and approve the Xerox decision, which we think is irrelevant to any question as to whether the Xerox decision should be narrowed or qualified or overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.769" offset="4208024">The basic purpose of stare decisis is to provide rules on which the lower courts, government officers, private practitioners may rely with a measure of confidence, and a failure to apply stare decisis in a situation like this simply invites relitigation of decided questions, thus contributing to the uncertainty of the law and to the burden of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.991" offset="4328919">Now, I have already referred to the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.488" offset="4358907">It is perhaps a little odd to be dealing with legislative history that is 140 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.264" offset="4397986">But I think the fact that this statute is 140 years old is highly relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.637" offset="4423482">These Customs bonded warehouses have been in active operation for 140 years, and it is perfectly plain that Congress likes them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.087" offset="4469248">Indeed, it likes them so much that in the statute of two years ago it extended this Court's Xerox decision to foreign trade zones, which are a new development going back, I think to about 1930, expanding since World War Two, where broader operations are allowed, goods can be put on display, they can be manufactured, packed, various other things, and people can come in and look at them and decide whether to buy them or not, and following the Xerox decision counties in Texas, the same as in Xerox, threatened taxes on goods in foreign trade zones, and Senator Tower and a Congressman from Texas introduced bills, the Committee reports both refer explicitly to the Xerox decision, and Congress enacted a statutory provision which extended the Xerox decision to foreign trade zones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.831" offset="4828275">The full text of the statute is on the bottom of Page 27 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.547" offset="4859100">Incidentally, although the statute was passed late in 1983, the last line on Page 27 shows that the amendment shall take effect on January 1, 1983, which was 18 days after this Court's Xerox decision on December 13th, 1982, and the statute provides that tangible personal property imported from outside the United States and held in a zone for the purpose of storage, sale, exhibition, repackaging, assembly, distribution, sorting, grading, cleaning, mixing, display, manufacturing, or processing, shall be exempt from state and local ad valorem tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.618" offset="5075394">But I also call the Court's attention to the fact that the statute went beyond this Court's decision in Xerox because it also provides that tangible personal property produced in the United States and held in a zone for exportation either in its original form or as altered by any of the above processes shall be exempt from state and local ad valorem taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.527" offset="5215097">Now, there is nothing in the Xerox case that applies to goods produced in the United States and taken into a Customs bonded warehouse because the Customs bonded warehouses aren't available for such goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.083" offset="5269327">They are under Customs control, and that is only applicable to goods which are brought into the United States, but Congress so liked the idea of tax exemption in these foreign trade situations that in this statute of 1984... incidentally, enacted after this case was first started in the North Carolina courts... Congress has not only completely ratified the Xerox decision, but has extended it beyond anything this Court old or needed to do or could do.</text>

            <text syncTime="1502.263" offset="6145996">That is covered quite fully in our brief and in Appendices B and C to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.510" offset="6191031">Appendix B is the committee report of the House, and Appendix C is two speeches by Mr. Dix, a Senator from New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.737" offset="6251844">Our opponents in their brief say that what the legislative history shows is that Congress was interested in encouraging import of goods for transshipment so that they could be assembled here and then sent on elsewhere, but we point out that of the first seven pages of the committee report it was related to goods which would be imported, and after that they said, besides, or the second reason why it is useful is for the transshipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.684" offset="6455704">But I would like to call particularly to the speech of Senator Dix in the Senate on July 9th where he was replying to a contention that the British system of Customs warehouses on which this legislation was based, that it required that goods be designated when they went into the warehouse as to whether they were for import or whether they were for eventual transshipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.922" offset="6580674">And he says that his studies show that this applied only to goods which could not be legally imported into Great Britain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.028" offset="6625082">They will be allowed to be taken into the warehouse, but they had to be designated as for export.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.789" offset="6656115">He points out in his Paragraph 4,</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.460" offset="6670744">"No goods which have been warehoused can be taken out except upon due entry for exportation or upon due entry and payment of the full duties payable thereto for home use. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.532" offset="6727064">This shows that the election is made on withdrawing the goods from warehouses and not on warehousing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.702" offset="6759769">And then in his Paragraph 3 on Page 25A he says,</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.263" offset="6782026">"All other goods excepting those comprehended in the two foregoing classes may be imported and warehoused either for home consumption or exportation without any declaration at the time of the entry whether they are intended for one or the other, thus making it quite clear that the Congress intended and understood that warehousing to apply to all imports regardless of their eventual destination.

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="1698.203" offset="6929774">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the basic question in this preemption case is whether the petitioner has met its heavy burden of showing that Congress really intended to take away the power of state and local governments to impose a non-discriminatory property tax under the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.381" offset="7014515">This case simply is not Xerox.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.817" offset="7020262">The holding doesn't apply and the rationale squarely supports the holding of the North Carolina courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.596" offset="7047325">There is one factual feature of the case that distinguishes Xerox and controls its outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.405" offset="7078568">The Xerox Corporation had an option in between the time that those machines were manufactured in Mexico and sold in some country other than the United States, Spanish-speaking or Portuguese-speaking, to warehouse those machines either in an American warehouse or some warehouse other than in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.226" offset="7161846">In the event that it elected to warehouse here, then some American port will get the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.223" offset="7185879">In this case there is no corresponding option available to Reynolds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.861" offset="7204373">These goods, unlike the goods in Xerox, as Mr. Griswold has pointed out, are not for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.374" offset="7234466">They are for manufacture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.967" offset="7240840">The only reason that Reynolds buys tobacco is to make it into cigarettes, and the only place in the world that it manufactures cigarettes is in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and as a consequence that means that its foreign leaf tobacco must come in through an American port.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.570" offset="7311266">There is no other option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.476" offset="7314819">It will come in through an American port.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.567" offset="7323178">And the only competition affected by this case is not American ports versus foreign ports, it is American tobacco growers versus foreign tobacco growers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.454" offset="7362780">Reynolds does not challenge and could not challenge the finding, and I am quoting it, that</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.828" offset="7380230">"none of the imported tobacco in bonded storage was being held for export by Reynolds. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.905" offset="7396530">and in fact none of it ever has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.230" offset="7405830">In light of that unequivocal finding, the issue comes down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.713" offset="7427773">Can Congress be assumed to have intended to exempt more than a half billion dollars worth of foreign tobacco that has come permanently to rest in this country from the same property tax that American grown tobacco must pay when the two impose identical demands on county and city resources and are used for identical purposes, namely, they are the manufacturing inventory for the owner's American plant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1850.389" offset="7538532">Mr. Lee, the Xerox opinion contains rather broad language, although on its facts we have there a situation of goods intended for export.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.589" offset="7579283">But the Xerox opinion relied in part on a D.C. Circuit opinion called District of Columbia versus International Distributing Corporation, and that opinion in turn seemed to suggest to me that the state lacked jurisdiction to tax property in these bonded warehouses because they have not yet been in fact imported.</text>

            <text syncTime="1887.171" offset="7685653">So it seemed to me that perhaps to that extent there is a problem in your argument about the meaning of the Xerox opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1896.309" offset="7722225">Well, let me answer it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.901" offset="7728599">The Xerox opinion, first of all, let me say, there is the one, there is the sentence at the end, but the sentence at the beginning says,</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.882" offset="7764439">"We noted probable jurisdiction to decide whether a state may impose non-discriminatory ad valorem and personal property taxes on imported goods stored under bond in a Customs warehouse and destined for foreign markets. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.395" offset="7806548">Now, the petitioner, to be sure, does have this argument that up until the time that the goods are actually taken out of Customs bond, that they are not within the jurisdiction and therefore not within the power, and there is the dictum that is relied on from the District of Columbia case and also from an older case from Bree versus Murphy of some time ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.681" offset="7903619">Neither of those... two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.805" offset="7912187">One is that neither of those cases involved the problem that is involved here, but Bree versus Murphy did not even involve state taxes at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.803" offset="7940190">It involved only the Customs, only the Customs duty itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.177" offset="7953670">It would make, Justice O'Connor, the state's constitutional rights to exercise their most important governmental function, the power to tax, which is the power on which all other governmental powers depend, turn on a wooden formalism, and that is, it would turn on which side of a yellow line in a Class II Customs bonded warehouse those goods happened to be on, and I simply submit that it is--</text>

            <text syncTime="1987.773" offset="8088044">Although in this case apparently it is conceded that the tobacco will be for domestic use, there may be a variety of products put in these warehouses where the importers aren't certain yet whether they will be reexported or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2010.498" offset="8178950">The first is to observe that... three steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.028" offset="8197026">The first is to observe that, as you correctly state, that is not this case, and therefore does not have to be decided in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.668" offset="8219596">All that you have to decide in this case is that where there is--</text>

            <text syncTime="2023.403" offset="8230568">Well, but you would certainly have to have in mind what you were going to do.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="2026.980" offset="8244883">--The next step down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.152" offset="8249585">But so long as we are... we recognize, first of all, that we are really deciding the next case and not this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.259" offset="8273931">My second point is that I don't think it is terribly... it is not either necessary nor even helpful to speculate on what that circumstance would be because history teaches that in the context of this particular Warehousing Act that by the time the case has reached this Court that question will have been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.156" offset="8357523">In Xerox, for example, it was very clear by the time... on the record by the time the case got here that all of those machines were destined for transshipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.277" offset="8394094">In McGoldrick it was very clear on the record that all of that fuel was to be used on vessels in foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.792" offset="8420112">And in this case it is undisputed that all of these goods are going to be manufactured into tobacco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.007" offset="8452922">It would seem that whatever the circumstance might have been in 1846, when there might be this uncertainty, that with the improved telecommunications of today's modern world, that that will not be a serious problem, and as a consequence I would say that the only thing you really have to decide is today's case and that you don't have to anticipate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.045" offset="8537141">Now, the final and my third point is that in the event that you do, as I would urge you not to, I think the fair way to handle it if the exporter, if the taxpayer doesn't know whether he is going to ship it or not, pay the tax, and then in the event that he does transship it, the laws of the state of North Carolina give him a remedy to sue in the event that he... that that should eventually be the holding, that he is entitled to it, to get the tax back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.691" offset="8651661">And this brings me back to the standard by which to determine what was Congress's real intent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.890" offset="8676530">Did Congress really intend to take away the power to tax under these circumstances?</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.997" offset="8704951">And a helpful starting point is a brief review of the threshold of proof that must be made in order to establish that proposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="2160.989" offset="8780915">The power to tax is not only a core governmental function, it is the function on which all others depend, and because under Garcia Congress is the principal protector of the state's constitutional rights of self-governance, we submit that it follows that Congress should not be assumed to have taken that responsibility lightly, and that Congress should be assumed to have intruded into the state's taxing power only if Congress itself makes that intent very clear, and this case simply doesn't arise to that standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2292.219" offset="9305872">And my point, Justice Scalia, is that while you may have been able... no, excuse me, while you can properly infer an intent from the general Congressional purpose or you do have the clean facts of a completely international journey, it is an entirely different matter under facts such as these.</text>

            <text syncTime="2366.736" offset="9603877">Two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.610" offset="9611400">The first is that that is an argument that would support Justice O'Connor's point of view, that you defer the state tax until such time as the Federal tax is imposed, but let me tell you why that... they really weren't talking about that kind of ribbon matching between Federal Customs duties on the one hand and tax exemption on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.227" offset="9689872">It will take me just about 30 seconds to give you that answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.805" offset="9704187">The first is, and I want to emphasize this, that is not what the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.334" offset="9722264">It says nothing, neither the language nor the legislative history says one word about exemption from state taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.267" offset="9757999">Now, in addition, there is a regulation, and this goes directly to your point, Justice Scalia, there is a regulation that is cited at Footnote 24 of our brief, and I quote it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.121" offset="9801467">It requires the private bonded warehouse owner, this is the warehouse owner, and I am quoting now,</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.293" offset="9818081">"to provide an estimate of the maximum duties and taxes. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.728" offset="9839815">duties and taxes, Footnote 24,</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.883" offset="9852458">"which will be due on all merchandise in the bonded warehouse. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.366" offset="9866460">Now, the significance of that regulation is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.928" offset="9876700">The rule for which Reynolds is contending is a per se xx that once it is in the warehouse it is exempt from taxing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.689" offset="9911704">There is no way you can square that with a regulation that refers to taxes which will be due, and that was not the Customs duties they were talking about because it refers to duties and taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.497" offset="9962904">That leaves you with the only argument that Reynolds has, one which I would like to concentrate on now, that a blanket exemption can nevertheless be inferred from the more general purposes of the statute, and it is true that the two primary purposes of the Federal tariff laws as developed by our brief are, first, to gather revenue, and second, to protect American businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.458" offset="10046809">And in Xerox the Court inferred an intent to exempt where the goods were destined for foreign transshipment, and it is very clear and, I think, very proper that the reason is because of the favorable competitive effect on American ports, and as I believe it was you pointed out, Justice Scalia, that distinction between... good, yes, it was you... that are to be transshipped and that are not to be transshipped is recognized in the Warehousing Act, which imposes no Customs duty on imported goods destined for foreign markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.569" offset="10171257">Now, if you take that Xerox rationale and apply it to the facts of this case, you will affirm, because the only American industries whose competitive standing is at stake in this case are the American tobacco producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.593" offset="10239279">And like... in Xerox, Reynolds does not need any Federal incentive to bring its foreign grown leaf tobacco into this country for manufacture here rather than manufacturing some place else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.729" offset="10283897">The only place it can manufacture is in Winston-Salem, and it did so long before it challenged this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.883" offset="10316497">In the most elementary sense, in the most elementary sense, the result for which Reynolds is contending here is a subsidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.365" offset="10342411">The Court in American Smelting called it a bounty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.911" offset="10356621">Enacted into law by an American Congress available only to foreign businesses and working to the competitive disadvantage of American businesses, Reynolds manufactures from a blend, a certain percentage of foreign and a certain percentage of domestic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.653" offset="10431541">If my clients lose this case the comparative costs of the two components of that blend are going to change, and it will be to Reynolds' economic advantage to increase the percentage of foreign tax-exempt tobacco, and I return to the question, why would Congress want to do that?</text>

            <text syncTime="2673.101" offset="10829333">The foreign tobacco constitutes, Mr. Chief Justice, about 40 percent... excuse me, 42 percent of Reynolds' total taxable property, at least in Forsyth County, and the record is silent as to what it is in Durham.</text>

            <text syncTime="2742.777" offset="11108008">Let's just face the question directly, and let's say then that Reynolds did go to Congress and performed its obligation that it has to get the statute through, and it proposed a bill that would exempt tobacco grown in Bulgaria and Syria from property taxes that have to be paid by tobacco grown in Maryland and Virginia.</text>

            <text syncTime="2879.864" offset="11656370">And to the extent that it shows anything at all, that legislative history simply shows that Congress has treated one statute different from another simply because of the fact that the activity is different.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="2892.813" offset="11708197">Several ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.750" offset="11711959">The most important way, Justice O'Connor, is that they are in effect... not in effect, the statute says they are public utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.093" offset="11733275">And that means that any secrets that Reynolds has in connection with the blend and its manufacturing process would have to be sacrificed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.589" offset="11767338">They are open to the public, to all comers, whereas the bonded warehouses, these two kinds that are used here, are private, and there is a great variety of activities that goes on within these foreign trade zones.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.333" offset="11818329">Most important for our purposes, they are subject to two different kinds of statutes, and they are subject to different statutory provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.144" offset="11841526">They are not identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.877" offset="11844452">As my colleague, Mr. Griswold, has pointed out in the case of foreign trade zones, domestic goods that come in for foreign transshipment are exempt from property taxes, and Congress has not done that with respect to the Warehousing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.668" offset="11907668">Now, the statements by Senator Tower and Congressman Wright, the most that you can get out of those is that they may have read, may have read the Xerox decision the same as Mr. Griswold does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.241" offset="11961898">I don't think they were even focusing on the problem in this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.411" offset="11978617">I think the most that the legislative history shows is what Senator Bentsen says, that, and I am quoting, that we are dealing with a very narrow problem dealing with foreign trade zones in the state of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.593" offset="12027309">They were simply concentrated... it was easier to get a Congressional statute passed than it was to amend the constitution of the state of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.652" offset="12063567">But even if you read those statements as favorably as possible to Reynolds, they cannot possibly qualify as any kind of legislative history of the Warehousing Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2999.770" offset="12135978">It at least would support that notion, and that was repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.721" offset="12159802">We think the repealer supports us, but I hadn't planned to mention it because in Xerox the Court said, we won't speculate on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.688" offset="12183730">Since the Court has given that advice, I will follow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.233" offset="12197836">But there is the remaining regulation, and this one, I think, is a powerful one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.245" offset="12221973">The remaining regulation says that it is the obligation of the private bonded warehouse owner to provide a list of all duties and taxes that will be due.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.523" offset="12263038">That is on, as I say, Footnote 24 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.148" offset="12273487">There is no way you can reconcile that with the position that Reynolds is taking in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.255" offset="12297937">Two final points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.521" offset="12307028">One is that there is only one case in which this Court has squarely decided this issue on the merits, and that is the summary dismissal of the appeal in American Smelting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.657" offset="12355616">That is the only case that involved the precise facts of this case, namely, where you had raw materials, manufacturing inventory in a bonded warehouse awaiting manufacture in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.885" offset="12412458">And while we recognize that a summary disposition does not carry as much precedential weight as does a decision following full briefing and argument, it does carry precedential weight, and this fact remains, and this is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.363" offset="12466375">If you look at holdings, affirmance of the North Carolina courts will not require overruling any merits decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.609" offset="12503364">Reversal will.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.797" offset="12512141">Now, finally, let me say just a word about the constitutional arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.655" offset="12535547">We think that they follow a fortiori from the statutory interpretation issue, particularly in light of this Court's decisions in Michelin versus Wages and Wisconsin versus J.C. Penney, and that the overarching principle that governs both of those is the principle well embedded in this Court's jurisprudence that foreign commerce must pay its fair share.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.924" offset="12644635">The Court said in Wisconsin versus J.C. Penney that the simple but controlling question is whether the state has given anything for which it can ask in turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.201" offset="12689774">It is that simple but controlling question, we submit, which governs this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.542" offset="12711090">These two counties and these three cities have given something, the full range of governmental services from fire to police to education to streets and parks directly attributable to the presence of Reynolds tobacco in these warehouses in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.223" offset="12781830">All that they ask in return is that the foreign tobacco pay its fair share, the same as the share that is paid by tobacco grown in North Carolina and other neighboring states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.046" offset="12829164">Unless the Court has questions, Mr. Chief Justice, I have nothing further.</text>

            <text syncTime="3184.558" offset="12875139">With respect to Justice O'Connor's question about deferral, it seems to me that that is an argument, as much of Mr. Lee's argument is, which ought to be addressed to Congress and not to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.253" offset="12945983">It was already indicated, Mr. Lee indicated that if there wasn't... that deferral might require payment now and then North Carolina would somehow or other provide a refund if it wasn't eventually imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.981" offset="13020902">I suggest that that is a fairly complicated legislative process which ought to be left to the legislative branch of the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="3252.170" offset="13145663">That, I think, quite obviously is a reference to Federal excise taxes, which are applicable to liquor, to many other things which from time to time are subject to excise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.962" offset="13200834">I remember back in World War One when candy was subject to an excise tax.</text>
