            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="149584">We will hear argument now in No. 85-1233, International Paper Company versus Ouellette.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.670" offset="184170">Mr. Reardon, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="roy_l_reardon" startTime="12.641" stopTime="300.411">
            <label>Mr. Roy L. Reardon</label>
            <text syncTime="12.641" offset="200053">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a class action brought by citizens of Vermont who own property on the Vermont side of Lake Champlain.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.631" offset="252088">The State of Vermont is also a plaintiff in this case because of its property ownership on the same side.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.369" offset="279047">The petitioner here has a paper mill on the New York side of Lake Chaplain and discharges effluent into Lake Champlain in connection with the manufacture of paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.481" offset="339442">The petitioner is regulated by New York State, which is part of the procedure set up under the Clean Water Act which supplements the regulation which the Act provides initially by the EPA, the Federal EPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.025" offset="417600">In this particular case the permit is supervised in a very detailed way and the plant policed by the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.298" offset="454694">While there is a challenge in the case to the manner in which the petitioner has performed under the permit the basic thrust of the lawsuit, at least in this phase, is a common law claim of nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.058" offset="513731">The plaintiffs here, the respondents in this Court, seek compensatory damages of $20 million and punitive damages of $100 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.282" offset="558662">The petitioner moved to dismiss in the District Court, and basically the District Court held decision on that motion pending the resolution of what we refer to as Milwaukee III, which is the Seventh Circuit opinion which is referred to very fully in the briefs of both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.064" offset="645806">The motion to dismiss by the petitioner was predicated on the decisions of this Court in Milwaukee I and Milwaukee II and by reason of the amendments to the Clean Water Act in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.039" offset="693662">Now, as the Court has very fully discussed in its two opinions to which I have referred, the Act is an extremely comprehensive Act which covers the field with respect to pollution of navigable waters and interstate waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.333" offset="770880">There is basically regulation by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.487" offset="787494">The Act permits supplementation of that on more or less a dual regulatory basis by the states with the states being able to take over and assume the regulation to the extent that the state regulation equals or exceeds in terms of stringency what the Federal requirements are.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.282" offset="862622">The Federal requirements are obviously technical in nature, dealing with the extent to which obvious discharges from manufacturing facilities are permitted to be injected into interstate waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.541" offset="923644">There is within the framework of this Act a very careful balance between the position of the Federal Government and the Federal regulation and the position of the source state, and provides amply for source state regulation, indeed for the total displacement of Federal regulation by enabling the states to take over to the extent that their requirements meet or exceed the requirements of the EPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.693" offset="1032314">Under the permitting procedure, to the extent one does not obtain a permit you are in fact in violation of the law and acting illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.000" offset="1073483">The permitting procedure if handled by the Federal Government basically calls upon the EPA to give adequate notice to those states, including the source state, which could be affected by the issuance of the permit, so everyone gets an opportunity to be heard within the framework of Federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.295" offset="1150701">To the extent the states assume that role by reason of their own regulations, equal to or more stringent than those of the Federal Government, similar notice is given to affected states, non-source states, so that they again may be given the opportunity to participate in the permitting procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.410" offset="1239204">Now, within the framework of that Act it seems to me that there is before this Court two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.933" offset="1273267">Simply stated, the first issue is the extent to which Vermont law can be applied with respect to what has happened here anti what is involved here, and secondly, the extent to which there may be jurisdiction within the Vermont courts to hear the matter under the provisions of the Clean Water Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1109.842" offset="4588937">The unique feature of nuisance is if the Court concludes there is in fact a nuisance, the great danger will be that the only relief is abatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.113" offset="4626031">And if it isn't abatement, if you do not abate, you run the risk of continuing damage every day you keep the nuisance in place, so to that extent in... as distinguished from any other tort, when you are dealing with a tort of nuisance, you are dealing with something much more potent and as equally regulatory as the remedy of abatement or the remedy of punitive damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1614.245" offset="6606531">There was a comparable statute on the books and when Justice Douglas's opinion came out in Milwaukee I, it gave no heed to that provision as preserving states' rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1709.788" offset="6988650">The reason that we think Vermont law applies is, first of all, under traditional choice of law provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2643.163" offset="10722175">And the other relief that can be secured is civil penalty relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.567" offset="10755821">We have discussed this on Page 14 of our brief, and we show there that any civil penalties secured are shown by the legislative history to be payable to the Federal Treasury, not to the plaintiffs in such cases, and this Court held in the Sea Clammers case in 453 US that there is no implied right of action under the Federal statute for damages by someone claiming to be damaged by violation of the permit standards nor can a 1983 suit be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.846" offset="10924885">What the Court did not address in Sea Clammers and what is before the Court today is whether suits can be brought under state nuisance law for damages and for other relief, and that is what we are here to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.657" offset="11004193">Our answer to whether the Court of Appeals correctly decided this case is yes and no, but mostly yes, and certainly yes in its result of refusing to order dismissal of the complaint, and if the Court please, I will briefly summarize our position and then proceed to the reasons why.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.660" offset="11116206">We agree that a state court and by extension a Federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction can entertain respondents' state law claims for compensatory damages, punitive damages, and injunctive relief, and as to compensatory damages the Court sitting in Vermont can and should apply either Vermont or New York law, depending on Vermont's choice of law rules, but as to punitive damages or injunctive relief we believe the effect of the Federal law is to preserve only the law of the source state and thus to require the Vermont court to apply New York law, including New York choice of law principles.</text>
