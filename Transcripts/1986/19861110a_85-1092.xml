            <text syncTime="62.906" offset="404154">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="65.692" offset="415230">This case involves two Constitutional provisions, the takings clause and the contract clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.929" offset="444174">The principle that controls the takings issue is simple and well established.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.833" offset="467789">Sixty-four years ago this Court held in Pennsylvania Coal v. Mahon that regulation which goes too far amounts to an unconstitutional taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.224" offset="517421">And specifically, it held that the State of Pennsylvania went too far when it required anthracite coal owners to leave certain coal in the ground in order to serve a public purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.830" offset="559844">There is, very simply, no meaningful distinction between Section 4, which is one of the two sections of the statute at issue today, and the Kohler Act, which held... which Pennsylvania Coal held unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.339" offset="621807">Indeed, the parallels between the two statutes are remarkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.243" offset="641451">The operative language in the Kohler Act was as follows: It shall be unlawful for any owner so to mine anthracite coal as to cause subsidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.265" offset="681575">Whereas its modern day counterpart, Section 4, states that no owner shall mine bituminous coal so as to cause damage from subsidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.721" offset="715325">The one deals with anthracite, and the other, bituminous.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.506" offset="734551">But that's the only real difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.290" offset="745627">If Pennsylvania Coal is still good law, as this Court has stated on many occasions that it is, the then Third Circuit's judgment in this case must be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.830" offset="783766">The controversy arises out of the following circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.115" offset="796932">Pennsylvania law recognizes three separate property interests, or estates in land: the mineral estate; the surface estate; and the support estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.692" offset="847296">My clients' Constitutional rights are based on the right that as to most of their properties, they have acquired two of these three estates.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.881" offset="883972">And it's important to understand why it is that they acquired the support estate in addition to the coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.416" offset="902153">Most of Pennsylvania's bituminous coal, which is located in the western part of the State, lies hundreds of feet below the ground and is extracted by underground mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.390" offset="946039">When that happens, the surface will subside.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.025" offset="964638">In some cases, the subsidence will cause damage, and in other cases, it doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.579" offset="986790">And it is impossible to predict in advance which parcels will be damaged by subsidence, and which will not.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.750" offset="1011449">Two facts, then, bring the interests of the coal owners on the one hand and the surface owners on the other into an obvious conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.439" offset="1046244">On the one hand, coal in the ground has no value unless it can be mined.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.324" offset="1065784">It's worthless unless it can be mined.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.843" offset="1071844">Yet on the other hand, the underground mining of any coal in any quantity creates some risk of subsidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.180" offset="1101206">So that if it isn't mined, it's valueless.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.567" offset="1118760">And if it is mined, there will be subsidence, and there may be some damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.054" offset="1140703">In the case of about 90 percent of the bituminous parcels in Pennsylvania, these competing interests have been accommodated, and the relevant burdens and risks have been shifted by contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.751" offset="1471518">Insofar as... and let me draw the distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.987" offset="1480399">In the Pennsylvania Coal case, there was a case that the majority... that the Court distinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.474" offset="1510388">It was called the Plymouth Coal case, which dealt with the requirements for mine safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.210" offset="1529301">I think that when the coal miners engage in a certain kind of activity, then the State has the right to regulate that activity in such a way as to make it safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.685" offset="1579247">But when they go beyond that, and attempt to take property in such a way as to... as to protect other property, then that's the point at which it goes too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.195" offset="1637239">And that, we submit, is the necessary holding of Pennsylvania coal.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="376.616" stopTime="386.287">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="376.616" offset="1658972">Well, but applying that to protection of aquifers and utility lines: What is your view?</text>
            <text syncTime="385.537" offset="1694603">I'm not clear.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="386.287" stopTime="438.718">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="386.287" offset="1697634">Our view is... now, of course, aquifers and utility lines is different factually from what happened in Pennsylvania Coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.357" offset="1725950">But we don't think that it's a different... there's a difference in concept, and we don't think that the legal rule is different insofar as aquifers and utility are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.296" offset="1761686">It's not private property; public property in a sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.664" offset="1775165">But it involves the same principle, that if Pennsylvania wants to accomplish its purposes... and certainly those are proper purposes... that there comes a point at which regulation goes too far, if it takes too much, if it regulates too much, then it goes too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.006" offset="1836501">And the necessary holding of Pennsylvania Coal is that when coal has only one value, unlike the situation in Penn Central, where there were other values, and unlike all of the other cases, when it only has one value, then if Pennsylvania eliminates that value, it has gone too far.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="438.718" offset="1907345">Well, as I understand it, the State requires only a small percentage of the coal to be left in place, from one to nine percent?</text>

            <text syncTime="448.157" offset="1945170">No, that is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.073" offset="1952798">Let me clarify the answer to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.709" offset="1959276">And let me compare it in that respect, to the Kohler Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.411" offset="1978084">Note the parallels in the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.696" offset="1991250">Both simply said you can't... you can't mine anthracite or bituminous in such a way as to cause subsidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.619" offset="2026985">Neither statute said you have to leave so much in the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.938" offset="2048197">It was assumed however in the Pennsylvania Coal case that the amount that would be required to be left in the ground was about a third.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.311" offset="2085709">And that's in the opinion, mostly in the argument portion of the opinion, in Pennsylvania Coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.282" offset="2109637">In the case of the modern day counterpart to the Kohler Act, in the case of Section 4, the State of Pennsylvania in 1982 adopted regulations which require that 50 percent of the coal underlying certain designated surface structures be left in the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.279" offset="2185601">Now, the one percent to nine percent that they're talking about is the percentage of the coal that has to be left in the ground, that is, the 50 percent under surface structure; the percentage that that is to the total coal holdings of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.073" offset="2252788">But they're the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.340" offset="2261879">The only difference in that respect is that where it was assumed in Pennsylvania... and apparently correctly, because that's what the lower court said as well... was that you had to leave 30 percent of the anthracite.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.513" offset="2298554">We are required to leave 50 percent of the bituminous.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.715" offset="2311302">So that these contractual arrangements that were made mostly between the years 1890 and 1920, carefully shifting the burdens between the parties, among the parties that are affected, have been rearranged by the State of Pennsylvania.</text>

            <text syncTime="1704.335" offset="6969875">I'm not sure that that difference in itself, and we don't argue that that difference in itself, makes the case distinguishable from Pennsylvania Coal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1717.409" offset="7022120">The coal companies do not contest the fact, as well, that this program accomplishes these broad purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.897" offset="7048034">The coal companies admit that the government may regulate the use and enjoyment of property, even though the regulation in particular cases may affect property values adversely, and sometimes substantially.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.454" offset="7098293">They admit as well that the effect of these regulations on their coal mining operations is relatively small.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.710" offset="7127341">As the Court noted in the chart we that we have prepared as part of the Joint Appendix, as little as four-hundreths of one percent of a coal mine is involved in this particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1780.216" offset="7273314">They purchase many other rights along with it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1784.703" offset="7291286">But many rights: the right to sink shafts, to erect buildings on the surface; a whole variety of other rights were purchased along with the coal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1799.130" offset="7348964">And finally, the companies do not contest the fact that since this program was initiated back in 1966, that they have operated their mines, they have operated them at a profit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2160.938" offset="8796252">I read their reply brief, and I don't really the support estate talked about very much at all; they're concentrating on the coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.058" offset="8816732">So I think it's a little bit of both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.558" offset="8822688">But our argument really doesn't change based upon the focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.211" offset="8841287">Because the focus is, in a case like this, on the overall economic impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.699" offset="8863335">This is not a case that falls into one of the areas where the Court has seen fit to adopt a per se rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.471" offset="8898339">This is not a case like a physical appropriate case, or a physical invasion case, where in almost every instance, regulation will be found to be a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.411" offset="8938150">In the absence of invasion or appropriation, the Court's approach has been less structured and, frankly, more lenient towards regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.433" offset="8974199">And there are good reasons for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.885" offset="8984021">The police power on which regulatory actions like this one is based... are based... is an essential component of an organized society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.907" offset="9024145">And this power, as this Court has recognized time and again, can't be overly restrained without doing damage to the State's and the government's ability to protect the citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.965" offset="9064373">In theory, of course, compensation could be paid every time regulation diminished property values at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.452" offset="9094257">But the Court has recognized in many cases that this is an unworkable solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.356" offset="9113901">And frankly, property and all property values are not entirely sacrosanct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.094" offset="9132919">To a degree, they may be limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.027" offset="9140651">They may be regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.046" offset="9144726">Sometimes in return for... really, for nothing more than the owner's right to live and do business in an organized society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.715" offset="9175341">Police power regulation of this sort is especially important in the area of land use, which is what we are dealing with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.988" offset="9208465">The zoning cases have recognized through the years that land use is interdependent; that my use of my land has spillover effects beyond the borders of my property, in fact, beyond the borders of my neighbor's property as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.398" offset="9266039">In order to deal with this competition between, on the one hand, the right of property owners to use and enjoy their property, and on the other hand, the government's need to regulate the use and enjoyment of property in the spillover effects, to deal with this competition the Court has adopted the practice of looking broadly at what an owner has, and assessing against that baseline the overall effect of regulation on the owner's economic interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.084" offset="9384843">And this has been an evolutionary process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.786" offset="9395606">Pennsylvania Coal was the first step.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.154" offset="9405114">In that case, the Court made the general statement that regulation, if it goes too far, can amount to a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.308" offset="9429774">This was carried forward in the later cases, particularly Goldblatt, Penn Central, and Hodel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.462" offset="9458300">And what these later cases make abundantly clear is that the effect of regulation must be judged against the entire package of rights which the owner controls; not by isolating a particular segment which may be most clearly affected by the regulation, and just looking at the effect on that segment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.559" offset="9538757">To do otherwise, quite simply, is unrealistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.844" offset="9551818">Property is not purchased, it is not valued or viewed in legally discrete components.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.415" offset="9578150">It is purchased and acquired and viewed in legally recognized bundles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.302" offset="9593719">So in this case we have coal companies who operate coal mines.</text>

            <text syncTime="3203.108" offset="12964873">There... Pennsylvania Coal, quite frankly, if it ever... if it ever did, no longer stands for the proposition that an owner has a Constitutionally protected right in the full use of every segment of his property.</text>

            <text syncTime="3252.375" offset="13161941">Yet the curtailment of maximum profit opportunities never has been viewed by the Court, nor should it, as standing alone, a basis on which to rest a takings claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="3295.802" offset="13335707">But in a case such as this, what they would like the Court to do is draw the lines at the boundaries of this protected building; take a look at the coal under there; and just assess the effect on that segment of their property.</text>
