            <text syncTime="14.174" offset="205687">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.776" offset="216136">On behalf of the town of Newton, New Hampshire, I appear before you today because a gentleman by the name of Bernard Rumery reached an agreement in conjunction with the dismissal of a valid criminal prosecution against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.637" offset="279562">Mr. Rumery agreed that he would not pursue a civil action against the town, the arresting officer, or any of the town's public servants.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.243" offset="321985">Subsequently, Mr. Rumery breached that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.195" offset="337763">The Federal District Court, Justice Martin Laughlin, ruled that Mr. Rumery's agreement should be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.217" offset="369841">The Court specifically found that Mr. Rumery voluntarily, knowingly and deliberately waived his right to bring a subsequent action and that when he did so, he did so thinking and knowing that it was in his best interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.428" offset="442670">Mr. Rumery now seeks to escape the consequences of his agreement by asking this Court to apply a per se prohibition against the type of agreement that he entered on that day in 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.772" offset="508081">If the Court accepts the arguments offered by Mr. Rumery and allows him to revoke his agreement, then this Court not only will be providing Mr. Rumery with a benefit but will also be denying all present and future defendants in a situation like Mr. Rumery, they will in effect be prevented from taking upon themselves an opportunity like that which was presented by Mr. Rumery.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.128" offset="645485">I therefore suggest to the Court that application of a per se rule in this case offends common sense, basic justice, and fair play.</text>

            <text syncTime="142.257" offset="718001">You could say the same thing about, if you... if we didn't enforce promises made to blackmailers we would be denying people in the future the opportunity to prevent blackmailers from doing the terrible things they are threatening to do by making a promise to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="182.365" offset="878497">The suggestion that a blackmailer in the town might be engaging in a similar type of conduct as regards this type of a situation, I would suggest, is not appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.457" offset="930847">This is a case where the County Attorney, as opposed to a town... an actual town representative... entered in to an agreement when he was concerned about a prosecution, concerned about the principal witness, the complaining witness, and the fact that she was also the victim of a rape and that she may not be willing to testify in this subsequent action, he entered into an agreement at that point in time to dismiss the prosecution, conditioned upon the police officer, the public servants, and the town being somewhat protected, or being protected against a civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.801" offset="1100225">This is a case where a man made a voluntary, knowing and deliberate choice.</text>
