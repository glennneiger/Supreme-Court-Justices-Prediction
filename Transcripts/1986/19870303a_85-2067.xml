            <text syncTime="1445.143" offset="5913367">We showed in our reply brief that there was no such body of case law, but even if there were, deleting the language on which collateral attack would be based seems a most peculiar way to signal any intention to carry forward such a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.761" offset="5983898">The contrary conclusion, that Congress wanted to make clear that collateral attacks were not allowed, seems to me to be a much more reasonable reading of Congress's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.101" offset="6029246">The dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals and the Second Circuit in its opinion in Potrella noted that Section 1105(a) makes it especially clear that collateral attack is not authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.141" offset="6093403">None of the Courts of Appeals that have allowed collateral attack have considered this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.342" offset="6114196">It was not clear under the 1952 Act whether deportations order could be appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.746" offset="6143871">This Court held in 1955 that review was provided in the Courts of Appeals under the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.727" offset="6179711">The lower courts approved other avenues for judicial review as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.663" offset="6199460">Congress responded in 1961 by enacting Section 1105(a), which provides that appeal from the Board of Immigration Appeals to the Courts of Appeals is the "sole and exclusive procedure" for obtaining judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.281" offset="6265916">That is an extraordinarily clear statement of Congress's intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.747" offset="6283783">And it ought to be given force here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.997" offset="6292874">Furthermore, Congress provided two exceptions to its rule that appeal from the board to the Courts of Appeals is the sole and exclusive procedure, and one of those exceptions, Section 1105(a)(A)(6), which provides for pretrial review and criminal prosecutions for failure to depart from the United States following an order of deportation makes it clear that Congress was thinking about collateral attack in criminal prosecutions when it enacted Section 1105(a) and that it recognized that absent an exception Section 1105(a) would bar collateral attack on deportation proceedings in criminal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.761" offset="6455878">But Congress made no exception for prosecutions under Section 1326.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.336" offset="6486180">Therefore we think there is no such exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.303" offset="6502063">I would like to note briefly that we don't think that there is any reason to construe Section 1326 contrary to its plain language and the language of Section 1105(a) to avoid a serious constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.375" offset="6570294">We think that those concerns were put to rest in Lewis, where the Court said that Congress could constitutionally focus on the fact of a prior proceeding and not its validity in denying a right to collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.102" offset="6637272">This case is not meaningfully different from Lewis because the prior proceeding was administrative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.131" offset="6665380">Collateral attack is only useful when the prior proceeding is flawed in some way, and a flawed judicial proceeding is no better than a flawed administrative proceeding, we don't think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.220" offset="6709684">In short, the respondents were deported and pulled when they were... first they were given the right to appeal and they waived that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.792" offset="6776035">They were then given a form at the border telling them that they couldn't reenter the United States without obtaining the attorney general's permission, and that they would be subject to a felony prosecution if they did return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.037" offset="6824936">We don't think that there is anything unfair about denying them the... about saying that they waived the right to appeal by waiving.</text>

            <text syncTime="1687.235" offset="6881778">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, I am here to argue that a deportation order which has not been previously reviewed in a judicial forum in any way can be looked at by a court before it becomes the predicate for a criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.410" offset="7006435">Such a review is permitted by the legislative history of Section 1326, the reentry after deportation statute, and it is also commensurate with the overall purpose of the Immigration and Nationalization Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.905" offset="7064427">It is important to allow some procedure or format for such a review to determine whether the prior adjudication was after a full and adequate hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.480" offset="7106745">It is important to ensure that no gross miscarriage of justice occurred in that administrative hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.318" offset="7130151">And the only way to ensure that is to allow some examination of whether the applicable constitutional, statutory, and regulatory procedures were followed by the administrative judge.</text>
