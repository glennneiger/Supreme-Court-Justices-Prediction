            <label>Mr. Michael F. Close</label>
            <text syncTime="171.465" offset="829931">Well, the problem with that... the answer to that is not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.791" offset="851246">The dispute begins in April of 1977 when the respondent's car blew up on an interstate highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.426" offset="901820">"Blew up" is their phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.112" offset="908611">It was taken under tow to Bano Buick, which is the co-petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.064" offset="928360">And although the parties disagree on what, they do agree that the car needed a totally new engine.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.624" offset="958557">Now, the Conways' version of the facts... and we have to accept that for purpose of today's argument... is that they would go out and look in the local junkyards for a replacement engine, and that Bano Buick was not supposed to do anything until the Conways had found the engine that they wanted put back into the 1973 Opel, which was the faulty car.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.222" offset="1056987">Now, Mr. Conway, Jeff Conway, went out and found engines, looked... scoured the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.500" offset="1086140">And apparently, when he found the engine that he said should be put into the car, he called up Bano Buick and said, hey, I've got the engine.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.029" offset="1120203">Well, Bano Buick then said, oh, glad you called.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.355" offset="1133578">We're just about to start your car.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.230" offset="1140997">And we'd like you to come down and pick it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.337" offset="1157506">Apparently, he says, what are you talking about?</text>
            <text syncTime="256.257" offset="1169104">I haven't authorized it.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.632" offset="1174642">Well, anyway, he and Mrs. Conway come down.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.273" offset="1185196">They get to the... they get to the car dealership, and they see in the car what they say... and we have to accept this as true also for purposes of today... they saw a junk engine that he had seen in another Croton Falls junkyard, and he had turned that engine down because he didn't think it was a good enough engine to put in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.373" offset="1269624">So whatever argument they had, their version of the dispute is that... which they swear to... is that they were bullied and intimidated by Bano Buick.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.977" offset="1324063">Bano Buick was going to... if they wanted to put in a different engine, was going to charge them more money, and whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.256" offset="1349140">Their phrase is that, in fear they wrote out the check for the amount and initiated their escape and left.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.378" offset="1385607">The next day the usual practice of Bano is to deposit their checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.687" offset="1414864">They deposited the disputed check, which is No. 154.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.497" offset="1430120">It's dated the 10th of May, 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.778" offset="1439211">Bano deposits the check.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.434" offset="1445898">It comes back: Insufficient funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.494" offset="1458123">They say they hold the check a couple of days, and they call in to see if there's sufficient funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.007" offset="1496157">They redeposit the check.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.288" offset="1501277">This time it comes back: stop payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.522" offset="1510159">Now, at this point the parties disagree as to who exactly said what.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.659" offset="1526773">The Banos claim they made a reasonable offer to settle with the Conways, to say, we'll give you credit for the old engine, but we'll charge you for the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.593" offset="1562508">The Conways dispute that.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.328" offset="1569405">Whatever it was, they couldn't reach a settlement then of this dispute, as to whether the check would be honored, or what Banos would do on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.119" offset="1608588">And with negotiations at an apparent impasse, apparently the Banos went to my client, who is the village justice and also a local lawyer, and they brought the check to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.395" offset="1669715">And such advice which is third-hand in the record, as he said to us, look, the first... the bounced check is a criminal whatever, and the subsequent stop payment has got nothing to do with it, because it's after the check.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.297" offset="1725304">I would have thought that advice was correct under State law at the time that he gave it anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="2828.884" offset="11459677">Because there would be no indication as to how long it had been before the case would have been dismissed until that... September 20th, 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.381" offset="11493637">The interference with the malicious prosecution cause of action, that occurred on September 20th, 1979, at the end of the period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.218" offset="11549016">It was the arrest that occurred at the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.702" offset="11558943">The petitioners make the argument that the substantive due process is not properly before this Court, and it was never considered by the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.271" offset="11657163">It fact, it had been considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.458" offset="11669911">The Second Circuit did not feel that it had to rely upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.971" offset="11684017">Now, I suspect there may have been some... that Judge Oakes' treatment of the case was that he felt that seven hours of detention was sufficiently enough to remand the case for trial that he need not go exploring for other Constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.214" offset="11744935">But as long as there is one Constitutional right, we submit that this case has to go to trial in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.615" offset="11802613">The petitioners have tried to make an argument that there is a cutoff point at the moment of arraignment under New York law between the false arrest claim, which ceases from the moment of arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.589" offset="11914417">From this they seek to infer that there is the beginning of a malicious prosecution cause of action that starts at the moment of arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.991" offset="11948063">That is squarely belied under New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.693" offset="11962900">Sheldon v. Carpenter, for example... and I quote from 4 New York 580... states that in an action for malicious prosecution, the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages, not only for his unlawful arrest and imprisonment and for the expense of his defense, but for the injury to his name and character by reason of the false accusation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.231" offset="12049000">Now, this is at least a clear indication of New York's intent on the malicious prosecution cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.305" offset="12097379">We submit that this Court is clearly not bound by New York State law in formulating the causes of action under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.083" offset="12136458">But 1983 should form a model.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.036" offset="12144295">It should indicate the conduct that is wrongful, for example, the conduct of conspiring, as it were, to do a number on Lynn Conway, to get money from her, to make her pay on a check for work that was not done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.671" offset="12202809">Here, Lynn Conway suffered from the petitioner's abuses of the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.182" offset="12240843">They conspired to violate her Federal rights in a scheme to extort money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.790" offset="12259233">They had her arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.195" offset="12268846">She was handcuffed, forced into the police car, hauled to the village court of Mt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.692" offset="12298835">Kisco some 45 minutes away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.129" offset="12304582">She was held under confinement for seven hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.893" offset="12323704">She was arraigned at 1:30 in the morning, and released on her own recognizance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.438" offset="12341885">Then she was hauled before Justice Cerbone's courtroom, where, under the Mt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.561" offset="12366335">Kisco quaint custom, the Martabanos, who were the complaining witnesses, also handled the private criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.667" offset="12398832">Nor surprisingly, the Martabanos, who were Justice Cerbone's cousins and clients, managed to prevail, under the Assistant District Attorney stepped in and said that they would not go forward with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.081" offset="12472393">And that point, Justice Cerbone screamed out through the courtroom, you will continue to try this case... or prosecute this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.563" offset="12506352">You will try it, and you will get a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.343" offset="12513457">Lynn Conway was stripped of her right to a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.702" offset="12534877">Two years and 82 days elapsed from the date of her arrest, until the date that she was finally released.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.384" offset="12573643">Her cause of action for malicious prosecution had been stripped.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.008" offset="12592138">In short, the respondent submits that the petitioners, Alfred Martabano, Alfred v. Martabano, Bano Buick, and Vincent Cerbone, engaged in a classic violation of Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.125" offset="12656608">They conspired to deprive Lynn Conway of rights, privileges, and immunities secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.248" offset="12689104">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael F. Close</label>
            <text syncTime="3143.776" offset="12719197">Answering Mr. Justice Scalia's question, there is no tort of conspiracy recognized by New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.757" offset="12759113">They contend that Mrs. Conway had sufficient funds, and that if the check... if he had rushed down to deposit the check, it would have cleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.627" offset="12806655">The record doesn't sustain that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.252" offset="12817104">She had already drawn against the funds that the account shows as of 5/10/77.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.483" offset="12842077">So it would be true that the check would clear only if the check No. 154, which is at stake, was presented under the bank's rules, before 153, 152.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.448" offset="12897875">As soon as any of the earlier written checks had cleared, she would be insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.384" offset="12913653">That, under the New York statute, is insufficient funds when she wrote it, because the statute requires that you have sufficient funds that you haven't already drawn upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.334" offset="12953464">As far as the other theories of liability... Sixth Amendment and docket notation... they're just not properly here, because they would lead to a very different judgment than the judgment we are appealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.530" offset="13014277">The holding below is that whatever is common law, malicious prosecution, under New York law, is necessarily a 1983 case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3235.180" offset="13084807">So that's all that's at stake, is whether there's enough here to go to trial.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael F. Close</label>
            <text syncTime="3239.366" offset="13101526">Yes, but the rationale of the decision below, in response to my argument that Paul v. Davis, Baker v. McCollan, and Gerstein v. Pugh, which said malicious prosecution is not a claim under 1983, the court below said, no, look, this is New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.376" offset="13165578">It's valid under New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.829" offset="13171429">His theory of Sixth Amendment would lead to a very different kind of judgment, and so would his docket notation theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.999" offset="13204135">So they're not arguments that would sustain the ruling below, and therefore, I don't think that they're properly presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.308" offset="13237362">And for the reasons we state in our brief, we don't think substantive due process has anything to do with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.492" offset="13258051">We don't think that Mrs. Conway has anything in common with Mrs. Roe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.694" offset="13274874">You know, she's just not within... she's not within the realm of privacy interests, which are protected by that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.784" offset="13303295">And she is invoking the doctrine because she wants an additional Federal remedy to what's already adequate under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.142" offset="13332657">She's not like Mrs. Roe who comes here because she has no remedy under State law at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.624" offset="13354600">So Mrs. Conway's complaint can't be considered under the substantive process doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.747" offset="13375080">Unless the Court has any other questions about the record, the petitioner will rest.</text>
