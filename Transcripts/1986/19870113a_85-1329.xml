            <text syncTime="21.344" offset="240595">The issue in this case is whether a person charged with a serious criminal contempt has a right to be investigated and prosecuted by a disinterested prosecutor; more specifically, a prosecutor who is not concurrently representing the interests of the United States and the interests of a private party.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.624" offset="317709">In 1978 Vuitton sued the claimants, who are among the petitioners here, for trademark infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.480" offset="353131">In July of 1970... excuse me, in July of 1982, that matter was settled with a promise on the part of the defendants in the action to pay $100,000, and the issuance of an injunction which was designed to protect Vuitton's trademark rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.608" offset="425647">That injunction prohibited, among other things, the manufacture or sale, offering to sell, and aiding and abetting such an offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.814" offset="466398">The issue... the injunction was issued in July of 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.032" offset="487296">And in December of 1982, Sol Klayminc sued Mr. Bainton, Joseph Bainton, who was the lawyer for Vuitton in the underlying trademark infringement injunction, for defamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.042" offset="547377">The source of the alleged defamation was an article which was published in the Wall Street Journal in December of 1982, and at the same time that the suit began, or approximately the same time, payment on the $100,000 settlement was stopped.</text>

            <text syncTime="132.199" offset="683945">The sting covered a wide number of topics, and by the end of March, Mr. Bainton felt, apparently, that he had sufficient information to apply to the court to be appointed as special prosecutor pursuant to Rule 42(b), as well as applied to the court for some extraordinary authority to conduct the sting.</text>

            <text syncTime="725.844" offset="3058580">Speaking of the U.S. Attorney, Judge Brieant, who I think was initially sensitive to the possibility that some problems would exist, and also to the alleged magnitude of the case, as it was explained to him, directed Mr. Brieant... Mr. Brieant; Mr. Bainton, on April 6th to... which is about five days into the... into the taped portion of the sting, and about five days after he was appointed special prosecutor... to, quote, fully debrief the United States Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.296" offset="3184386">Well, he... he... I think, Your Honor, and I have to go back to the transcript to be sure, he directed Mr. Bainton to fully debrief the U.S. Attorney, and said that he wasn't requiring the United States Attorney to come in; that it was simply a suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.575" offset="3253454">In any event, I don't think it's important to quarrel over whether he was directed or whether it was suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.978" offset="3275083">The full debriefing never occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.346" offset="3284592">Mr. Bainton sent a short, two paragraph letter, which is in the appendix, to Mr. Pedowitz, who was at that point, was chief of the criminal division.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.202" offset="3315939">And apparently never receiving a reply, contacted him sometime later, and the reply was apparently "good luck".</text>
            <text syncTime="799.392" offset="3352719">The U.S. Attorney was never fully offered this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.444" offset="3368915">The matter was never referred to the United States Attorney by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.812" offset="3386469">In short, the procedure suggested by the government, that is, the Solicitor General's Office, in their brief, were never complied with in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.187" offset="3427952">The tapes and the conversations that occurred during the investigation covered a wide variety of topics.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.494" offset="3477167">They first discussed the defamation action.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.279" offset="3492318">And there was an apparent attempt on the tapes by Mr. Weinberg to elicit an admission from Sol Klayminc that in fact the defamation action was frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.052" offset="3527426">There was an attempt to discover the financial assets of Sol Klayminc.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.824" offset="3558460">It also discussed, in fact... discussed mostly plans to manufacture counterfeit bags in Haiti.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.145" offset="3587717">Also discussed in the tapes, or stated on the tapes, were suggestions by Weinberg in response to inquiries from one or more of the defendants in this case that in fact the proposed plan to manufacture bags in Haiti and distribute them elsewhere was not illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.789" offset="3662323">And I just would wish to emphasize that those kinds of lulling statements occur, not in the context of a heroin conspiracy or a cocaine conspiracy, something that it is beyond any doubt at all is wrong, and you don't need to be told that it is not, this occurs in the context of an injunction which had very specific, proper business purposes, to protect Vuitton's trademark rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.840" offset="3762528">In that context, suggesting to someone, as Weinberg did time and time again, that the plan that they were discussing, and the scheme, if you will, that was afoot, would not violate the injunction is particularly offensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.016" offset="3819266">The interests that the special prosecutor labored under here were not only the duty to Vuitton.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.539" offset="3853330">In fact, there was another client, Fendi, who was also apparently a very expensive trademark, because Mr.... Mr. Bainton also represented Fendi.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.995" offset="3895126">And in fact, in discharging Mr. Rochman, who was originally a defendant in this case, from his civil obligations for Vuitton as attorney for Fendi, Mr. Bainton discharged Mr. Rochman as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.571" offset="3957506">And that's contained in a letter that is also in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.439" offset="3968896">There's the $100,000 judgment against Sol Klayminc and the family companies, including Barry Klayminc.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.962" offset="3998989">That was... as I say, payment was stopped on that with about $81,000 left to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.116" offset="4023648">There's a $750,000 judgment against petitioner Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.520" offset="4045278">Petitioner Young was involved in a case in California in 1981, in which he agreed to an injunction prohibiting him from manufacturing, selling, offering to sell, counterfeit Louis Vuitton bags.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.327" offset="4092507">As a part of that agreement, there was a liquidated damages provision of $750,000 that would only become due and owing if Young violated that injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.135" offset="4143707">In addition to that, there's a personal interest the special prosecutor had, because he was a defendant in a defamation action which was begun before the sting.</text>

            <text syncTime="1048.603" offset="4349552">The suit was for two a quarter million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.620" offset="4357702">Somebody hired a lawyer to represent him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1062.161" offset="4403782">What we're really talking about here is an appearance of a conflict of interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1270.623" offset="5237715">Thank you, Mr. Cohen.</text>

            <text syncTime="1273.925" offset="5250881">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.331" offset="5284527">I am representing one of the two parties which is calling itself the government in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.286" offset="5320367">For clarification, of course, Mr. Bainton is the special prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.440" offset="5344922">I'll refer to him as the special prosecutor, and I'll refer to the positions that the Department of Justice is arguing before the Court as the government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.314" offset="5384419">Now, the government's position in this case is a little different from the position taken by either of the other two parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.485" offset="5417124">Basically, it can be summarized in four propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.122" offset="5435619">First, that ordinarily it is the United States Attorney who should prosecute serious contempts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.610" offset="5461637">Second, that in some special cases... and we think that for practical reasons, this is going to be a very limited class... but in some special cases, it is appropriate for the court to appoint a private attorney to prosecute a criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.404" offset="5524749">Third, that that should be done, if at all, only after the United States Attorney has been given the case for consideration and has declined the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.129" offset="5571665">And fourth... excuse me... that the attorney for the opposing party in a civil case should never be the party who is appointed to prosecute a criminal... a serious criminal contempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="1376.725" offset="5662048">Well, I think there are two answers to that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.410" offset="5672811">First, Rule 42(b) does contain a reference... it's a very cryptic reference, to be sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.183" offset="5703949">But it is a reference to the notion that either the U.S. Attorney or an attorney appointed by the court can handle criminal contempts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.039" offset="5739371">It does not specify what that attorney is to do, other than to take part in the notice-taking process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1415.131" offset="5815648">Well, I don't think so, because my second answer is that I think criminal contempt is a different animal in some important respects from the typical criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.754" offset="5854205">And we believe that it is inherent, even if there were no Rule 42(b), it is inherent in the power of the courts to enforce their judgments that they are not wholly dependent on the executive branch to enforce those judgments.</text>

            <text syncTime="1556.619" offset="6381669">I think there is some force to the argument that the appointments clause does not get in the way of... show a constitutional disposition against... this kind of appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.010" offset="6435168">Because if Congress had, for example, more specifically designated the special prosecutor as being someone who could be appointed, then we would be beyond appointments clause problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.102" offset="6491593">So... excuse me... it's not a constitutional problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.488" offset="6509147">At most, it's a question of the degree of the specificity of the authorizing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.375" offset="6524716">But beyond that, I think it's important to point out some of the practical problems that this kind of conflict of interest creates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.981" offset="6559093">We point out in the brief that the statutes and regulations which Congress has imposed on regular Department of Justice employees establish a Federal policy against just this kind of conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.459" offset="6641013">We think it's a general policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.577" offset="6649477">We think it's a policy that this Court ought to apply to this kind of conflicting representation where the United States and a private party are both being represented by the same attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.869" offset="6694616">Section 208(a) was pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.904" offset="6710812">Section 528 of Title XXVIII states that conflicts of interest will not be permitted in cases in which the United States... an Assistant United States Attorney is carrying forward a prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.931" offset="6766923">And that statute directs the government to pass particular regulations dealing with conflicts of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.971" offset="6807047">And among those regulations is one that would apply directly in this case, Section 735-4, stating that if an organization has a substantial interest in the outcome of a case, and that organization is one with which the attorney is allied in the personal... in some personal sense, that the attorney is disqualified from proceeding with the prosecution or investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1720.891" offset="7038701">Now, there might be closer questions dealing with organizations such as the ABA, but clearly, in a case like this, that regulation would cover a prosecutor, and the prosecutor would be disqualified from proceeding with the investigation or prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.115" offset="7087603">Now, as a practical matter, there are special problems in this kind of case, one of which is, for example, mention was made of Mr. Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.153" offset="7127831">Mr. Young is one of the defendants who apparently had some assets, and he had a $750,000 judgment which was subject to execution if he were convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.211" offset="7179971">Well, that is an enormous incentive to choose Mr. Young as one of the defendants to prosecute, as opposed to, for example, using Mr. Young as a witness against some of the other defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.002" offset="7219155">Similarly, in current times, when there is a specific Federal statute prohibiting trademark infringement, the Section 402 of the contempt statutes comes into play, and that statute provides that a fine can either go to the... the victim or to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.367" offset="7320615">Obviously, the attorney for the victim is going to have an interest to see to it, to urge the court, to have the fine paid to the victim as opposed to the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1801.139" offset="7359694">Well, Mr. Bryson, what you say I don't doubt makes a good deal of sense in the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.608" offset="7377562">But if we adopt your position that people with a conflict of interest can't be appointed special prosecutors, that it first have to go to the United States Attorney, the court is left without any realistic way of enforcing an injunction or prosecuting a contemner, unless the U.S. Attorney approves.</text>

            <text syncTime="1825.504" offset="7457183">Well, Your Honor, I have a couple of answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.956" offset="7467005">First of all, I think almost invariably the United States Attorney will prosecute such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.074" offset="7487485">That's the policy of the Justice Department as set out in the section of the U.S. Attorney's manual that we have... we have quoted in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.780" offset="7522280">Second, there is a fallback in the availability of administrative office funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.620" offset="7549656">And third... and I think this is not an insignificant factor... there are law firms that are willing to offer services on a pro bono basis, which happens on a regular... regular... from time to time, in cases in which, for example, a mandamus action is brought against a judge, and none of the parties is prepared to defend the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.847" offset="7626561">The judge can be defended on a pro bono basis by a law firm that the judge selects.</text>

            <text syncTime="1911.526" offset="7801268">Most of the cases... the problem is, most of these cases have involved very small contempts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.716" offset="7834078">And the degree to which somebody is participating as a special prosecutor is on a very limited basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.720" offset="7858006">In McCann, it may not have gone much beyond simply the notice stage, which was authorized... was subsequently authorized by Rule 42(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.826" offset="7894473">But certainly McCann and some of the other cases of about that age that are cited in Mr. Bainton's brief would fall generally into that category.</text>

            <text syncTime="2020.827" offset="8238453">1911 is the oldest I have, which is Gompers, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.012" offset="8255171">The first appointment is In re Debs, which was decided by this Court in 1895.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.368" offset="8292683">The Rule 42(b) was enacted in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.736" offset="8310133">Now, in Professor Orfields... who was the reporter to the advisory committee on the Federal Rules treatise... he indicated that the advisory committee and therefore presumptively this Court, in enacting Rule 42(b), meant to codify prior existing practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.913" offset="8374812">And the prior existing practice was described in the Second Circuit's decision in McCann v. New York Stock Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.232" offset="8400099">In that case, the Second Circuit held that it was not only allowable, but the preferred practice, in cases such as this one, for the Court to specially appoint the attorney for the civil litigant aggrieved by the disobedience of the Federal court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.159" offset="8459763">Now Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure also comes into play to the extent that it says, in substance, any... that... excuse me, as it says in substance that all prior practice is not excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.288" offset="8528308">To the extent that the Court does not find adequate authority to do what it did within Rule 42(b), which is what the District Court found in both opinions and the Second Circuit, we suggest that the power question can be resolved ultimately by reference to the All Writs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.082" offset="8599465">So I don't think that there is a serious question as to whether the court has the power to do what it did in this and other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.419" offset="8624856">Of course, it can't exercise this power in a way that deprives a defendant of his due process rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.223" offset="8648053">And that is the question that is really presented by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.675" offset="8665921">What has... what this Court I think has to do is balance the interests of an independent judiciary against the risk that this process might somehow compromise the rights of a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.415" offset="8716807">In that balancing process, I think the most important factor for the Court to take into account is the very special role that the District Court judge plays in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.873" offset="8762678">As Mr. Bryson pointed out, the decision to prosecute, to continue the prosecution, is not reposed with the District... excuse me, with the civil litigant's lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.598" offset="8801549">The decision in this case, and Musidor and McCann and the others, confers no right on a civil litigant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.019" offset="8835299">As a result of the Second Circuit's opinion, no civil litigant can go to a District Court judge and say, I have a trademark, I have an injunction, and I have what I think is evidence of probable cause of a violation of that injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.463" offset="8897052">I want a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.446" offset="8904994">That decision rests completely within the discretion of the District Court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.700" offset="8922025">And that's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.184" offset="8927877">And I think that answers most, if not all, of the arguments raised both by the petitioners and the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.140" offset="8963717">There exists within our system of justice a series of systemic safeguards that we think adequately protect any possible compromise of the defendant's right to a fair trial; not a perfect trial, a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.435" offset="9028918">As this Court held in Marshall v. Jerrico, there is not a constitutional right to a completely unbiased prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.111" offset="9083671">In that case, the Court used the phrase, too remote and insubstantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.896" offset="9098718">And that's what I most respectfully suggest the complaint's about this practice are, too remote and insubstantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.050" offset="9123377">There has been no claim that anything that occurred in this case, or any other case to my knowledge, was improper, was different than the U.S. Attorney under different circumstances might have done.</text>

            <text syncTime="3547.992" offset="14347136">And finally, I'd like to emphasize that Justice Scalia's point about the investigation, the remarks about... the remarks by petitioners about the... about the impropriety of the investigation, I think, are the largest red herring in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.774" offset="14442221">Justice Scalia, I believe you're absolutely right when you say that this is what happens in investigations of trademark counterfeiting everyday of the week.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.463" offset="14473046">The only thing that Judge Lasker's order changed from what would occur on a garden variety case is, we have videotapes and audio tapes of what was said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.336" offset="14512543">We have, I most respectfully submit, the best evidence of what occurred on those occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.454" offset="14533023">And that can do nothing but to protect the legitimate interests of the defendants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.942" offset="14550995">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3606.029" offset="14579312">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.131" offset="14583700">I'll speak quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.514" offset="14589238">First of all, with all due respect, Justice Rehnquist, the system in this country at the time of the Constitution was a system of public prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.903" offset="14618809">Not only that, for the past 100, 150 years, the system in England has been a system of public prosecution at least as it would apply to this kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.859" offset="14658620">In England, the police, not the victim, hire the private attorney to manage... to prosecute the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.215" offset="14692056">Second of all, it is simply not true that Mr. Bainton went to the U.S. Attorney a few hours after the appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.852" offset="14714626">He was appointed on March 31st, and the tapes began to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.637" offset="14729673">And they ran from March 31st until April 6th.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.423" offset="14740853">That's when the letter went out to the United States Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.891" offset="14754750">Thirdly, if you examine the appendix at pages 103 to 106, you'll see letters in which the hats, as you said, Justice Marshall, kept changing between the special prosecutor hat and Vuitton's hat, in terms of making deals with Rochman, and then the lodging, which we filed with the clerk of the court, at pages L36 and L39, the same hat sort of switched... I should say; well, it doesn't matter... with respect to Mr. Pariseault, who was also bargained with, depending on whose interests were at stake at that particular time.</text>
