            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="13.417" offset="205900">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, one of the prominent features of our federal labor laws is that Congress has singled out two industries, the railroads and the airlines, for special treatment under their own statute, the Railway Labor Act, which differs both in its substance and also in the way it is administered from the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.799" offset="291477">Those differences are designed to make railway and airline work stoppages more difficult and therefore less likely, reflecting a Congressional judgment that these two industries are particularly strike sensitive, and that the public has much to lose if strikes should occur in those industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.478" offset="370158">Indeed, this Court has pointed out several times that the principal purpose of the Railway Labor Act described in Section 2 and Section 2 first is to minimize the likelihood of railway and airline strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.911" offset="423866">The Act has been largely successful in achieving that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.643" offset="438808">The question presented in this case is whether Congress nonetheless intended that these two industries would be the only ones powerless against secondary picketing which is the single device most likely to result in nationally paralyzing strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.466" offset="502129">The holding that we seek is a narrow one.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.402" offset="513832">It is simply that there are some circumstances in which federal courts can enjoin secondary picketing of railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.633" offset="546746">The Court need not decide... we are not asking the Court to decide whether all secondary picketing of railroads is enjoinable.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.035" offset="580392">Given the facts of this case, where the labor dispute is confined, in the Court of Appeals' words, to a tiny railroad in New England, where the picketing occurred in Los Angeles against a railroad that does not operate within 1,000 miles of New England, and where the purpose of the picketing was, again in the Court of Appeals' words, to shut down the nation's entire railroad system.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.948" offset="668059">Affirmance of the Court of Appeals judgment will require the Court to hold that under no circumstances, regardless of how remote the connection between the labor dispute and the pressure point, and regardless of how great the damage to the national interest, no court may ever enjoin the picketing of a neutral railroad employer who is a powerless victim in someone else's labor dispute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>

            <text syncTime="283.760" offset="1287265">In exercise any kind of injunctive remedy the Court always has to look to the particular circumstances to determine whether an injunction is proper or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.772" offset="1323314">All I am really saying is that the fact that the Railway Labor Act does not in its terms deal with secondary picketing does not mean that the Courts do not have their usual injunctive powers where there has been a violation of the Railway Labor Act, and it is to that issue that I now turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.593" offset="1394576">It really turns on the view that you take of what kind of statute this Railway Labor Act is.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.809" offset="1423520">The key to the Court of Appeals error in our view was its holding that the Railway Labor Act is not a statute establishing rules but is rather, in the Court of Appeals' words, a statute establishing goals and calling on the judiciary to create the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.787" offset="1487363">In other words, it is not a statute like the Sherman Act in which the general principles were set forth and then the courts would be, in anticipation the courts would be called on to develop the details.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.580" offset="1530517">That premise lies at the very heart of the Court of Appeals rationale and its holding, and it is just flat wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.138" offset="1564790">The principal draftsman of the Railway Labor Act was a union lawyer, Mr. Donald Richburg, who described for Congress the general purpose of the statute, and that description was set forth by this Court in a Chicago and Northwestern opinion, and because it does really go to the heart of the case, with the Court's indulgence I will read this brief statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.645" offset="1658831">We believe, and this law has been written upon the theory that there is more danger in attempting to write specific provisions and penalties into the law than there is in writing the general duties and obligations into the law and then letting the enforcement of those duties and obligations develop through the courts in the way in which the common law has developed in England and America.</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="402.885" offset="1763739">Mr. Lee, precisely what do we look at in the Railway Labor Act to find unlawful this secondary picketing?</text>
            <text syncTime="412.928" offset="1803967">Where do we look?</text>
            <text syncTime="414.256" offset="1809296">Where is it, and what is it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="415.661" offset="1814939">Section 2 first, and Section 2 first prescribes that the parties will do everything in their power to make and maintain agreements in such a way as to minimize the interruption of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.311" offset="1873453">Now, how much mileage can you get out of that language, and to what extent can we derive specific rules from the general provisions of... from those more general provisions of the Railway Labor Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="442.791" offset="1923399">Let me give you just briefly three instances in which this Court has done just exactly that, and we think that the inference that we are asking from the general policy, the most important of the Act's policies, which was to avoid interruption to interstate commerce, is not anything more radical than what this Court has done in those three cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="462.377" offset="2001766">You don't think that if Congress had intended to make secondary picketing unlawful at the time that it wrote the Railway Labor Act that it would have said it was?</text>

            <text syncTime="470.905" offset="2035830">No, it would not, for two reasons, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.748" offset="2047219">One is that it was universally assumed and the Court of Appeals agrees with us on this point, that in 1926, when the Railway Labor Act was adopted, secondary picketing was universally condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.897" offset="2095807">There is simply no reason to assume that in a statute such as this one, which sets out the general rules and then leaves it to the courts to fill in the details, to assume that Congress would have made any assumption other than that secondary picketing was unlawful at the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="500.689" offset="2155053">You say that loosely speaking the Railway Labor Act is like the Sherman Act in that it sets general goals and lets the courts work out the methods of reaching them rather than the detailed statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="515.277" offset="2213358">That is absolutely right, and that lies at the heart of the Court of Appeals error.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.697" offset="2231017">The three cases that I would like to point out in which the Court has done just exactly that can be very briefly summarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.037" offset="2264349">The first one is the Chicago River case, which in 1957 upheld an order enjoining the union, notwithstanding the Norris-LaGuardia Act, enjoining the union from striking over minor disputes which were then pending before the National Railroad Adjustment Board, which is the entity that resolves these minor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.857" offset="2355673">The Railway Labor Act does not expressly prohibit that kind of a strike any more than in this case it expressly prohibits secondary picketing, but the Court nevertheless upheld the injunction because the strike, the Court found, was inconsistent with the purposes and the structure of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="698.238" offset="2945205">It is on Section 152, but that in turn is influenced by what the state of the law was in &lt;nineteen twenty-six&gt; [= 1926] when the Railway Labor Act was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.077" offset="2996509">Now, turning to major disputes, just very briefly I would like to point out two cases that we think are relevant to this very point.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.980" offset="3028170">The first is the Florida East Coast case.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.605" offset="3034648">That one did not involve an injunction, but it did squarely hold that even after the formal statutory processes for resolving major disputes have been exhausted, that the RLA still imposes limits on the parties' rights of self-help after that point in time, which is squarely inconsistent with what the Court of Appeals held, and it holds that those are to be found not in the RLA's express terms, because there are no express terms dealing with that, but rather from its purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.561" offset="3162439">And finally, in the Chicago and Northwest case, the one from which Mr. Richburg's quote is taken, the Court in 1971 held that the courts can enjoin a strike instituted after the major dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted where the conduct of the union... in that case it was a refusal to bargain in good faith... violated the purposes of the very section we are relying on, Section 2 first, which requires the parties to make every reasonable effort to avoid interruptions to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.375" offset="3285737">Now, in all three cases strikes over minor disputes in Chicago River, determination of the limits on the parties self-help rights following exhaustion of the major dispute resolution procedures in Florida East Coast, and the refusal to bargain after exhaustion of those same procedures in Chicago and Northwestern, the relevant RLA principles were found not in the terms of the Act but in its purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="867.310" offset="3621463">They were dealing only... you were dealing only with the issue of whether state law could apply, and the second is, if you look to what the Court said with respect to the Railway Labor Act, and it appears on Page 390, I submit that Jacksonville Terminal not only is not inconsistent with Chicago River, Chicago and Northwestern, and Florida East Coast, but indeed that it actually supports our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.548" offset="3738387">And I am reading from Page 390, and the relevant language is this.</text>

            <text syncTime="928.926" offset="3867954">It cannot categorically be said, the Court said, that the RLA prohibits all secondary picketing, but that is not the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.438" offset="3902018">If the case is strong enough, and it certainly is in this case, then the courts ought to be able to prohibit secondary picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.186" offset="3928976">The issue here is whether under the RLA any secondary picketing is unlawful, and the narrow holding, the only one that we seek, is that our national labor laws, the Railway Labor Act accommodated with Norris-LaGuardia and influenced by the National Labor Relations Act, permits some protection against secondary picketing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1255.762" offset="5175330">It was the holding very early in the game in Brotherhood of Engineers versus Baltimore and Ohio, in which the Court held that on the union side, though the Railway Labor Act does not explicitly guarantee the right to strike against the primary employer following exhaustion of the negotiation and mediation requirements, there is inferred a right to strike from the Act's failure to provide compulsory arbitration with respect to major disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.969" offset="5296121">What we are asking for, we think, necessarily follows from this Court's holding that the union can resort to some kinds of self-help following exhaustion of the major dispute resolution procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.321" offset="5353486">The Second Circuit held just last summer, frankly, I think, probably correctly, that those procedures are not available to employers other than the primary employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.490" offset="5394237">It follows, we submit, that the right of self-help against those other employers is also unavailable because it is nothing short of preposterous to assume that Congress would have so carefully prescribed protracted procedures which must be exhausted vis-a-vis the primary employer before resort to self-help against that employer is permitted and then would have permitted unlimited self-help which at any level against any employer must itself be inferred against carriers who are not even parties to the dispute, employers who the Second Circuit has held cannot invoke the negotiation and mediation strike-delaying proceedings and are therefore left without those core protections.</text>

            <text syncTime="1413.933" offset="5808016">And since that is tantamount to shut down the nation itself, there is simply no reason to assume that Congress intended to have railroad unions to have that long a lever, longer than is available to any other union in the country.</text>

            <text syncTime="1436.751" offset="5899236">What it anticipated is that those would be resolved by negotiation, by agreement, and not by self-help, but if unions such as this one know that once they have exhausted the statutory procedures vis-a-vis the primary employer, and they are then free to employ a weapon many times more powerful than a primary strike, a weapon capable of bringing the entire nation to its knees, because the statutory prerequisites to a strike, so carefully prescribed by Congress vis-a-vis the primary employer, are totally unavailable to the Union's new victims once it resorts to a nationwide rail stoppage, then the entire... the most important purpose of the Railway Labor Act will have been completely perverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.466" offset="6090139">It is small wonder that in the 60 years that we have had the Railway Labor Act, that this is the first instance in which any court has ever upheld, that is, the cases that came down this last summer, any court has ever upheld such picketing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1506.753" offset="6179268">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the petitioners in this case center on the 1926 Railway Labor Act as being the focal Act on which to examine to determine whether or not the unions do have a right to ask other railroad employees to help them in their dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.589" offset="6262651">Now, the unions submit that the appropriate Act to look at and to examine is the Norris-LaGuardia Act, the 1932 Act, and before we get into that, it would be helpful, we submit, to go back to the facts in this case to see exactly what is at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.394" offset="6329838">This is not the typical or the secondary boycott type of concept that was in existence around the turn of the century.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.547" offset="6370485">What is involved here is a union going to other railroad employees and asking those employees to help them in their struggle by withholding their labor because the union believes that by withholding their labor they will put sufficient pressure on the primary employer to have that primary employer negotiate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1580.099" offset="6472676">Around the turn of the century this was looked at as being a sympathy strike, but it also had the elements of what was called at that time a secondary boycott, putting pressure upon a neutral employer to require that employer to stop doing business with the primary employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.748" offset="6547281">There is a distinction in labor law between sympathy strikes and secondary boycotts which is often overshadowed or mixed together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.292" offset="6585420">But going to this particular case, what we are dealing with, as we indicated, is simply the request by a union to other employees to withhold their labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.007" offset="6624290">It involves two aspects that are essentially fundamental to all individuals, the right of free speech and a right to withhold one's labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.767" offset="6663265">Now, in 1932 Congress enacted the Norris-LaGuardia Act, which specifically informed the courts of two particular things that are relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.201" offset="6705061">First, they told the courts, we don't want you involved in labor disputes in determining what is proper and what is not proper conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1649.368" offset="6749678">That is our function, so you stay out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.100" offset="6760650">Secondly, Congress said, we are going to tell you what is proper conduct, and in Section 4 of the Act they specifically enumerated several types of conduct which they said, from now on, as we said in 1914 but no one would listen, and we say again, those types of conducts are conduct that cannot be enjoined.</text>

            <text syncTime="1852.160" offset="7560937">--Secondary picketing of railroads is... there is a lot of historical development that has occurred in the past 60 years that the Railway Labor Act has been in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.985" offset="7608166">When you go back to the actual reports of the National Mediation Board, what is shown is that between 1926, when the Act was enacted, and World War II, there were very few strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.246" offset="7657277">There were approximately three strikes during that time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.651" offset="7670860">And from... during World War Two up until shortly after that, around 1946, the unions still tried to restrain from striking, but there were a few cases where they were going to engage in strikes, and Congress or the President first tried to draft the people, and then Congress was considering enacting legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.705" offset="7755079">So the need for the full development or the need for the full use of the economic power of the unions did not occur during this time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.435" offset="7801995">But what also occurred during this time period was the multiple bargaining type, what is called national handling in the rail industry, that the unions negotiated nationally with all of the railroads and groups for wages and other factors that occurred during the thirties, so when the strike occurred it was a strike against everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.878" offset="7891752">Now, to say that because in the past there hasn't been this secondary picketing means that there is no such right of secondary picketing is an attempt to use the gloss of today's experience to interpret what was in existence back at that time period, which just can't be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.027" offset="7964372">And the first... when you finally got to the breaking of the national handling, individual strikes around the Florida East Coast time, secondary picketing was used, but the courts at that point stepped right into the fracas and enjoined it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.083" offset="8024558">Now fortunately, the Fifth Circuit in the 1966 Florida... or Atlantic Coastline case set aside the injunction, but the state courts entered the void that the federal courts had left and enjoined the secondary activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.376" offset="8077744">The next real strike where this occurred was the 1978 strike, and again, it was the courts that entered and eventually after about two months they broke the injunctions loose, but for two months the unions were enjoined from engaging in their full economic power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.932" offset="8140019">Then the next strike was the one we are dealing with now.</text>

            <text syncTime="2016.814" offset="8219536">It also prohibited the employees of those carriers for withholding their labor, so the injunction prohibited two forms, the speech, namely, placing the pickets, and secondly, the withholding of labor, prohibited the withholding of labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.088" offset="8288604">That is what was enjoined in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.212" offset="8297068">The union in a sense called for a sympathy strike, and the courts said we could not, and that was the injunction that was in place for approximately 40 days, with various injunctions, and in the meantime the Act which was set up by agreement of the parties back in 1926, and this is why we say the 1926 Act cannot have this effect of outlawing secondary picketing, that the petitioners say, is because it was an agreement between the union and the management.</text>

            <text syncTime="2576.276" offset="10457394">We submit, Your Honor, there are no standards in either the Railway Labor Act nor the Norris-LaGuardia Act that would in any way justify the adoption of a substantial alignment doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.364" offset="10501698">The Act specifically says that the courts are to be out of interpreting what is and what is not permissible conduct, and unless there are standards by Congress that the Courts are authorized to interpret, as this Court said in the Jacksonville Terminal case, the courts should not enter this particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.028" offset="10584349">Now, this brings us... the question in this case, and this is why we are not... although we defend and we submit the court is correct, the Court of Appeals was correct, that the Norris-LaGuardia Act would control even if there was an implicit ban against secondary picketing in the Railway Labor Act, we submit when you go back to the history and to the facts, the development of the Railway Labor Act, that is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.017" offset="10700333">And as this Court held in the Jacksonville Terminal case, there is nothing in the Railway Labor Act which outlaws secondary picketing, secondary activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.198" offset="10752996">The courts in that case, and that was, we submit, the more difficult case than is facing this Court today, because the Norris-LaGuardia Act did not apply to states, the court had to look in the Jacksonville Terminal case at the body of law, the federal law that existed as to what was and what was not permissible self-help.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.595" offset="10842648">And it looked to the body of law that developed into the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.016" offset="10860307">Now, in the National Labor Relations Act in 1947 Congress decided that secondary activities should be prohibited but when it did that it specifically limited the banning of secondary activities to industries that were covered by the National Labor Relations Act, and did not extend it to the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.116" offset="10948705">In 1959 Congress extended to the railroads the protection against secondary picketing by nonrailroad unions but again did not extend the ban against secondary picketing, secondary activity to the railroads, so what this court faced in the Jacksonville Terminal case was a body of law, body of labor law that did say that some forms of secondary picketing were improper but some forms of secondary conduct were proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.337" offset="11089557">And the court then faced the question, how do we determine which are proper and which are not proper, and it indicated that was one of the most complex areas of labor law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3508.524" offset="14186321">Now, if you hold that the Norris-LaGuardia Act prohibits enjoining a violation of the Railway Labor Act, then you have got some cases to overrule, and there is just no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.189" offset="14245045">Now, my friend, Mr. Clarke, said that as to the Chicago and Northwestern case that there there was a violation of a specific provision which he said was the heart of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3538.043" offset="14304395">The heart of the Act that the Court said was violated in that instance was exactly the same provision that we are relying on here, Section 2 first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.258" offset="14345250">The specific guarantee, the specific violation was not written into the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.584" offset="14366566">It was an obligation to bargain in good faith, and that had to be inferred, that had to be inferred from the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3619.870" offset="14631761">I mean, it seems to me your reasoning leads to the conclusion that because the statute was designed to prevent strikes, and once you exhaust the procedures and they don't work, the only way to achieve the object of the Act is to enjoin a strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="3635.238" offset="14693201">--No, it doesn't say... it does not say that there will be no strikes, and this Court has held that at a certain point in time there can be strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.406" offset="14729877">We are not taking the position that there can't be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.484" offset="14738132">We are just saying that its principal purpose was to avoid that if at all possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.685" offset="14759030">Now, what this Court clearly has held in a case that really isn't given the play that it ought to have been is this Florida East Coast case, which also says that even when you come to the exhaustion of those procedures vis-a-vis the primary employer it is still not law of the jungle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.334" offset="14833531">You still have to look to see whether in light of the overall purposes of the Act what the rule should be with respect to the parties' rights at self-help after that point in time.</text>
