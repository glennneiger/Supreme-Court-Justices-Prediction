            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="137648">We will hear argument now in No. 85-1347, Pennsylvania against George F. Ritchie.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.670" offset="168264">Mr. Clark, you may begin whenever you are ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="edward_marcus_clark" startTime="10.003" stopTime="308.898">
            <label>Mr. Edward Marcus Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="10.003" offset="177563">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is before you today on a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.959" offset="209432">The Commonwealth has contended in our brief that the Intermediate appellate court and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania erroneously construed and misapplied two very important segments of the Sixth Amendment jurisprudence of this Court, and in the process effectively have dismantled a very elaborate statutory procedure erected to encourage more complete reporting of what has become a very shameful and often secret crime, the sexual abuse of children.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.330" offset="338895">Specifically, the court below erred, we contend, in concluding that the compulsory process and the confrontation clause invariably requires that a criminal defendant in a sexual offense case such as this must be given pretrial access to confidential records compiled by a child protective service agency notwithstanding the fact that the records were never used or employed by the prosecution at any stage of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.516" offset="459686">Before we address the merits of those contentions, Your Honors, I would request the Court's indulgence in view of the fact that the respondent here has interposed a challenge to this Court's jurisdiction under the so-called final judgment rule it Title 28, USC Section 1257.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.013" offset="541606">In view of that I would like to briefly summarize the factual and the history of this case in order to set the context for argument on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.070" offset="581834">Respondent was charged in a four-count information with rape, incest, involuntary deviant sexual intercourse, and corrupting the morals of children.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.343" offset="626974">The charging document alleged a course of conduct that spans some four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.282" offset="654768">The specific criminal episode giving rise to the charges, however, occurred in June of 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.536" offset="687787">Prior to trial, respondent initiated discovery proceedings seeking, among other things, results or reports involving a medical examination counsel believed had taken place regarding the victim in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.580" offset="755914">Subsequently he issued a subpoena to the Children and Youth Services Agency of Allegheny County seeking review and total access to their confidential records pertaining to the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.490" offset="811607">The agency chose not to surrender those records to the respondent based on that subpoena, and as a result respondent's counsel, trial counsel filed a pleading called a motion for sanctions and a hearing was convened at the trial court level.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.534" offset="887780">At the hearing, respondent informed the trial court that he had to have access to these medical records in preparation for trial, and also that he was aware that there had been conversations between the complaining victim and a Children and Youth Services caseworker.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.282" offset="962699">In addition to those alerts, red flags for the court below, respondent's counsel also said that there is possible witnesses, witnesses not known to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.440" offset="1019333">There could be witnesses in those records that could be useful in my defense, matters that could be favorable to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.028" offset="1045664">Based on that presentation the trial court denied relief, denied access to these records, and characterized, I think correctly, the assertions or the offer of proof by respondent's trial counsel as too vague and nonspecific.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.692" offset="1128316">Of course, as the Court is aware, respondent proceeded to trial, was convicted by a jury, and ultimately sentenced to a term of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.380" offset="1167081">The intermediate appellate court of Pennsylvania, the Superior Court, without having considered or having access to the notes of testimony from that pretrial hearing, concluded that the procedures employed by the trial court below failed to protect the respondent's confrontation rights, his privileges there.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.878" offset="1249106">A remand was ordered and the trial court was directed to review these records for purposes of determining whether or not there was a statement by the victim pertaining to abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.936" offset="1293305">So far so good as far as the commonwealth is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.554" offset="1311800">But inexplicably the court determined that respondent's counsel must be given access to the entire file, unexpurgated, unexcised, to determine whether or not... in order to be able to present argument concerning relevancy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1094.696" offset="4516397">In returning to the merits, the Commonwealth would observe that the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania erred in three specific respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.806" offset="4568851">It misconstrued or misapplied the application of the confrontation clause in the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.524" offset="4591735">It erroneously concluded that counsel's otter at the pretrial proceeding was a sufficient preliminary demonstration of materiality so as to trigger, if there is a compulsory process issue here, that clause, and it incorrectly concluded, we believe, that the two clauses in effect have... cannot countenance the ex parte judicial review of these confidential records which the Commonwealth insists must occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.812" offset="4712838">The privilege of confrontation is exclusively a trial right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.097" offset="4729975">The situation complained of here Involves a pretrial decision involving pretrial matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.238" offset="4770517">Facially the confrontation clause is not applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.190" offset="4786399">The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania relied on Davis v. Alaska as dispositive of the issue, falling to understand, I believe, that the constitutional error that this Court found in Davis v. Alaska was the restriction on the trial lawyer's attempt to cross examine a witness concerning his juvenile status, attempting to coax from him the fact that he might have suspect motives in testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.376" offset="4907085">This is an inapt analogy, we believe, to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.863" offset="4929028">It may very well be that the compulsory process clause provides perhaps more expansive privilege, and if it does it might be applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.171" offset="4970301">Certainly the compulsory process clause is available to a criminal defendant in a pretrial context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.806" offset="4992871">Privileges guaranteed under that clause, we think, however, require a respondent, a defendant to identify with some particularity the witnesses or the evidence that he would seek to have the court compel for his use at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.370" offset="5067059">The respondent's litany of could be's does not meet that minimal test of materiality which this Court has discussed most recently in United States versus Valenzuela Bernal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.546" offset="5123797">There the Court determined that it is imperative upon the person seeking access to what apparently is information he cantor possibly know the contents of to make some plausible theory about how a witness might be used, what that witness might be capable or competent to describe, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.662" offset="5220241">Under this Court's discussion there, I believe, which is dispositive of the compulsory process clause issue before this Court, it cannot be doubted that the offer by the respondent was so vague, so generalized, so undirected that the trial count simply had no information upon which to exercise its discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.277" offset="5318670">I would hasten to assure the Court that the respondent was very well aware of the names of the caseworker who was involved in interviewing the child, the name of the doctor who treated or examined the victim, and that he very well could have sought the trial court's assistance in isolating statements made by either one of those parties that might be in that tile because those people would be competent to testify about some aspect presumably of the criminal defendant's preparation for trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1545.771" offset="6320727">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case provides an opportunity for this Court to reaffirm its concern for the integrity of the truthseeking function of state criminal trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.076" offset="6457922">The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has held in this case that the integrity of its criminal trials, the truthseeking function embodied in those trials is paramount to this privilege statute, a statute created under Pennsylvania law, and in doing so it did not render that statute unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.178" offset="6574324">It did not declare that statute unconstitutional, but interpreted that statute and sent the case back to the trial court for determination of whether there is material in the CWS files, the Child Welfare Service files to determine further if that material, if relevant the suppression of that material was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and if a new trial was warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.281" offset="6686755">In doing so, the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, we would state to this Court, is not a final decision under Section 1257.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.374" offset="6755091">Certainly it does not fit the classic definition of finality because there are a number of things for the trial court to do other than simply to record a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.050" offset="6809844">The trial court must hold an evidentiary hearing in camera to determine the relevancy at the material in the CWS files.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.322" offset="6842863">It must determine if the suppression of such evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and if necessary determine whether a new trial was warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.278" offset="6882673">Furthermore, this case does not present itself as a classic example of those kind of cases which this Court identified in Cox Broadcasting Company as being a final judgment for purposes of appeal to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.941" offset="6961354">There are a number of things to be done in the lower court, and the issue that the district attorney of Allegheny County is presenting to this Court will not evade review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.849" offset="7012972">If the material goes back... if this case goes back to the trial court and a new trial is granted then the district attorney can then once more go through the various stages of appeal and bring this case to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1753.906" offset="7153197">And what the state wants to do is to prevent access to these records insofar as the Constitution will permit, and if this case goes back the records will be turned over to counsel and harm will be done, and that is precisely what the state wants to prevent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1816.247" offset="7402615">And that is that by interpreting the Sixth Amendment claim in this fashion it is saying that the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has applied excessive federal regulation to a state statute, and in that manner is attempting to bring this case to this Court under the rubric of a Sixth Amendment case when in fact the district attorney has not suffered a Sixth Amendment injury, and it is not the type--</text>

            <text syncTime="1956.237" offset="7962575">Secondly, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania remanded this case to the trial court with instructions that this material be reviewed in camera and that appropriate protective orders be imposed upon counsel for the dissemination of that material, so that this material is not going to be disseminated widely to the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="2786.374" offset="11283052">We have set forth in our brief several steps that one can go through in analyzing whether or not defense counsel should participate, one of which is whether or not the case is factually complex in itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.768" offset="11352642">I suggest that when this type of criminal case arises where you have claims of abuse arising in a family relationship that is a quite complex factual determination, and a trial judge sitting... the best trial judge sitting as objectively as he possibly can, in looking at this material would or may very well overlook something that would have great significance to the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.460" offset="11507392">In looking at the privilege statute that is the bone of contention in this case, one of the classes of categories of individuals who have access to this information is a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.515" offset="11639676">We argued in the state courts, and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania agreed with us, that it would be absurd to suggest that a court is granted access to this file, and yet it is not free to use that material to assist in the truthseeking function of the criminal trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.630" offset="11736120">In determining which remedy should be applied in looking at this material contained in the file, whether or not defense counsel should participate, we have set forth in our brief two alternate lines of cases looking at this particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.047" offset="11849805">One was under the dicta of this Court in the case of United States versus Nixon, where the Court suggested that the case would be remanded back to the trial court in order to have the trial judge review this material in chambers with counsel present and counsel would then... or the trial judge would then have the benefit of counsel's advice on determining what information is relevant and material to the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.303" offset="11994837">The second line of cases that we have outlined for the Court in our brief concerns those cases arising under the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.111" offset="12037991">These cases arise under the various courts, federal courts of appeals, and in those situations the courts have required the party withholding the information to prepare affidavits indicating why the information should not be turned over to the opposing party, and also an affidavit to assist the judge, the trial Judge in reviewing the material.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.851" offset="12176962">Both the affidavit and the material would then be sealed and... placed under seal for review by appellate courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.659" offset="12224192">Since that procedure was not used in the present case and... we would submit to the Court that in the absence of such a procedure defense counsel must assist the trial judge in determining the materiality of this material in order to ensure the integrity of this truthseeking process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.178" offset="12342265">With no further questions, I would request the Court to affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.</text>

            <text syncTime="3094.022" offset="12513733">It is kind of an enfeebled referee or arbiter, which this Court has specifically declined to assign to the trial court judge in situations like that, and in the case of United States versus Mobles this Court clearly indicated its disfavor with the contention that the trial court should not be in the position of evaluating preliminarily these kinds of determinations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3159.214" offset="12774435">I believe on a question that Justice Brennan asked regarding whether or not, if we went back on a remand, whether or not the proceeding would be decided under the immunity statute or under the old statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.022" offset="12825635">I think in view of the fact that the amendments to the statute involve the new access to prosecutors and the issue before this Court is the access of defendant to those statutes, that more appropriately the proceedings should occur under the 1975 Act rather than the 1982 amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.887" offset="12917168">And in view of the fact that the scant proffer concerning materiality by the respondent, our lack of access initially to those records, and respondent's failure to follow up his request at the cross examination stage at trial, we believe that the integrity of the judgment and conviction here is best served by analyzing the case under the 1975 Act, Your honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.454" offset="13023434">If there are no further questions from the Court the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania would ask this Court to reverse the Judgment of sentence below, rather, the judgment and order by the Supreme Court, and in effect affirm the trial court's decision.</text>
