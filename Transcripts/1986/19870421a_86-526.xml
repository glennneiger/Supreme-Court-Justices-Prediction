            <text syncTime="354.610" offset="1551634">The district court ruled that respondents' complaint was properly removed to Federal court, since the complaint stated Federal claims arising under Section 301.</text>

            <text syncTime="383.446" offset="1666991">The Ninth Circuit reversed, ruling that the case was not properly removed, and this Court granted a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.485" offset="1703145">Our argument can be summarized briefly as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.087" offset="1717564">First, this Court has clearly ruled that, contrary to the Ninth Circuit, Federal removal jurisdiction cannot be conditioned on the existence of a superseding Federal remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.013" offset="1773257">This Court has reaffirmed as recently as its April 6th unanimous decision in Taylor that removal jurisdiction is proper if a purported state claim falls within the broad preemptive reach of Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.206" offset="1838041">Thus, the second and critical issue is whether the state claims asserted here fall within the scope of Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.997" offset="1881195">Quite simply, these claims fall within the scope of Section 301 since, in the words of Allis-Chalmers v. Lueck, they are inextricably intertwined with the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.506" offset="1939292">The first issue, the removal issue raised by this case, is a question of Federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.029" offset="1973355">It is an issue separate and entirely distinct from the issue of remedy mistakenly identified by the Ninth Circuit as the basis for its decision that this case should be remanded to state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.722" offset="2036154">This Court's decisions in Franchise Tax Board and Avco and its recent decision in Taylor established the indisputable proposition that the issue of whether or not plaintiffs would obtain a remedy is entirely irrelevant to the courts' removal jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1482.832" offset="6064549">The Court there dealt with preemption under ERISA, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.118" offset="6077714">But under ERISA, the ERISA provisions were closely tailored to the complete preemption notion of preemption announced in 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.960" offset="6133094">The Court said, the touchstone of a Federal district court's removal jurisdiction is not the obviousness of the preemption defense, but the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.899" offset="6176875">We must honor that intent, whether preemption was obvious or not, at the time this suit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.839" offset="6204565">So the contention made by respondents that this Court may look nowhere beyond the face of its complaint, in a 301 context, we submit, is not a proper construction of this Court's decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1556.880" offset="6360777">The answer to the question as to how long the Respondents were employed in management positions or positions outside the bargaining unit is set forth in note 3 of Respondents' brief, and that is varying periods of time ranging from three to 15 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1572.889" offset="6424830">That is in the record, yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.758" offset="6432248">The issue in this case is whether Respondents' claims, which are based solely on contracts entered into by the parties while the Respondents were employed in positions outside the collective bargaining unit, are removable under the doctrine of complete preemption, solely because after the Respondents entered into these contracts of employment they were downgraded into positions covered by the collective bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.974" offset="6529110">This case is not about the merits of any substantive preemption defense, but it is about the form in which those questions should be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.849" offset="6568608">This is not a case which raises a question of whether we are right or wrong in our view that our claims are not preempted by federal labor law, but rather a basic question as to whether or not this complaint is removable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.024" offset="6629316">Our contention is that the unusual facts of the well-pleaded complaint in this case do not fall within the doctrine of complete preemption, because the cause of action we have alleged is not covered by section 301 and the collective bargaining agreement and the cause of action that we are claiming does not require the resolution of any question of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.341" offset="6738612">The facts in this case, which have already been discussed, show that our contract claims were entered into while the Respondents were solely... were employed solely in positions outside the collective bargaining unit, and that thereafter they were downgraded into the bargaining unit and then terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.970" offset="6813114">However, one of the plaintiffs, Fred Chambers, was... let me start again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.409" offset="6846864">The complaint was removed to the federal court after... we sued in state court alleging a violation of the contract claims which were entered into while my clients were outside the bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.651" offset="6895870">The case was removed to federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.419" offset="6906946">It was thereafter dismissed on the grounds that it was preempted by section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.839" offset="6928575">The claims of one of the plaintiffs, Fred Chambers, were remanded to state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.993" offset="6953234">The reason that his claims were remanded, unlike the claims of any of the other Respondents who are here today, was that Mr. Chambers never was downgraded into a collective bargaining unit position after he entered into the same contracts that the Respondents here today allegedly entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.307" offset="7030452">We believe that the test for removability in this case should be determined by looking to the source or the basis of the rights which have been claimed to be violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.447" offset="7083011">In the Avco case, the source of the alleged state cause of action was a no-strike provision in a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.903" offset="7116866">In the Lueck case, the source of the preemption defense in the finding that section 301 preempted that state action was a collective bargaining provision providing for the payment of disability benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.195" offset="7170051">In the Taylor case, the source of the contract right was a federally covered ERISA plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2010.522" offset="8175347">That is irrelevant, Caterpillar says, in complete preemption cases arising under section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.493" offset="8199171">However, the principle Caterpillar relies upon to establish the preemptive impact of section 301 is derived from a case involving National Labor Relations Act preemption, the J.I. Case case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.253" offset="8250266">Petitioners argue that J.I. Case means that whether the employees antecedently created contracts of employment survived the subsequently negotiated collective bargaining agreements or were surperseded and extinguished thereby is a question of federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2047.480" offset="8323200">This is a question of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.916" offset="8336888">But the principle of exclusivity and the primacy of the collective bargaining agreement derive not from section 301 and not from the collective bargaining agreement itself, but rather from the National Labor Relations Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2083.469" offset="8467083">And thus, in response to a question that Justice O'Connor asked earlier, we believe that if a federal preemption defense based upon labor law is applicable at all to this case, it is a Garmon balancing test, it is not a section 301 test.</text>

            <text syncTime="2109.621" offset="8571677">Arbitrators deal with questions of interpretation and application of provisions in collective bargaining agreements where claim is made that the collective bargaining agreement has been violated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2162.339" offset="8782642">The question of the impact of the collective bargaining agreement upon the individual contracts of employment can only be a defensive claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.093" offset="8813571">The only way that this cause of action is removable is if it falls within the complete doctrine of... complete preemption doctrine of section 301.</text>

            <text syncTime="2200.714" offset="8936137">Caterpillar urges the Court to hold that arising under jurisdiction exists because the individual contracts in question were automatically merged into and superseded by the bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.188" offset="8985979">Petitioners' unique and unprecedented request should be rejected for two reasons:</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.592" offset="9011579">First of all, it is defensive;--</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.913" offset="9028924">And secondly, it is far from clear that any merger of the individual contracts into the collective bargaining agreement actually occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.102" offset="9065600">For literally a full century, this Court, consistent with the express intent of Congress, has held that claims of federal preemption raised in a defensive manner do not provide removal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.093" offset="9117636">As illustrated before, the situation with Fred Chambers, the plaintiff who was not in the bargaining unit at the time he was terminated, he was permitted to take his case back to the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.753" offset="9176255">The remaining Respondents were dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.990" offset="9193182">The only difference between Chambers and the remaining Respondents is the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.292" offset="9214394">Thus, the collective bargaining agreement is defensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.863" offset="9232679">In addition to the defensive nature of the Petitioners' preemption claim, it is of course far from clear that the Respondents' claims are preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.586" offset="9279595">We know of no proposition of federal law that requires merger per se of the individual contracts with the collective bargaining agreement, unless there can be a showing that the parties to the first contract, the employee and the employer, agreed to such a merger and that the collective bargaining agent for the employees, the union, agreed to that merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.352" offset="9370606">This Court specifically acknowledged in J.I. Case the possibility that individual contracts of employment could coexist simultaneously with a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.826" offset="9420552">Moreover, J.I. Case specifically stated that any discontinuance of the individual contracts as a result of a collective bargaining agreement was without prejudice to the right of any employee to pursue damages under that contract or any defense by the employer thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.007" offset="9501218">We believe also, as previously noted, that the Belknap case supports our notion that, if this case... if preemption is involved at all in this case, it is defensive preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.215" offset="9550119">In that particular case, collective bargaining... employees were hired during a strike and were allegedly promised permanent employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.070" offset="9589512">The strike was settled and those employees were terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.640" offset="9607798">The settlement, the provisions of the collective bargained strike settlement, required the employer to rehire the strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.878" offset="9640712">Pursuant to that, the employer laid off the employees hired during the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.317" offset="9666521">This Court held on the merits of the preemption claim in that case that the claims were not preempted, even though the collective bargaining agreement required the reinstatement of the strikers to collective bargaining unit positions which had previously been occupied by the strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.279" offset="9738306">How, given the Belknap decision on the merits of the preemption claim, can Petitioners seriously contend that this case is removable under the doctrine of complete preemption?</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.717" offset="9784072">Finally, application of the well-pleaded complaint rule will permit the state court to take evidence on the question of the preemption defense and to determine what, if any, impact the collective bargaining agreement had on the individual preexisting contracts of employment which are alleged to exist by our complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.702" offset="9884069">Allowing this case to be remanded to the state court will permit the case to possibly be resolved without reference to any federal defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.593" offset="9939657">The result that Petitioners seek here is essentially a ruling that any time an employee is in a collective bargaining unit covered by a collective bargaining agreement his claims are preempted, regardless if he attempts to allege a claim under state law and regardless of the source of those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.225" offset="10030146">That argument would take the scope of section 301 and its preemptive impact far beyond the scope of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2533.930" offset="10269009">Surely Congress did not intend such a result.</text>

            <text syncTime="2545.887" offset="10316761">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.041" offset="10341421">First of all, I would like to deal with the Respondents' argument that Garmon Machinists and Belknap balancing type of preemption governs this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.730" offset="10384157">I think this Court's decision in the Lueck case, the unanimous decision in that case, has rejected the use of balancing preemption in the context of a case arising under section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.274" offset="10446328">The Court stated:</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.658" offset="10451866">"The balancing of federal and state interests required by Garmon preemption is irrelevant, since Congress, acting within its power under the commerce clause, has provided that federal law must prevail. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.034" offset="10509336">And it's our contention that that is precisely the scope of the district court's examination of the case upon removal to federal court: Does it fall within the scope of section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.293" offset="10566387">Finally, national labor policy is founded on the Congressional mandate that claims relating to collective bargaining agreements are to be resolved under uniform principles of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.653" offset="10627827">Respondents urge this Court to retreat from those principles and allow plaintiffs to define the scope of 301 and state courts, based on their own notions of the importance of state interests--</text>

            <text syncTime="2641.448" offset="10698985">All we're arguing about at this stage is where these questions are going to be decided, not how they're going to be decided, but simply whether the state court will get the first shot at it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2652.370" offset="10742766">But in any event, their contention is that the state court would then balance the interests, the state interest against the federal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.944" offset="10784980">And under the circumstances we have before this Court, it's our contention that that's a proper role for the federal court to decide.</text>

            <text syncTime="2671.684" offset="10819984">Because the Petitioner here--</text>

            <text syncTime="2683.025" offset="10865332">And we don't contend that the state court does not have the power to evaluate those federal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.630" offset="10899710">Our contention is in fact that there is concurrent jurisdiction between the state and the federal courts under 301, and the fact of concurrent jurisdiction reveals that it is a federal claim in nature under 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.990" offset="10965225">It is recharacterized as a 301 claim and therefore properly removed to federal court under the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.115" offset="11005662">Such a retreat, we submit, would generate conflicting results in interpreting collective bargaining agreements based on the variety of state laws of implied contract, covenants of good faith and fair dealing, employment at will, and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.957" offset="11069088">Conflicts such as these are inconsistent with our basic labor law principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.444" offset="11091030">We urge this Court to reconfirm these basic principles and reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
