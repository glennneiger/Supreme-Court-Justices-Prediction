            <text syncTime="1131.711" offset="4680795">Mr. Rush has just told you that the ICC wants a ruling on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.663" offset="4696573">Let me assure you that the Missouri-Kansas-Texas would be delighted with a ruling on jurisdictional grounds, if the ruling of this Court is that the Court of Appeals did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal of the unions below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.071" offset="4742235">That's precisely what we argued to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.256" offset="4750908">We moved to dismiss the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.423" offset="4759581">The decision of the ICC approving the merger was dated October the 20th, 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.593" offset="4784345">According to Judge MacKinnon, he found that the time for an appeal under the Hobbes Act expired on December the 20th, 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.932" offset="4817677">Yet a petition for clarification, filed by the unions, the BIE in this case, was not filed with the Commission until April the 4th, 1983.</text>

            <text syncTime="1196.904" offset="4941497">Well, it's not raised in our cert petition, but the government raised it in there, as a preliminary matter in its belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.658" offset="4972531">And we would subscribe to the government's view on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.193" offset="4986742">Turning to the merits, the Commission conditioned its approval of the Union Pacific-Missouri Pacific-Western Pacific merger upon a grant of a competitive trackage rights application, filed by the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.101" offset="5042330">In that application, Katy proposed to use its own crews, and to operate over the lines of its principal competitor, the Missouri Pacific, between Kansas City and Omaha.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.575" offset="5084231">The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and the United Transportation Union represent employees on both the Katy and the Missouri Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.062" offset="5114219">Despite the fact that both of those unions entered into implementing agreements with Katy, on behalf of Katy employees, that provided that the Katy employees would provide the operations in this trackage rights application, those unions argue in this case that Missouri Pacific employees have rights under the Railway Labor Act to bargain with the Missouri Pacific concerning the crewing of Katy's trackage rights operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.361" offset="5211395">If the unions are correct that this negotiation is governed by the procedures of the Railway Labor Act, then the unions would have the right to strike over this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.616" offset="5248384">We agree with the government's analysis of the fundamental errors in the Court of Appeals interpretation of the consolidation provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.489" offset="5279940">We would emphasize that this statutory scheme was enacted by Congress to encourage railroad consolidations; and according to the legislative history, to restore to the carriers all initiative in formulating consolidation proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.649" offset="5336573">Indeed, this Court noted in United States versus Interstate Commerce Commission, that although the Commission in fulfilling its statutory responsibilities is to carefully review all of the terms of a merger proposal, and determine whether they are just and reasonable, it is not for the agency, much less the courts, to dictate the terms of the merger agreement once this standard has been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.729" offset="5424867">Unions or other parties contesting trackage rights applications have never been given the rights to change the terms of the carriers' proposals, as the unions in this case seek to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.137" offset="5470529">Rather, those parties are given an opportunity to demonstrate to the Commission that the proposed terms and conditions are inconsistent with the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.576" offset="5504280">The Court of Appeals' decision is inconsistent with the decisions of this Court, particularly Schwabacher v. United States and Texas v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.249" offset="5534895">In Schwabacher, the Court held that once the Commission approved a railroad merger under Section 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act, the predecessor of Sections 1130... 343 and 11344, the approved transaction goes into effect without the need for invoking any approval under State authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.941" offset="5601664">This answers the question that you raised, Justice Stevens, about the date of the effect of the Commission's exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.178" offset="5626637">That exemption was... went into effect as soon as the Commission approved the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.499" offset="5647953">And in this instance, after the Court of Appeals ruled on the appeal from that decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1391.543" offset="5720155">The focus, in my judgment, and in our judgment, has to be on the impact of the statute, and what would happen under the statute if the carriers were not exempted from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.749" offset="5760906">Even if the crew provisions were left blank, giving the unions the right to negotiate under the Railway Labor Act, the identity of the crews would also give them a concomitant right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.372" offset="5811375">And if they're given the right to strike, then the trackage rights operation can be frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.110" offset="5830392">And that's what the Commission recognized in its decisions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.812" offset="5849200">And that's what... one of the main reasons Congress intended for these exemptions to apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="1449.396" offset="5951496">You'll see that there's another provision of the labor protective conditions that provides that the carriers have a right to arbitrate over the implementation of their agreements, in Article I Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.103" offset="5998307">And clearly this right to arbitrate is not found in the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.424" offset="6015653">This right to arbitrate disputes in implementations necessarily involves the overriding of collective bargaining agreements, especially in seniority matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.161" offset="6046582">And so we believe that that Article I Section 2 on the preservation of collective bargaining rights must be read in the context of the other labor protective conditions that are imposed; and more importantly in this case, in the context of the Commission's approval of the transaction at issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1575.643" offset="6456495">If the Court of Appeals' necessity standard that it adopted were applied to the facts of Schwabacher, the carriers would not have been able to be exempted from the Michigan State law at issue there, since the State law did not preclude the merger from being implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.570" offset="6516263">Likewise, applying the majority's rationale to the facts of Texas v. the United States would lead to the conclusion that the carriers could not be exempted from the State statute at issue in that case, for the same reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.544" offset="6560149">But the most glaring error in the majority's opinion is its failure to assess whether the Railway Labor Act procedures sought to be enforced by the unions could frustrate the implementation of Katy's trackage rights operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.936" offset="6609677">Putting aside for the moment the fact that the unions never demonstrated that they had any Railway Labor Act rights that were being violated by the Katy's crewing decision, the court below failed completely to focus on the fact that the application of Railway Labor Act procedures, and especially the fact that the unions may strike under the statute, could frustrate the implementation of every rail transaction approved by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.849" offset="6693373">The most pertinent decision to this case on that score is the Eighth Circuit decision in Missouri Pacific Railroad v. United Transportation Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.288" offset="6727124">In enjoining the UTU from striking the Missouri Pacific in an effort to shut down Katy's trackage rights operations at issue in this case, in that decision, the Eighth Circuit found it inconceivable that Congress could have intended that a labor union would be able to participate in an ICC proceeding, as UTU did, and then, if dissatisfied with the results or a part thereof, strike a carrier to obtain the advantage it desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.753" offset="6820955">That is the same conclusion reached by the Commission in its October, 1983 decision in this case, when it specifically found that its approval of the transactions under Sections 11343 and 11344 necessarily carries with it an exemption from the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.180" offset="6882604">The Eighth Circuit decision again in Missouri Pacific v. UTU refutes any argument that a Railway Labor Act exemption is not necessary in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.936" offset="6913638">In its opinion enjoining the UTU's threatened strike, the District Court of Missouri found that the threatened strike of UTU would cause irreparable injury to Missouri Pacific and to thousands of shippers that it serves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.243" offset="6958882">The Eighth Circuit reasoned that the balance and efficiency which Congress sought to achieve through the Interstate Commerce Act provisions relating to rail consolidations would be essentially and materially frustrated if employees were free to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.217" offset="7006843">For these reasons, we suggest that the Court should reverse judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1878.089" offset="7666278">All past precedent that the Commission had ever issued before indicated that it had no jurisdiction over collective bargaining matters; that it had no authority in labor relations matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="1927.422" offset="7863659">It never indicated that by doing that that it was making employee rearrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.759" offset="7884975">And it always said that it wasn't tampering at all with the collective bargaining agreements, or making any accommodation insofar as to the employee work rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1947.267" offset="7942967">For example, I was going to get to that, this Court, in FLEA v. ICC in 1964, remanded the Southern Central of Georgia case back to the Commission because the Commission purportedly had not inserted Sections 4, 5 and 9 of the Washington agreement in the employee protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.779" offset="8009004">And when it went back to the Commission as a result of that, the Commission was confronted with the very same case that is here before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.650" offset="8040560">The Southern Railway in that case, on remand to the Commission, said, since the rearrangements were contained in our initial application, that means that the Commission's approval of the transaction permitted us to discharge the Central employees and give all of the jobs to the Southern Railway employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.196" offset="8114748">Further, the Commission said at that time that as a result of that the carrier was not required to give notice as would normally be required... they would normally be required to do under Section 4 of the Washington job... or the Commission-imposed conditions, which at that time were the New Orleans conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.558" offset="8180159">The Commission said, no, you have to file notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.593" offset="8192280">You have to give notice to the employee organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.627" offset="8204400">And the reason for that is, is that when we imposed the condition, we did not make any rearrangements of work forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.948" offset="8233762">We didn't do anything except place into effect the monetary conditions for the protection of employees who might be displaced or dismissed; and also provided a means whereby there would be a selection and allocation of work forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.172" offset="8286634">Which meant, in effect, that the parties would sit down and negotiate, after a certain period of time when the notice had been served, and they would either determine the equities, or if they were unable to do that, that that would be submitted to arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="2073.147" offset="8446503">That citation is at 331 ICC 151, and the discussion, I believe, was at pages 165 through 173.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.335" offset="8475238">And I believe that at page 165, the Commission mentioned this Court's decision in McLean v. U.S., an antitrust case, in which the Commission read that... and I believe that the Court's decision specifically say that there had to be an accommodation between Interstate Commerce Act and the Antitrust Act, that it didn't... Section 11341's predecessor did not automatically exempt the railroad from the antitrust laws; that there had to be something more than just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.903" offset="8581504">The Commission also cited the decision of the Fifth Circuit in the Texas and New Orleans case, which they... the Commission said required it to achieve some type of accommodation with Section 5 paren 11 of the Interstate Commerce Act which was the predecessor of the Section 11341, did not automatically exempt the carrier from the Railway Labor Act requirements or the contracts that were in effect at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.352" offset="8687352">As we see it, Your Honor, actually the Interstate Commerce Act and the Railway Labor Act are consistent with each other; that the bond that holds the two acts together is the employee protection; that the only thing in this case that had to be done under those employee protections would be the selection and allocation of work forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.615" offset="8764361">And as I indicated, that strictly is a determination as to the equity between the various employee groups that were involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="2176.547" offset="8860074">And as we've indicated, consistently throughout 60 years of the ICC administering the Interstate Commerce Act and the Railway Labor Act, the two acts have existed together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.455" offset="8915767">Congress during that entire period has regulated labor relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.092" offset="8934262">As a matter of fact, in 1934, 14 years after the predecessor to 11341 was enacted, Congress enacted the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.448" offset="8971773">And as this Court has found on numerous occasions, that's a very intricate statute that sets up the procedures for handling labor relations in the railroad industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.089" offset="9014301">And even though that... and Congress went further, and this Court has gone farther, that the Section 2 rights under the Railway Labor Act are to be enforced by the Federal courts; that major disputes are to be governed by the mediatory services of the National Mediation Board; representation disputes--</text>

            <text syncTime="2439.566" offset="9912182">As a matter of fact, Article 1, Section 2 of the conditions that had been imposed by the Commission in this case specifically retains the rates of pay rules, working conditions, collective bargaining agreements that were in effect, subsequent to being changed by subsequent collective bargaining agreements or by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.628" offset="9976443">And therefore, we had understood that those agreements would continue in effect, and that there wouldn't be any problem in regard to the situation that's now presented to the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2475.774" offset="10057004">As we find out now, the ICC some 20 years later, following Southern Central of Georgia, says, that that is superfluous language.</text>

            <text syncTime="2595.186" offset="10534627">They provide for certain notices that have to be served on the employees; and for other functions that have to take place.</text>

            <text syncTime="2619.015" offset="10630026">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.585" offset="10644237">At the beginning it might be wise to go back to the jurisdictional questions that's been raised here in the arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.655" offset="10668583">When the ICC's order... and that's the controlling aspect... is looked at, the order shows that rail labor's position was what the order imposed; not what the Katy and the Missouri Pacific several months later said the order meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.265" offset="10735039">The ICC's order that was issued in October of 1932 said that the trackage right application of the Katy and the Rio Grande were approved, but to the extent specified in the decision, and subject to the conditions for the protection of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.727" offset="10804838">The conditions for the protection of employees, as required by 11347 of the act, specifically required two things that are relevant to what we're dealing with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.416" offset="10843604">One, that the carriers, in consummating the transaction, had to preserve rates of pay, rules, and collective bargaining agreement of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.040" offset="10882056">And they shall be preserved until changed by applicable statute or collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.026" offset="10902013">Secondly, the conditions required that the carriers... all carriers... give notice to all interested employees who might be affected by a rearrangement of the forces, and that they negotiate, if requested by the unions, what's known as an implementing agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.703" offset="10972753">The implementing agreement, contrary to what is being said in this Court in the briefs... and just as a matter of an aside, if you'll look at the ICC's findings, beginning in the District Court... the Court of Appeals, and then on their petition, and then finally on their brief and their reply brief, you'll see a gradual progression into firmness, where before, in front of the District of Columbia... the Court of Appeals they stated that, yes, there is some language in the conditions that would support the unions' belief that all carriers had to participate in the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.144" offset="11106500">Now they say, we don't know where they came up with that idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.429" offset="11119666">It's incredible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.396" offset="11123532">Because the ICC's never held it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.297" offset="11131160">They've never held the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.864" offset="11137429">And the District Court, in the case that was before the... that's now before this Court on a cert petition to the Eighth Circuit that's still pending, in that case the District Court found that the ICC conditions required the Katy, as well as the xx, to give negotiating rights to the Missouri Pacific employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.611" offset="11216423">And they did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.146" offset="11222484">And the reason they did not was because the ICC found in the May 18th and the October opinions that are... that were subsequently reversed by the Court of Appeals, the reason they did not was because the ICC's order granted them an exemption from that requirement of the protective conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.624" offset="11300433">But when you go back and put the thing in its proper perspective, what you have in this case is an order of the Commission specifically imposing an obligation... limiting the applications that were filed, and imposing an obligation on the parties to consummate those transactions in compliance with those orders, with the employee protective conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.723" offset="11388831">Now, implementing agreements under the Interstate Commerce Act are not to implement the transaction, as the ICC is now saying, and as the carriers are saying, but historically, back from the time they were first... the requirement was first imposed back in 1936 by agreement, implementing agreements are to do two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.684" offset="11468662">One, to apply... and this right in Article 4 of the current provisions right now... to apply the basic terms and protections of the conditions, the protective conditions, to the particular transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.611" offset="11520384">The transactions, for example, give an employee protection against being required to relocate without... and changing his residence as a result of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.800" offset="11557164">The question of what is a change of... what is a required change of residence, if you have to move 30 miles, 40 miles or 50 miles, is that a required change.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.240" offset="11594885">That's a subject for implementing agreements, and it's normally devised... decided at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.942" offset="11613693">There are no claims procedures under the New York Dock conditions, and that's what an implementing agreement does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.011" offset="11637935">It establishes the claims procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.130" offset="11646503">It also has a second aspect, and that is, to provide the basis upon which the selection of forces will be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.486" offset="11683911">And it specifically provides, in any assignment of forces, shall be made on the basis of the agreement as to the selection or an arbitration decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2895.394" offset="11735528">I guess I got to go back to it, where I said it... the interstate... the protective condition itself does not authorize... when we're talking about the implementing agreement... it does not authorize the abrogation of collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.403" offset="11791535">Because the implementing agreement requirement, in the employee protective conditions, provides that... has two bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.409" offset="11827584">One, to provide for the application of those terms to the particular transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.896" offset="11845556">And two, to provide for the basis upon which the forces to perform the transaction that's involved will be selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.086" offset="11882232">And if the parties can't agree on that selection basis, that equity ratio, they are then to arbitrate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.240" offset="11906892">That's what arbitrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.656" offset="11912534">And you have to view that arbitration requirement in Article 1, Section 4 along with the requirement in Article 1, Section 2, that they preserve collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.397" offset="11955480">Historically, as we've shown in the arbitration decisions attached to the brief by the UTU, the Commission's decisions have not been viewed as abrogating or authorizing the abrogation of collective bargaining rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2999.478" offset="12151816">When the applications were filed by the Katy and the Rio Grande for the trackage rights, rail labor, the UTU in particular along with other unions, filed an opposition to that... to those applications and said, that if granted as requested they would adversely affect employees' interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.124" offset="12234467">And we asked that if they're approved, that they be approved subject to employee protective conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3088.536" offset="12508126">Supposing in October of 1982, all of the arguments that have been had here in this Court and since then were fleshed out before the Commission at that time, and the Commission said, well, we think we'll change the policy we've followed in the past, and with respect to the crew assignments, we think it makes sense, A, to let the leasee railroad use its own crews, and, B, not to have any strikes or arbitration over that issue, and that is what we intend, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.603" offset="12620348">Would they have had... and we say, we further find that it's necessary in order to effectuate the consolidation promptly and carry out the purposes of the act to do it that way... would they have had statutory authority to enter that order at that time?</text>

            <text syncTime="3130.630" offset="12676459">And the reason for that is that since the time that the Interstate Commerce Commission was first given the authority to authorize exemptions, and that exemption power is nothing more than a recognition of the supremacy of the Interstate Commerce Commission over the economic regulation of the railroads, it's a preemption and a supremacy provision, from that time when Congress gave the ICC that power, it also was regulating rail labor relations by Title III of the 1920 Transportation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.382" offset="12795473">Regulation of labor relations is separate and distinct from rail economic regulations by the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.571" offset="12828178">When the Commission authorizes an exemption, it can only... the exemption can only be of transactions that it has the power to authorize, or the jurisdiction over.</text>

            <text syncTime="3196.805" offset="12941132">Rail labor has had that veto from 1920 and even prior to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.340" offset="12959313">But the transactions haven't been... thousands of transactions have been authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.411" offset="12975613">And they haven't been frustrated by a right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.113" offset="12986376">The right to strike... and the need to strike is different than the right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.747" offset="13004871">The need to strike only comes about as a result of unilaterally imposed terms being imposed on the employees, as has occurred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.788" offset="13045099">That is why, since 1983, you've had the potential strike on the Missouri Pacific as a result of this; you had the potential strike on the Milwaukee, as shown in the cert petitions; you've had the potential strike up in Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.230" offset="13094836">All of these are because now you have the Interstate Commerce Commission saying it has a power over labor relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.250" offset="13118973">But since 1976, if there was any question on that, Congress has taken that away, by specifically saying, in the 1976 amendments, that from that date forward, all merger approvals and trackage rights... trackage rights approvals have to include provisions that do two things among others: preserve collective bargaining rights, and provide for the implementing agreements.</text>

            <text syncTime="3297.253" offset="13342895">You need a bridge to give the Missouri Pacific employees an ability to talk to the Katy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3344.748" offset="13532962">In that case, Your Honor, the employee protective conditions would most likely work out an arrangement that would give the other carrier all the rights, because it has the equity to perform the work.</text>

            <text syncTime="3357.040" offset="13582072">Now, in this case, the Missouri Pacific employees who performed the work as of January 3rd or January 6th suddenly stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.396" offset="13611538">Secondly, the Missouri Pacific employees went to the Missouri Pacific and they said, negotiate with us over two things: One, whether or not the Katy can come onto the property and leave us out of the picture; and two, negotiate with us over what you are going to do with our people who are suddenly affected by this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.392" offset="13691473">And the Missouri Pacific said we can't negotiate with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.344" offset="13703280">We have no right to talk to you because the ICC's order gave the Katy the authority to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.331" offset="13727208">And we can't negotiate with you about that because we can't control what they do.</text>

            <text syncTime="3401.402" offset="13759496">And it was at that point that the parties then began to take the diverging paths.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.806" offset="13777155">When it became clear to the UTU that the Missouri Pacific would not negotiate, they voted for and declared a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.477" offset="13803800">When it became clear to the--</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.412" offset="13811532">ICC and asked the ICC to refute what the Katy and Missouri Pacific and Rio Grande were saying the ICC's order meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.434" offset="13855626">Because the past practice has always been, the Interstate Commerce Commission order, even if the carriers put in the order in the application what they intended to do, that did not bind... or that did not become part of the order of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.146" offset="13918529">And that's the important thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.712" offset="13924799">Does an application that is submitted to the Commission that says, if we're granted this authority, here's how we'll do it, become an order of the Commission?</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.787" offset="13965132">Historically, it has never been an order, because the carrier does not have to do... consummate the transaction in the way in which it says, in its application, it will do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.392" offset="14007450">If it says in the application, we're going to use one train crew for 200 miles, the ICC's order certainly doesn't exempt that carrier from the hours of which prohibit 12 hours of service laws, more than work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.985" offset="14057919">And as a result of that, the application to the Commission is nothing more than a general blueprint which the Commission then uses to determine whether or not the financial transaction, namely, trackage rights, is in fact within the public interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3503.052" offset="14166170">Because in that case, the carriers did exactly what they're doing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.420" offset="14179649">They put in their application an employment contract which they said would govern the consolidated work.</text>

            <text syncTime="3519.078" offset="14230222">I'd ask you to take a look at the Southern Central case, because in that case, the carrier put into its application how it would go about consolidating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.184" offset="14266689">And it put all of the Southern people on the rosters, and took the Central of Georgia and put them at the bottom.</text>

            <text syncTime="3540.641" offset="14316531">And two of them were attached... two arbitration decisions were attached to the UTU brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.712" offset="14336802">One of them was a pre-1983 decision where Referee xx went through a tremendous history, including a Referee Fernstein decision under the Washington job agreement, where they specifically said that the conditions did not give the right to abrogate collective bargaining agreements.</text>

            <text syncTime="3568.910" offset="14429589">Yes, I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.660" offset="14440560">There's so much I disagree with Mr. Clarke on that it's hard to know where to start.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.314" offset="14459160">But I think perhaps the most fundamental issue is the question of Commission approval, and the effect that it has in connection with the employee protection conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.388" offset="14507434">First, I would note that in every case cited to you by rail labor, they have been dealing with the actual combining consolidating carriers themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.631" offset="14560410">In this case, that would be the Missouri Pacific, the Union Pacific and the Western Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.868" offset="14585383">The Missouri Pacific, the Union Pacific and the Western Pacific have honored the employee protection conditions as to rearrangement of forces, including the displacements resulting from their acquiescing in the condition imposed by the Commission that the Katy and the &lt;DRGW&gt; [= DRGW] be permitted to operate trackage rights utilizing their own crews.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.853" offset="14689351">There is no case anywhere holding that in the context of an imposed condition, or even in the context of a trackage rights situation, where the Commission has looked at a term and deemed it to be a material term, that RLA rights continue to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.099" offset="14778376">And the reason that there has never been a disputation on this is that until this case, labor has never asserted that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.038" offset="14814111">Turning to the question Justice O'Connor asked about what does the Commission guarantee of existing collective bargaining agreements mean, and coupling that with the other observation made that in 1976 with the amendment to 11347 Congress intended to require that existing collective bargaining agreements be preserved and kicked over into the RLA, the Commission's provisions, as the Commission explained, preserve collective bargaining simply to the extent of the approved transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.246" offset="14974921">If I may finish this sentence on the 11347 amendment, the Amtrak agreements which were required to be incorporated were added to ensure that all collective bargaining would not be eliminated because the railroads were transferring their operations to a semi-public Federally funded operation.</text>
