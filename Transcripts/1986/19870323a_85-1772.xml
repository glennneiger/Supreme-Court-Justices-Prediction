            <text syncTime="16.843" offset="217634">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.663" offset="240936">It is an equal footing doctrine case and involves the ownership of the bed of Utah Lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.750" offset="265282">Utah Lake is the largest fresh water lake in the State of Utah; has a surface area of approximately 150 square miles; is located in Utah County, which is roughly 40 miles south of Salt Lake City.</text>

            <text syncTime="47.814" offset="341559">Yes, not right adjacent, but within a few miles, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.051" offset="370503">Utah bases its claim of title on the equal footing doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.323" offset="399551">One aspect of that doctrine is that states when they enter the Union receive the beds of the navigable bodies of water within the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.381" offset="447825">These lands are held in trust by the United States pending statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.802" offset="473530">Thus, Utah asserts that when it entered the Union on January 4, 1896, it acquired the title to the bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.558" offset="508534">The United States, on the other hand, while conceding navigability and admitting that ordinarily Utah would have received title at statehood, asserts that it, in fact, retained title when some seven years prior to statehood the bed was withdrawn and reserved as a reservoir site by the United Geologic Survey.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.077" offset="626607">The Court below held for the United States and ruled that title did not pass to Utah at statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.032" offset="666418">The authority asserted for the 1889 withdrawal of the lake bed is an Act of Congress which was enacted in 1888.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.060" offset="738516">That act authorized the United States Geologic Survey to investigate the arid region of the United States to determine the extent to which it could be redeemed by irrigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.070" offset="802568">U.S.G.S. was authorized to select reservoir sites and segregate irrigable land in this arid region.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.509" offset="844364">The Act provides that all lands selected as reservoir sites, canals, ditches, as well as the lands made susceptible of irrigation by such reservoirs, canals, or ditches were reserved as property of the United States and not subject to entry, settlement, or occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.028" offset="954392">It is Utah's position that that act did not fall within the exception that this Court has recognized in order to defeat Utah's title.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.371" offset="1019803">As recently as 1981 in Montana v. United States, this Court summarized the rules that govern the exception; held that the United States may sometimes convey the bed of a navigable body of water prior to statehood if it is necessary to perform an international obligation or to satisfy a public exigency.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.092" offset="1150624">However, that intention to convey must be clearly and plainly expressed.</text>

            <text syncTime="331.561" offset="1476527">It is in this Court's analysis of the constitutional requirements for the exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.000" offset="1514248">In other words, in Montana, the Court noted that an Indian reservation, for example, may be an appropriate public purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.909" offset="1565971">But unless it rises to the level of an exigency, that alone is not sufficient to defeat state title.</text>

            <text syncTime="363.515" offset="1604319">Do you think there is any difference at all when the Federal Government wants to keep it for itself as opposed to conveying it to a third party?</text>

            <text syncTime="461.529" offset="1996364">And in each of those cases the Court did not allow the analysis to stop at the reservation stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.070" offset="2046519">It moved on to see if there had been a conveyance.</text>

            <text syncTime="521.948" offset="2238049">The problem we've got here is when there is not claim of a conveyance to a third party, is there a mechanism by which the United States can reserve property for its own use that will, in effect, survive the creation of a new state, and which I don't think we have addressed before, have we?</text>
            <text syncTime="538.977" offset="2306176">For example, is... say they wanted to keep property in a military reservation; could they do this, or whether the United States could do that: West Point and the Hudson River or something or... could they possibly have done that consistently with equal footing doctrine?</text>

            <text syncTime="3097.363" offset="12539698">Going back to the point of Congress's power to do this, because I think the statutory authorization is clear, we submit it would be anomalous for Congress to be able to provide for the disposition of land underlying navigable waters to a private party as the States concedes Congress can do and as the Court held in the Choctaw case and has said in Shively versus Bowlby and other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.763" offset="12645337">In that situation... and not to be able to retain the land in public ownership because when land is granted to a public party, it is separated from sovereignty in the words of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.019" offset="12686402">And both the State and the Federal Government lose whatever power they have to control the use of that land to the extent that power derives from ownership of the bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.475" offset="12724227">By contrast where the land is retained in federal ownership, the Federal Government can act both with reference to the special federal purpose that gave rise to the reservation in the first place and protect the interest in the use of the navigable waters in the same way as a public trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.254" offset="12791310">So the reasons for presuming against a conveyance to a private party of land underlying navigable waters apply with far less force in the situation where Congress has reserved the lands to a public use.</text>

            <text syncTime="3364.112" offset="13606748">And ten years prior to the 1888 Act, the United States recognized the navigability of the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.051" offset="13638513">It surveyed it, segregated it from the public domain, so that all of the sales of property were down to the surveyed meander line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.240" offset="13679264">And I think that simply is not a justifiable argument that the settlers would encroach upon the lake bed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3433.239" offset="13883228">But what we say is that one of the things the Federal Government does, and did at that time throughout the West, is when they... when there was these navigable bodies of water, in order to preserve them, they were surveyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.451" offset="13956057">That survey is a line that approximates the ordinary high-water mark which is the boundary of the bed and the upland owner.</text>
