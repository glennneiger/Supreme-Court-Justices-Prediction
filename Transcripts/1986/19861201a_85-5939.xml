            <text syncTime="16.943" offset="213921">The questions presented in this case were the ones left unresolved by this Court's decision in Parker versus Randolph.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.631" offset="248716">First, is the Bruton holding applicable where the state seeks to introduce confessions against both defendants?</text>
            <text syncTime="34.387" offset="283721">And secondly, if the Bruton rationale does not apply if confessions interlock, when do confessions interlock?</text>
            <text syncTime="42.993" offset="318098">In this case, the only direct evidence linking either Petitioner Eulogio Cruz or his co-defendant Benjamin Cruz to the crime were their confessions which the state introduced against them.</text>

            <text syncTime="57.003" offset="374209">Mr. Dean, a moment ago you said there were two questions presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.538" offset="388315">There is also a question, isn't there, as to whether this evidence was sufficiently reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.989" offset="406078">It might have been independently admitted against the Petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="69.161" offset="422796">The state is seeking to raise that point now for the first time before this Court, and in response we have two essential responses.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.432" offset="467936">One is that in fact, looking at the evidence that's available, they have not met their heavy burden of showing that the presumptive... the unreliable co-defendant's confession is reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.711" offset="528958">But in the first place, this Court should not even consider that question because it was not presented in the petitions for certiorari or the response to the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.536" offset="576292">It was not pressed or passed in the state courts, and therefore petitioner was not given an opportunity to make or contribute to the record on the question of whether this co-defendant's confession is reliable as evidence connecting petitioner to the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.348" offset="659570">The only question in the state trial courts and in the state appellate courts was whether this confession impacted upon the defendant, Eulogio Cruz.</text>

            <text syncTime="144.692" offset="724876">Don't you think, counsel, that there is a difference between arguing that it is admissible under a hearsay exception, and making that the basis for the admission, which is not what the state is trying to do here, and on the other hand arguing that the fact that it would have been had one sought to do that, renders the co-defendant's confession admissible?</text>

            <text syncTime="172.192" offset="834904">I understand the question, but I think the crucial thing here is that they are pointing to evidence which came out periodically through the record for reasons unrelated to this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.436" offset="883910">We never had a chance to contribute to the record on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.654" offset="900733">We never got a chance, because it wasn't an issue below, to help make the record to indicate that this confession was unreliable evidence as to our defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.195" offset="950992">What sort of a record would it take, beyond what you have, to determine whether the normal hearsay exception for admissions against interest, against penal interest, would apply here?</text>

            <text syncTime="216.121" offset="1010656">First of all, the motivation that Benjamin might have to falsely implicate the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.577" offset="1048481">We don't know what the relationship is between the brothers.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.112" offset="1062588">The state is assuming that there is some sort of presumption of brotherly love between two brothers, which I don't think in history or in practicality exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="243.555" offset="1120370">If a state is trying to introduce the co-defendant's confession as evidence of petitioner's guilt, surely we would have the opportunity to introduce, before the judge or the jury, evidence to indicate that he had a motive to falsify against the petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="269.289" offset="1223293">But do you have the right to introduce it for the purpose of saying that therefore the normal exception to the hearsay rule should not be applied?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert S. Dean</label>
            <text syncTime="300.494" offset="1348158">--Yes, all the New York State cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.779" offset="1361324">First of all, as to declaration against penal interest, this Court said in Lee versus Illinois that that was too broad a bevy of cases for confrontation clause analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.003" offset="1418166">But furthermore, whether a confession would be admissible as a declaration against penal interest, which is purely an evidentiary doctrine is of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.144" offset="1462783">This co-defendant's confession and its accusations in it against petitioner would not have been admissible under state law for a host of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.869" offset="1501654">One is that New York has a special rule when it comes to accomplices' confessions at the station house, that not only must it be against penal interest but it must be shown that there was not even a theoretical motive to fabricate.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.045" offset="1566333">That is to say, at that point in time the co-defendant was not cooperating with the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.365" offset="1587649">So, under the New York doctrine and the case of People versus Geoghegan which is cited in my reply brief, for that reason alone it wouldn't have been admissible as a matter of New York State law as a declaration against penal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.756" offset="1637177">But even more than that, under New York's rule only the self-accusatory portion of the statement would be admissible against the other defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.112" offset="1674584">So, if "A" is the co-defendant in this case, and he says, "A" and "B", "B" meaning my client, committed murder, under New York's doctrine only that portion, "A" committed murder, would be admissible against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.539" offset="1732367">And furthermore, under New York law, whatever the other evidence as to declaration against penal interest might be, the party against whom they seek to admit it would always have the opportunity to indicate by introduction of evidence that they would have the opportunity to show that the evidence was in fact unreliable and that the standard indicia of admissibility as a declaration against penal interest are illusory.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.975" offset="1850023">That's New York State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.593" offset="1856501">Had respondent sought to introduce the co-defendant's confession as substantive evidence against petitioner in this case, in New York State courts, it would not have been admissible under New York State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.686" offset="1916896">That argument is fully laid out in our reply brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="497.620" offset="2136638">But in any event, the co-defendant's videotaped confession was made after he was placed under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.339" offset="2155551">So, we're dealing with a post-arrest videotaped confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.476" offset="2172060">The videotaped confession of the co-defendant in this case was a 22-minute videotape taken by a Bronx County Assistant District Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.034" offset="2222320">The alleged confession that the state introduced against petitioner was introduced through the testimony of a single witness, Norberto Cruz whose testimony, we submit, was generally unworthy of belief.</text>

            <text syncTime="928.916" offset="3861869">It's definitely reliable as evidence against its declarant, Benjamin Cruz.</text>

            <text syncTime="966.791" offset="4013275">Our argument is that it's not admissible in this case because, first, it's not reliable and secondly, because of the procedural bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.415" offset="4055802">This case might have been different had it been litigated in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.403" offset="4083805">We submit that the jury in this case would naturally look to the co-defendant's confession in order to resolve its doubts about whether petitioner's confession was ever uttered.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.293" offset="4135319">From a trial lawyer's standpoint, if I'm a trial lawyer and I'm representing Eulogio Cruz in state court, the only evidence against my client other than a lot of forensic evidence which indicates that a crime took place but none of it directly linking my client to the crime, the only evidence is the testimony of Norberto Cruz who didn't tell the police about this alleged confession for six months and only told the police after his brother had been shot and petitioner, as the witness said, took him to the place where they had killed his brother.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.119" offset="4290591">Furthermore, the Court could examine the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.255" offset="4311175">Norberto's testimony in relevant part is fully printed in the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.476" offset="4336044">You can read it for yourselves, and you can see that cross examining this man was like pulling teeth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.730" offset="4357046">On direct examination he testified he was an auto mechanic by profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.367" offset="4375645">On cross examination he conceded he had never practiced in a shop or hadn't for the last ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.938" offset="4397902">The last ten years he practiced his trade on the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.489" offset="4412112">But, of course, later he admitted that at the first trial he had testified that he hadn't worked for the past two years; he had been receiving welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.226" offset="4443041">And of course, the jury would naturally wonder, what is this able-bodied man doing receiving welfare, and of course they'd be wondering whether he had reported his side income to the welfare board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.236" offset="4499152">But, all these factual matters were for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.005" offset="4510228">But we submit that a good case was made out that this evidence was in itself unreliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.759" offset="4533216">So, as a trial lawyer going into court with this evidence, a lot of forensic evidence which basically establishes a crime that was committed, and Norberto's testimony, I'd be fairly confident of an acquittal in that sort of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.466" offset="4583998">But if you pin onto my client the co-defendant's confession, which we know is uttered, it comes before the jury in a length of 22 minutes so they are not going to be able to blank it out of their mind in an instant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.226" offset="4639064">And, that confession fully implicates our client in the crime and we have no method of cross examining it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.397" offset="4663724">We can't bring out his earlier hearing testimony as a prior inconsistent statement, the hearing testimony being completely different from what he said on the videotape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.855" offset="4709595">We're not entitled to an instruction from the Court that as an accomplice his testimony must be corroborated as a matter of law by other evidence materially linking petitioner to the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.862" offset="4757660">We're not entitled to any of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.614" offset="4764661">We're not entitled to introduce other evidence to show the bias of this declarant as if he had been a witness on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.220" offset="4799038">We're not entitled to do any of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.520" offset="4804263">All we have is this co-defendant's confession which we have no way of challenging, and under those circumstances I'd be very worried about taking that case to trial because the state's case under those circumstances seems very persuasive, and we submit that that exactly is what the Bruton case is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.169" offset="4894855">Now, in relating the Lee versus Illinois case to the Bruton rule, we submit the relationship is simply this: if a co-defendant's confession is admissible under Lee versus Illinois, and this is of course assuming that the issue was litigated in the state court, then certainly there is no Bruton problem because the evidence comes in as substantive evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1322.005" offset="5434232">And in any event, the effect on the defendant's case is not going to be devastating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.842" offset="5457533">But, this case is an example of why you really have to look closer at whether interlocking occurs, because of course the jury is going to look to the co-defendant's confession in order to resolve its doubts about appellant's guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.990" offset="5530153">Just because the state introduces evidence that a co-defendant confessed, doesn't mean that the defendant has no case left and that there is no further point in challenging the co-defendant's confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.630" offset="5584697">Just as one example, under Crane versus Kentucky, the defendant has the option of relitigating the voluntariness of his confession to the jury, even if he has lost on that issue in a pretrial suppression hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.890" offset="5641748">Suppose he convinces the jury in a case where a judge has failed to redact or sever and there are two confessions, let's say the defendant convinces the jury that his confession was involuntary and therefore the jury should ignore it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.601" offset="5708517">Then, the case becomes factually indistinguishable from Bruton.</text>

            <text syncTime="1404.159" offset="5762748">If the defendant, despite the odds, with the co-defendant's confession being before the jury, convinces the jury that he never made his confession in the first place, then there's still the co-defendant's confession before the jury and the case is exactly the same, analytically and factually, as was presented in Bruton.</text>

            <text syncTime="2298.055" offset="9338388">With the Court's permission I would like to first begin by addressing the Parker versus Randolph point and then move back to the Lee versus Illinois point as a secondary point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.280" offset="9383319">On the Parker versus Randolph issue, let me say at the outset that the position of the United States is that the plurality decision in Parker was correctly decided and correctly reasoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.088" offset="9422503">We would ask the full Court to accept that rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.706" offset="9437027">This is not simply an issue of semantics or focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.158" offset="9454790">It has enormous practical significance from the standpoint of a trial judge, and what the trial judge should be doing, because if the Court adopts a harmless error approach, then the result is that even in an interlocking confession case it's error and the trial court is required either to sever the cases or to exclude the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.405" offset="9539740">If the Court adopts an interlocking confession rationale, on the contrary, the Court would be able to make an inquiry on whether there is in fact true interlocking, and if there is, proceed to a joint trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.880" offset="9589686">And the Parker versus Randolph case itself dramatizes the significance of the distinction.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Klonoff</label>
            <text syncTime="2368.349" offset="9619570">We defined it, Justice Blackmun, as the two confessions being substantially the same and consistent on all the major elements of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.341" offset="9655515">It's the approach that's been taken by the Second Circuit, and we cite a number of cases in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.328" offset="9679443">The Parker case is a dramatization of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.697" offset="9692922">Justice Blackmun observed in his concurring opinion that there was no substantial prejudice to any of the defendants as a result of the admission at the joint trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.469" offset="9732001">And there were five defendants that were tried together in Parker versus Randolph.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.521" offset="9748197">Now, if there was no substantial prejudice to any of the defendants, then the United States does not understand a rule that would nonetheless require severance, and in Parker we submit that it may have required five separate trials even though we agree that none of the defendants was prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.632" offset="9812668">So, we think that the better approach to a harmless error is a question of interlocking confessions, and the definition we suggest to the Court deals with many of the problems that were addressed by Justice Blackmun and by the defendant Parker, because we concede that there does have to be full interlocking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.844" offset="9885497">A statement such as the one in Justice Stevens' hypothetical about somebody who simply acknowledges being with someone else at the time of a crime, that's enough... that's not enough under the government's view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.319" offset="9935443">That would not be interlocking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.437" offset="9939936">So, that hypothetical would not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.139" offset="9950699">The statements would have to agree on the elements of the offense so that one would not supply anything that the other one would not have.</text>

            <text syncTime="2472.969" offset="10038052">So, we would submit that there is interlocking under the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.040" offset="10058323">Now, the rationale of Parker versus Randolph... Justice Stevens had asked the question... there are several points that should be made in that regard, as to why the rationale of the plurality is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.847" offset="10113598">First of all, it proceeds from the assumption that juries can and will follow instructions, and that is the general rule, and we submit that Bruton is the exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.970" offset="10150065">We would also say that that rule is not a fiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.357" offset="10163544">If it were, defense lawyers and prosecutors would not argue at length about the precise wording of instructions that go to juries, and appellate courts would not reverse convictions because of--</text>

            <text syncTime="2526.354" offset="10251525">--Because, for example, if one confession makes out all of the elements to, say, a murder and the other one only makes out the elements to a manslaughter, then the jury might be tempted to fill a gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.745" offset="10297187">It's precisely the analysis in Parker, is will the jury be tempted to look to the co-defendant's confession in order to fill a gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.165" offset="10326862">And when they interlock, then there really is nothing in the co-defendant's confession that is not also in the defendant's confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.671" offset="10352880">So, it's the interlocking on the elements of the offense that would really make the jury resist looking at the co-defendant's confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.092" offset="10386525">Now, the Parker case really has two separate but related rationales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.479" offset="10404080">The first is that the defendant who has also confessed is harmed less by a jury's failure to follow the instructions to keep the confession separate, the type of a harmless error analysis, and really it could be... a related point is that cross examination of the co-defendant in that circumstance would be less useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.928" offset="10497912">And the second point is simply that in this context, where the confessions genuinely interlock, there is less temptation on the part of the jury to look to the co-defendant's confession and we would note that many, many courts have adopted this doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.986" offset="10554127">It's a doctrine that was adopted by the Second Circuit almost immediately after the Bruton case because of its logical appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.424" offset="10587877">Now, also on the point of whether these confessions interlock, I would make one point, to... just to clarify the record in terms of perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.578" offset="10616508">There's been constant reference to a 22-minute confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.046" offset="10630300">The confession... the tape of the confession has been lodged with the Court and I would urge the Court to examine it because much of it has to do with the translation, with the advising of rights, and really the confession of the co-defendant dealing with the crime in question occupies six pages of the Joint Appendix--</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.992" offset="10698114">So, there is not really the disparity that the shorthand reference of the 22-minute--</text>

            <text syncTime="2663.975" offset="10802081">But we would just suggest, as the New York Court of Appeals pointed out in footnote 2 of its opinion, there is absolutely nothing in the record to suggest that Norberto had any motive to falsely accuse the petitioner of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.533" offset="10852341">That was just thoroughly rejected by the New York Court of Appeals based on a review of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.437" offset="10871881">So, there really is not that motive in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.571" offset="10880449">In fact, as this Court noted in Chambers versus Mississippi, a statement made to a long-time friend may in fact be the most reliable type of statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.726" offset="10917020">Let me, if I could, move to the Lee versus Illinois point in the time remaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.713" offset="10936978">In terms of the distinction between this case and Lee versus Illinois, there are really three points that should be emphasized because the Court in that case found that the co-defendant's confession was not sufficiently reliable to come in as substantive evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.825" offset="11001448">And by the way, the substantive evidence argument, let me indicate, is not that it was actually introduced as substantive evidence, but that since it could have been introduced as substantive evidence, the defendant is not in a position to complain where the confession in fact was introduced only against the co-defendant with limiting instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.502" offset="11068217">So, it's an a fortiori type argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.036" offset="11078352">But there are three important distinctions between this case and Lee, and the first case... and in fact, it relates to your point, Justice Stevens... the fact that the confession was on videotape makes this case totally different than Lee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.677" offset="11124850">It really enhances the reliability from the Lee versus Illinois analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.331" offset="11143450">And really, the jury was able to focus on the demeanor of Benjamin and they were able to see the circumstances of the statement as the statement was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.187" offset="11182947">So, although there was not cross examination, there were still other aspects that the confrontation clause was designed to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.175" offset="11210845">Secondly, the videotaped confession could be looked at, really, as only a more extensive--</text>

            <text syncTime="2781.701" offset="11272912">I mean, the two arguments are just crossing one another.</text>

            <text syncTime="2796.527" offset="11332263">--That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.960" offset="11338010">We would agree with Justice O'Connor's observation that where a confession is strongly reliable, that really ought to suggest that it should be admitted, that there is less of a confrontation problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.502" offset="11380119">But the second point, in addition to the videotape aspect, is the fact that the videotape really was almost like a summary of what had already gone on before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.172" offset="11410839">It was the third statement, and there were two spontaneous statements preceding the videotape.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.476" offset="11432050">There was the statement to the friend, the civilian, a lifelong friend, and then there was the spontaneous statement made to the police before the co-defendant was really under investigation as a target for this offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.617" offset="11480638">So, that distinguishes the station house situation that was present in Lee versus Illinois, a custodial situation where the co-defendant did not want to talk at all at first, wanted to think about the matter, and only agreed to talk after prompting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.793" offset="11533301">This was a spontaneous statement twice made both to civilians and to the police later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.864" offset="11557647">Third, there are no important differences between the confessions of the defendant and the co-defendant, and this is a dramatic distinction from Lee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.803" offset="11589412">First of all, in Lee the co-defendant's confession was the confession that supplied the element of premeditation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.540" offset="11616370">In this case, as I indicated and as the courts below found, both of the confessions agreed on the elements of the offense and both confessions established all of the elements of felony murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.764" offset="11665167">Similarly, in Lee versus Illinois there was a serious question concerning whether or not the defendant Lee was actually taking the blame for one of the two murders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.120" offset="11702679">In fact, there was indication that she was denying it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.756" offset="11713232">I see that my time is up, and I would simply ask this Court to affirm the conviction.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert S. Dean</label>
            <text syncTime="2901.278" offset="11751267">I would just like to address a few points that my opponents made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.766" offset="11777180">One is with regard to Justice O'Connor's question as to the more reliable the co-defendant's confession becomes the more there seems to be a Bruton problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.841" offset="11825559">The co-defendant's confession is much more reliable than the defendant's confession in this case in the sense that we know that it was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.781" offset="11861294">Furthermore, it's reliable evidence against the co-defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.816" offset="11873415">But in no way are we conceding that it has any reliability connecting petitioner to the crime, which would be the essential question in determining its admissibility against my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.057" offset="11926392">Also as to Justice White's question concerning, would there have been a procedural bar if respondent had first argued the substantive admissibility in the New York State Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.050" offset="11978323">In the Nieves case which is cited on footnote 2 of page 4 of my reply brief, the Court of Appeals repeated an oft-stated New York rule which is that an appellate court can affirm a judgment of conviction on an issue not raised by the prosecutor below, only if had the prosecutor raised the issue below, the other party could have put in, quote unquote, "no possible answer" to that issue when it had been raised below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.187" offset="12114891">I think that a simple... a quick reading of the Nieves cite would answer Justice White's question in that respondent would have definitely been barred in the New York Court of Appeals from raising that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.297" offset="12175391">That's on page 4 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.899" offset="12189706">Okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.951" offset="12197961">Just to emphasize a few more points, one is, if the question is one that should be determined prior... if the question of severance is one that should be determined prior to trial by the trial judge, merely subject to appellate review on harmless error analysis, there's no reason why the trial judge should not feel free to consider all factors as to whether confessions interlock, not just whether they interlock as to factual content.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.072" offset="12326483">All the other factors, how good a case the defendant could make as to voluntariness, as to whether it was made at all, as to whether it was true, all those factors could be taken into account by a trial judge before the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.249" offset="12383116">I'd just like to emphasize that our point is essentially this: that in determining whether the defendant's confession was actually uttered at all, they are naturally going to look to the co-defendant's confession in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.258" offset="12443198">And then even if they convince the jury, notwithstanding that, that the confession was never uttered, even then they have the same problem that was outlined in Bruton versus the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3084.881" offset="12485725">I suppose whether you want to consider all those other factors for purposes of determining whether they interlock, depends on what you think the purpose of interlocking is, and perhaps if the purpose is what the government suggests, that it will make it less likely that the jury will disobey its instructions, you may be right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.159" offset="12554793">But, what if the purpose of the interlocking requirement is simply not to say that the jury will be less likely to ignore its instructions, but to demonstrate that their ignoring of those instructions is less likely to be harmful?</text>

            <text syncTime="3116.501" offset="12612158">Then in that case all you really need is the interlocking facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3118.870" offset="12621667">--No, because in this case, assuming that the jury is not going to be able to obey the limiting instructions and that they are going to consider the co-defendant's confessions, and the question is really, does that damage the defendant's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.713" offset="12681017">That's the essence of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.348" offset="12695541">If they are not going to obey those limiting instructions, is the result going to be devastating to the defendant's case, and we submit it would be in this case because the co-defendant's confession is far more powerful and far more damaging to the defendant.</text>
