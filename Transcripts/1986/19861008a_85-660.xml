            <text syncTime="101.366" offset="552560">Factually, here is what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.733" offset="570010">The respondent, who is the criminal defendant in the case below, came up to a uniformed police officer in downtown Denver in August of 1983, and he told him that he had killed someone, and he wanted to tell the officer about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.410" offset="624763">The officer advised the defendant of his Miranda rights, which the defendant said he understood, and the officer later testified that he specifically advised the defendant as well that he didn't have to talk to him, but the defendant said it would be all right, that his conscience had been bothering him and he wanted to talk to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.455" offset="692890">The defendant then subsequently told the officer and other officers--</text>

            <text syncTime="162.903" offset="798738">So that you have one statement volunteered before custody, "I killed someone", and then you have Miranda warnings, and then some other statements after that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Nathan B. Coats</label>
            <text syncTime="173.176" offset="839803">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.961" offset="842938">The defendant then told that officer and other officers after the point of custody that he had killed a young Indian girl named Mary Ann Junta that he had been traveling with in November or December of the prior year, which would be 1982, and he told them also that he had killed her in a particular location in southwest Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.875" offset="934575">The police were able to determine pretty quickly that they... an unidentified female body had been discovered in April of 1983 and the defendant actually then took a couple of the officers out to the scene of the murder, showed them where he had committed the murder and how he had hidden the body and covered it with a mattress.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.705" offset="1009912">The defendant told his public defender, members of the public defender's staff shortly after that that he had come to Denver from Boston because voices told him to do that, so the defendant was sent to the Colorado State Hospital for a competency exam.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.481" offset="1076995">Based on the psychiatric report, he was found to be incompetent to proceed and he remained at that status for about six months until the same psychiatrist filed a new report saying that he then considered the defendant competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.890" offset="1130598">Now, at that point the defendant filed a motion to suppress all of his statements and to suppress all of the evidence derived from them because his confession was involuntary and because it was in violation of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.197" offset="1179917">All the facts that I have already mentioned came out at the suppression hearing, but in addition to those facts the psychiatrist testified at the suppression hearing that the defendant suffered from chronic schizophrenia, that he had something which the psychiatrist called command auditory halucinations, and that the defendant had told him that he had experienced the voice of God telling him to come back from Boston to Denver and to either confess or to kill himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.384" offset="1300603">The trial court granted the motion to suppress, but he did so in a way on narrow grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.705" offset="1325889">Despite the fact that he found that the the police had not done anything untoward or caused the confession, he nevertheless found that the defendant was incapable of making a voluntary confession for the reason that he felt compelled to follow the mandate of God, which the court found to be a product of his psychosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.333" offset="1392449">The Colorado Supreme Court affirmed, but in affirming it made a slight refinement on the suppression order which is very important for the review here.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.058" offset="1443336">It upheld suppression of the initial confession, the initial statement, the one that was unsolicited, as involuntary, as a violation of the due process old voluntariness standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.484" offset="1497044">However, it upheld suppression of all the statements after that point as... well, for the reason that as a result of the defendant's mental condition it felt that he was incapable of making an effective waiver of Miranda rights and therefore all subsequent statements were in violation of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.696" offset="1565902">Let me add one note about Colorado procedures here that might be helpful in explaining the nature of that ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.450" offset="1592861">In Colorado and, as I understand, some other jurisdictions in the country, because of the language in Miranda that says the prosecution will bear a heavy burden in establishing a waiver of Miranda rights, the burden on the people in Colorado is higher to establish a waiver of Miranda rights than it would be to establish the voluntariness of the confession itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.965" offset="1682931">In Colorado we use the formula by a preponderance of the evidence to establish the voluntariness of a confession, but by clear and convincing evidence to show an effective waiver of Miranda rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.987" offset="1727026">It seems to me that there are two things about these facts that make this case, and that make it different from the other cases that the Court has decided in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.426" offset="1772792">The first one, pretty obviously, is the fact that the initial confession was completely unsolicited.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.531" offset="1805184">The police did not know the defendant at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.150" offset="1815738">They had done nothing to him at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.268" offset="1824201">Let me say quickly that the reason that that is important, though, I do not think is because completely spontaneous or unsolicited confessions are very prevalent, and we don't know what to do with unsolicited confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.660" offset="1877700">As was the case here, and I think would almost always be the case, there may be... even where there is a spontaneous confession of this kind or spontaneous statement, there is going to be... the significant material that comes out will probably be in response to follow-up question of some kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.656" offset="1957739">So, probably the complete absence of police behavior is not the central point.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.727" offset="1978010">By the way, probably a larger class of confessions that will be affected very much by what is decided in this case in the area of statements made that have nothing to do with police practices probably would be statements made to private individuals, and what I am thinking of particularly are statements, statements made to private individuals in which a defendant subsequently comes forward and asserts that he was intoxicated, or for some other reason that he didn't voluntarily make that statement to a private individual and at that point seeks a Jackson v. Denno hearing to establish voluntariness.</text>

            <text syncTime="572.316" offset="2436302">The reason why I think this... the unsolicited nature of the confession is so important is that unlike the other cases in this area, in this whole voluntariness standard area, in which we always have to deal with the totality of circumstances, not having any police action whatsoever poses very clearly the question, the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.735" offset="2554062">Without regard to a particular balance there is simply no question here under the due process standard without some kind of causal relationship between police action and attempting to extract--</text>

            <text syncTime="756.668" offset="3173791">Well, I don't think Miranda does apply specifically to that part, and I think even Colorado made that distinction then, that the only question there is in some sense would this violate fundamental fairness?</text>

            <text syncTime="780.033" offset="3267205">I believe that there is no violation of fundamental fairness there, and this Court very recently... and let me say I think in a sense since Colorado decided this case with regard to the first issue, this Court in Miller versus Fenton has very strongly answered the very question that is before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.745" offset="3346095">The only difference is, it did not actually have a case or controversy dealing with this particular situation in which there was a confession without any police participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.552" offset="3385279">But in resolving the question whether the old due process standard is primarily a legal or a factual question, I think in Miller versus Fenton the Court said, to my way of thinking, very clearly that it always involves a legal consideration, and as a matter of fact in Miller versus Fenton the Court specifically addressed those cases and that theory relied on by the Colorado court, and rejected it, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.918" offset="3486738">It cited Culumbe for that group of cases, but it said that although at times in the past the Court seemed to have talked about voluntariness in terms of... in terms of psychological fact, that nevertheless always present, the thread running through all of those cases was this uniquely legal question, and that the primary consideration there was whether the police had behaved in a way in attempting to extract the confession that was compatible with our system of accusatorial justice, our accusatorial system of justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1239.324" offset="5104345">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, at the outset I would like to address myself to Justice Stevens' question about the trial court's finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.436" offset="5168815">I think the trial court did first say that respondent did not waive his right voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently, but then he went on to give reasons for that conclusion, and that is Pages 48 to 49 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.379" offset="5228583">And he says, the reason for that was that respondent, and I am quoting,</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.897" offset="5242689">"would do anything to follow the mandate of God to confess because his only alternative was to kill himself. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.568" offset="5261393">So it seems to us pretty clear from the reasons that the trial judge gave that what he was in fact finding was that the waiver was not voluntary, so we don't think that the Court has to overturn the trial judge's factual findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.892" offset="5318653">We think that the appropriate course is for the Court to find that that factor is just simply irrelevant in assessing the validity of the Miranda waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.064" offset="5351359">In considering the questions that are before the Court in this case, we think it is helpful to step back from the two specific constitutional provisions involved and consider for a moment the policies that are implicated by a claim that evidence should be suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.693" offset="5425860">The Court has stated many times the general rule that society has a right to every man's evidence, and it is recognized that the strong interests in law enforcement and the proper functioning of the truthseeking process favor placing all probative evidence before the trier of fact in a criminal proceeding, and so the question in this case and in any case where a defendant seeks to have particular evidence suppressed is whether that important general rule should give way because the omission of the evidence would contravene another important public policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2856.969" offset="11574980">In this case, as we have discussed, Mr. Connelly's volitional capacity was diminished, and therefore we would submit that the voluntary component was not compiled with.</text>

            <text syncTime="3110.029" offset="12587173">One quick point, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.715" offset="12593964">With regard to competence, we... because there is some kind of state action required under the old due process voluntariness standard, I don't think the question of competence has any bearing at all under that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.391" offset="12652688">With regard to the waiver of Miranda rights, though, the question obviously... competence, a finding of incompetence may very well indicate that the defendant could not... knowingly could not satisfy the cognitional dimension, but it does not necessarily do so, and in fact this case is a good example of a case in which for different policy reasons a defendant might be found incompetent to stand trial, in this case the doctor saying that he could... was passing in and out of psychoses and he wasn't sure that he could consistently assist his counsel over a continuous period of time, and yet at the same time the psychiatrist was able to find that his cognitional abilities were not at all impaired with regard to this particular waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.885" offset="12818618">So finding that someone is incompetent to stand trial seems to me to be a different standard and does not necessarily indicate that he could not make a waiver of any constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.241" offset="12856025">I have nothing else, Your Honor, unless there are any questions.</text>
