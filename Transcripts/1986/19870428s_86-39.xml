            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="91790">The other case, Burlington Northern Railroad versus Brotherhood began as a dispute over renewal of a collective bargaining agreement between a small railroad in Maine and some of its employees and shortly expanded to picketing and threats of strike activity at railroad facilities all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.884" offset="195235">A Federal District Court then enjoined the picketing of any railroads other than those involved in the primary dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.454" offset="225537">The question we must decide is whether the prohibition of the Norris-LaGuardia Act that bars Federal Courts from issuing injunctions against secondary activity growing out of any labor dispute stripped the Federal Court of jurisdiction to issue the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.820" offset="298993">The Court of Appeals held that District Court has no jurisdiction to enter an injunction by enforcing that statute and reversed the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.640" offset="338281">We agree with the Court of Appeals and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.428" offset="357403">We hold, for the reasons stated in the opinion filed by the Clerk that the Federal Court does not have jurisdiction to enjoin secondary picketing in railway labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.307" offset="400975">The decision is unanimous.</text>
