            <text syncTime="17.878" offset="220877">The petitioning public housing tenants in this case and the Roanoke Housing Authority agree on one critical point of the case: Where a Section 1983 plaintiff has a substantive right under federal law, we are in agreement that there arises a presumption that Congress intended for a private enforcement action to be possible rather than precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.910" offset="317008">The major issue before the Court is how that presumption operates.</text>

            <text syncTime="47.231" offset="338324">Mr. Woodward, from what you say I gather that's a somewhat different test than the test for an implied cause of action under a federal statute?</text>

            <label>Mr. Henry L. Woodward</label>
            <text syncTime="56.087" offset="373746">We believe that it is, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.287" offset="378552">It has some elements in common, but I believe that the experience of the Fourth Circuit in trying to address the preclusion inquiry here shows that the traditional Cort versus Ash four-step approach is not really going to serve the express Congressional purposes of 1983 adequately.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="75.881" offset="452844">And why do you say that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Henry L. Woodward</label>
            <text syncTime="77.183" offset="458069">Well, looking specifically at the pieces of the Cort versus Ash test, some of them just don't seem to fit very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.237" offset="490252">The first, which has to do with identifying a substantive right really, is in the 1983 context presumed, if we've gotten that far, by the Pennhurst sort of analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.830" offset="540720">If there is no substantive right, then we don't get to the preclusion question.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.116" offset="557857">So that part of the traditional four-part test for the implied right is not directly a part of the preclusion inquiry for 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.804" offset="596622">The other piece that just doesn't fit very well with the nature and purpose of 1983 is perhaps the fourth step of the Cort versus Ash test, that which would have us look to whether the matter is one in which state law has something to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.433" offset="659107">And that doesn't fit very well because of the traditional federalism concerns of Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.170" offset="686066">It has traditionally been viewed by this Court as a supplemental remedy to whatever the state may provide.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="139.491" offset="707277">Certainly it is as a practical matter kind of awkward to have two different tests for such closely related things, isn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="henry_l_woodward" startTime="146.977" stopTime="203.849">
            <label>Mr. Henry L. Woodward</label>
            <text syncTime="146.977" offset="737266">Well, there is some awkwardness.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.012" offset="745416">On the other hand, unless some specific method is found of addressing the particular nature of Section 1983, then the demands of that statute and the intent of Congress expressed in that statute are just not likely to be recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.689" offset="804139">Now, we concede that there is some similarity in sort of the middle and the core tests of the implied rights inquiry, that is the inquiry into Congressional intent, and the Section 1983 inquiry about preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.866" offset="864848">But there is a difference of where they're coming from as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.751" offset="880312">The implied rights inquiry is really traditionally applied in the context of a plaintiff trying to meet a burden of establishing Congressional intent, from whatever evidence is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.177" offset="930049">In the 1983 context, the Congressional intent that you start with is the expressed intent, express intent in 1983 itself.</text>

            <label>Mr. Henry L. Woodward</label>
            <text syncTime="211.087" offset="993684">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.720" offset="996191">It is defendant-specific, in that sense, and it is only in that context that this area of examination of Congressional intent would be different from the implied rights inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.061" offset="1041644">The nature of Section 1983 is such that the sort of evidence that will suffice to justify preclusion has to be substantially greater than that which would defeat a plaintiff attempting to establish an implied right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.824" offset="1128684">And the reason for that is that there is, after all, in 1983 that express intent that private parties have that remedy against that certain class of defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.782" offset="1168495">And so it should not be, that express grant of authority to proceed, should not be really impeachable, except by equally strong evidence.</text>

            <label>Mr. Henry L. Woodward</label>
            <text syncTime="267.506" offset="1219382">That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.306" offset="1222621">We would concede that you have to identify a right secured by the Constitution and laws, as Section 1983 requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.629" offset="1255848">But I think that the chief problem in this case was not the identification of a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.766" offset="1276433">The Fourth Circuit may have been a little reluctant about it and they never really examined the Brooke amendment, but they seem to concede that there was a right involved there and to focus instead on the enforceability.</text>

            <text syncTime="303.863" offset="1364831">He doesn't appear to challenge that the Brooke amendment itself establishes some rights in tenants.</text>

            <text syncTime="309.316" offset="1386670">Well, I think it does, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.452" offset="1395133">It doesn't appear expressly in the Brooke amendment, but the Brooke amendment does limit the portion of tenant income that can be applied to rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.558" offset="1427630">What you have to do, since that doesn't say what you get for your rent, it only says how much rent you pay, you have to look elsewhere in the statute to see what you get for the rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.664" offset="1460022">And the elsewhere that we would recommend is the definitional part of what was originally 1437(a), that says--</text>

          <turn speaker="henry_l_woodward" startTime="340.055" stopTime="796.567">
            <label>Mr. Henry L. Woodward</label>
            <text syncTime="340.055" offset="1509550">We don't have any reservations about reading that together with the statute, but we think that there is adequate strength in the statute itself if we had to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.577" offset="1543613">This is not a case where we have to separate the regulation and the statute, because they are closely tied.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.195" offset="1562108">But I'm trying to point out that there is in 1437(a) a definition of low income housing that includes not only the dwelling, but also embracing the necessary appurtenances thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.753" offset="1612368">Now, both before and after Congress passed the Brooke amendment HUD's regulations interpreted specifically or prescribed specifically what tenants were supposed to get for their rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.395" offset="1654895">And in those regulations, HUD said not only the dwelling, but also the equipment that's included in the dwelling, necessary services, and reasonable amounts of utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.751" offset="1692407">That was the standard before and after the Brooke amendment was adopted, and that was the standard that the Housing Authority and the tenants and HUD and everybody agreed on.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.856" offset="1724799">So that when the Brooke amendment was adopted, that limitation of 25 percent, now up to 30 percent, of family income that could be charged was to include those things which the Housing Act had previously and was in the future to contemplate being provided in exchange for rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.353" offset="1806719">It should be no mystery that the Brooke amendment itself doesn't say utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.972" offset="1825213">The Brooke amendment doesn't attempt to say what's covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.507" offset="1835349">It only says what the tenant pays, and what he gets is clear from the other part of the statute and from the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.112" offset="1865755">Now, it was only in 1980 that HUD went beyond its previous approach of non-mandatory guidelines to establish a firm and binding and mandatory regulation that explained how utilities allowances were to be calculated.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.074" offset="1933674">And it did so in no uncertain terms, and it made a... it mandated that the housing authorities receiving public housing subsidies begin to implement that regulation immediately, and set an outside deadline of 120 days for doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.101" offset="2001801">The regulation provided both procedural steps to be followed in calculating the allowances and it set a substantive standard, the intent being that not more than ten percent of the tenants in a given size of housing unit should have to pay anything more than their 25 percent maximum of income rent in order to enjoy the utilities allowance established.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.401" offset="2102947">When that happened, the Housing Authority was duly notified by HUD, as the record shows, and told to implement it not later than 120 days from the date of promulgation, and the Housing Authority simply refused to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.244" offset="2162297">The Housing Authority continued to use an allowance of utilities which was so low that they could no longer explain how it was calculated.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.766" offset="2192390">And instead of it providing adequately for 90 percent of the tenants, it seems to have resulted in the charging of additional surcharges to 90 to 100 percent of the tenants in most of the sizes of apartments, for most of the quarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.757" offset="2248397">This state of affairs continued even after the 120 day deadline had passed, even after tenant demands had been made for recalculation, even after the filing of this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.149" offset="2293955">So there is simply no question that the Housing Authority in this case simply refused to follow the mandate of HUD.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.405" offset="2323003">Now, the tenants complained in the district court that this was illegal and they sued to get their money back that had been collected in excess of their maximum Brooke rent during the period in which these surcharges were in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.680" offset="2392070">They sued under both 1983 and under their leases with the Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.318" offset="2410670">The Fourth Circuit, focusing chiefly on the 1983 question, found that Congress had intended to preclude such private actions for enforcement, notwithstanding the specificity with which the Brooke amendment identifies the tenants as the beneficiaries, in fact the sole beneficiaries, of the rent limit in that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.148" offset="2497919">And the way in which the question was approached I think suggests the weakness of trying to apply uniformly a Cort versus Ash sort of inquiry, because it led to what is definitely a wrong conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.543" offset="2559568">Despite the fact that in this context there is no Congressional express preclusion of private suits... there is nothing in the statute, there is nothing in the legislative history that says private parties may not sue... and despite the absence of any express private remedy effective in these circumstances, such as was present in the Middlesex County Sewerage Authority versus National Sea Clammers case, the Fourth Circuit reached out to find from the very, very modest evidence of the granting of administrative authority to HUD over this program that that represented Congressional intent to preclude a Section 1983 remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.638" offset="2735946">Now, when you examine that evidence you have to conclude that this is fairly modest administrative authority even relative to other federal grant programs, such as the AFDC program for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.546" offset="2783489">It does not extend, according to HUD itself and to the wording of the statute, to withdrawal of operating subsidies from a noncomplying housing authority, except in very narrow circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.688" offset="2836152">The administrative authority of HUD operates only through the annual contributions contract, and that section of the United States Housing Act which specifies what is to be enforced through the annual contributions contract does not even specify the Brooke amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.167" offset="2913997">The Brooke amendment occurs in a different portion of the Act, suggesting that that's not one of the explicit things to which the contributions contract must be addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.290" offset="2954539">It is also the case that HUD itself apparently does not believe it has the enforcement authority that the Fourth Circuit ascribes to it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.796" offset="2992573">While we believe that HUD may be overreading the extent of its lack of power here, HUD has taken the position in several cases which are cited in our brief that it itself has no authority to enforce the Brooke amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.507" offset="3055372">That may be extreme, but it certainly appears to be the case that it was not given anywhere in the Act or in its administrative authority over housing authorities an exclusive sort of right to enforce the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1190.887" offset="4912887">The implications of the way the Fourth Circuit has treated this, of course, are substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.339" offset="4930755">If with this very modest grant of administrative authority, whether you read it as the statute says or the way HUD reads it... either way, it's a fairly modest grant of administrative authority and what we believe is a very clearly vested sort of right in the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.450" offset="4995120">If that combination in this case presents preclusion problems, then there will be preclusion problems or perhaps an insurmountable preclusion barrier in virtually any case in which an individual tries to vindicate their individual rights in a grant program, without regard to how specifically, how concretely, or how strongly Congress in the program statute vested the individual rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1350.941" offset="5553096">I think we're tied in this case to the very specific grant of substantive right which the Brooke amendment represents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.095" offset="5577755">Now, the Fourth Circuit at least has held that other provisions of the Housing Authority... I mean, I'm sorry, of the Housing Act... don't go so far and don't grant a substantive right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.236" offset="5618297">Without conceding that those decisions are correct, we recognize that the case... the issue must be addressed in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.323" offset="5642644">It will not follow from a holding that the tenants may vindicate their Brooke amendment rights that any tenant may vindicate any right that he asserts against a housing authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="1437.666" offset="5900002">Since the Brooke amendment was passed in 1969, it has widely been assumed that tenants may sue under the Brooke amendment to enforce the rental limitation in that amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1569.734" offset="6428302">The end of the case as presented to this Court is an end that we do not believe was anticipated by Congress in 1937, nor was it anticipated through the course of the legislative history of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.643" offset="6483891">Mr. Justice Powell has noted the question of whether or not an individual tenant can bring a complaint over other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.380" offset="6510849">Justice Scalia has rightly questioned whether the utilities might not be working and you might have a right to the money but not the utility to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.420" offset="6547003">We would submit to you that the regulations of HUD in this instance are identical to the Brooke amendment utility regulations, whether you view them from the question of maintenance and repair of the facilities, the ventilation, the plumbing, the heating, the electrical, or whether you view then merely from the narrow attempt of Petitioners to achieve utilities in the form of electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.701" offset="6640208">Please allow me to be more specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.137" offset="6649925">24 CFR 966 had a precursor at 24 CFR 866 and had a precursor at the HUD handbook.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.909" offset="6689004">In each and every one of those instances, HUD has uniformly held that housing authorities, in order to be able to operate under the scheme envisioned by Congress in 1937, a scheme envisioning a lease and a relationship of landlord-tenant sorts of things, that under those provisions the PHA could charge maintenance for everything over ordinary wear and tear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.012" offset="6805406">That is by regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.630" offset="6815855">Moreover, they may charge late charges, they may charge for security deposits, they may also, incidentally... and this is true prior to the Brooke amendment... charge for excess utilities, particularly where those utilities are incurred through the use of major tenant-supplied appliances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.509" offset="6883355">Congress has embodied those regulations in the very same statute upon which Petitioners rely in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.698" offset="6916165">Petitioners rely under what is commonly known now as the Brooke amendment, found at Section 1437a(a) of the Act, previously found at Section 1402, and embodied in the Housing Act in one form or another as a definition of low rent housing, which I might transfer into a definition of what you get for your dollar, ever since 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.528" offset="7003414">In 1983 the Congress, realizing that HUD was about to repeal its regulations pertaining to the maintenance of the lease action, amended the Act at 1437L.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.371" offset="7062869">And interestingly and curiously enough, L happens to coincide with "lease".</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.775" offset="7084498">1437L of the Act says that every PHA lease shall have a reasonable term, shall provide for decent, safe, and sanitary housing, shall provide for a time for eviction and notice of cause for eviction, things which HUD had before regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.688" offset="7168090">Now Congress, recognizing that they were an essential part of that program enacted in 1937 and amended in 1947, '49, '59, '69, '74, and through the course then of the eighties in '81 and '83, Congress had linched its entire scheme of landlord-tenant proceedings on a lease, a lease which they had now, realizing that HUD might back away from the regulations, Congress enacted an amendment which said, no, you may not do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.742" offset="7300374">And so if it can be said that the Brooke amendment limit to rent under 1437a(a) and the regulations under 24 CFR 865, now 965, if these rise to a right or to a remedy, then so does every term of every lease in every PHA, for every one of millions of families in this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="2664.369" offset="10806843">But nevertheless, that's the Petitioners' point, that they'll get the money from HUD; that if I win I'll just get less subsidy or less money from the tenant... or more money from the tenant and less subsidy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2981.993" offset="12077334">And I think that that's outside of the ambit of what the Congress intended when it set up a virtually unique situation 50 years ago with a lease arrangement with a landlord-tenant relationship, recognizing that they were dealing in leaseholds.</text>

            <text syncTime="3058.143" offset="12381922">At that point a panel is appointed, and I frankly can't recall right now how it is constituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.730" offset="12404283">But it encompasses not only management representatives, but tenant representatives.</text>

            <text syncTime="3071.568" offset="12435630">There is opportunity to be heard, to be represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.604" offset="12447750">Indeed, that has happened as recently as a few weeks ago over a twelve dollar claim with which I am familiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.274" offset="12470425">And those panel members sit and hear a full-fledged discussion of whether or not something has happened according to the way it ought, according to the lease, according to the other regulations of the Housing Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.451" offset="12535208">It terminates at that point, although it is enforceable in my view in state court because the grievance procedure itself is a part of that same lease at section 13.</text>

            <text syncTime="3172.701" offset="12840110">If I may accept the invitation of Justice Stevens to expand a little bit beyond the record with regard to the screen door cases, I would like to say that if those cases are brought with regard to the Housing Authority in Roanoke we would probably be bringing them, and in fact there are very few.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.544" offset="12899564">What happens in fact is that the grievance mechanism does work in individual cases to some extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.764" offset="12920462">It's not a marvelous thing, but if the problem of the tenant is with the question of who kicked in the screen door and who should pay for it, the grievance mechanism is a way to address that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.470" offset="12959228">What the grievance mechanism is specifically not available for, according to HUD and in the regulations it promulgated to implement it, is for challenges to the policy of the Housing Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.511" offset="13003427">And that makes some sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.678" offset="13008025">If the problem is a project-wide or authority-wide policy problem with the Housing Authority, then taking it to a panel is not only impractical but it's specifically contrary to the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.188" offset="13066121">And it certainly never gets beyond the panel in that mechanism to HUD itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.240" offset="13082317">So in fact, some matters are specifically appropriate for grievance mechanisms and some aren't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.662" offset="13108022">What makes this case particularly a federal case is that the Brooke amendment, as the Sixth Circuit has recognized, is the backbone of the public housing program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.201" offset="13150131">It just isn't right for a state court to be making critical determinations of what the Brooke amendment means and how it affects 1100 families in public housing in Roanoke as a matter of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.676" offset="13200077">And that is I think the ultimate reason this is a federal case.</text>
