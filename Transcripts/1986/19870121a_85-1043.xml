            <label>Mr. John E. Nolan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="13.120" offset="197290">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.866" offset="228219">May it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="22.663" offset="235429">This case involves the issue of federal preemption of state common law claims of general application in the context of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.175" offset="285479">The real significance of the case is whether or not the federal system of regulation of employee benefit plans, as governed by ERISA, will now be largely supplanted by the varying state laws that Congress intended ERISA to replace.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.150" offset="369385">Congress believed, and believes, that there are great advantages to ERISA, that those advantages admittedly do not include jury trials, punitive damages, consequential damages, de novo review of claims, decisions and other features that may be available from time to time under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.781" offset="471889">If such state remedies are available, as the Court of Appeals opinion holds, then ERISA will effectively be nullified for all insured plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.666" offset="523403">Now, this is more than 80 percent of the health benefit plans in the United States, the vast majority of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.632" offset="555272">We argue that Congress could never have intended this result and expressly provided against it in ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.251" offset="593829">The focus of this case is an employee benefit plan governed by ERISA in its claims procedure as provided in Section 503 of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.169" offset="645447">Pilot Life, the petitioner in this case, is the named fiduciary for that plan as provided in ERISA and as designated in the plan itself, and Pilot Life has full responsibility for all claims decisions and claims administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.706" offset="727576">Mr. Dedeaux, the respondent here is a participant in that plan and his claim for benefits was denied by Pilot Life.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.359" offset="770207">When it was denied, Mr. Dedeaux did not avail himself of the statutorily-mandated claims review procedure in ERISA, in Section 503.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.261" offset="821825">Instead, he filed suit in a Federal District Court in Mississippi, diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.946" offset="848575">He claimed tortious breach of contract, fraud, and breach of fiduciary relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.819" offset="880026">He sought disability benefits, consequential damages for mental and emotional distress in the amount of $250,000, and punitive damages in the amount of $500,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.358" offset="942198">There was a demand of jury trial, no mention of ERISA in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.590" offset="967171">The District Court granted summary judgment for defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.041" offset="988905">It held that ERISA provided the exclusive remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.446" offset="1010534">The Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit reversed, holding that Mr. Dedeaux's state common law claims of general application were preserved by the so-called insurance saving clause of ERISA which keeps from preemption the state laws that regulate insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.280" offset="1101858">Now we say that that decision is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.090" offset="1117114">The Congress in enacting ERISA sought to preempt all of the state law that came within the sphere of the statute, that the saving clause is not applicable to state laws like this because they don't regulate insurance and that, in any event, it was plain that Congress sought to prevent the direct application of any state law to an employee benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.188" offset="1241561">In cases like this which involve federal preemption of state law, this Court has said, as it did most recently in California Federal v. Garrett, decided last week, that its sole task is to ascertain the intent of Congress, and to do that it looks at the language and the legislative history, and the structure and purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.708" offset="1363605">The key language here is found in Section 514 of ERISA, it's entitled, "Effect on Other Laws".</text>
            <text syncTime="314.374" offset="1402266">Section 514(a), is a sweeping, express provision for preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.949" offset="1432568">It says that ERISA supersedes any and all state laws that may now, or hereafter, relate to any employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.414" offset="1482410">It's followed in 514(b), by the so-called saving clause, which provides that nothing in ERISA shall exempt any person from any law of any state that regulates insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.907" offset="1552418">And that clause is immediately followed and modified by the so-called "deemer clause" which provides that no employee benefit plan shall be deemed to be an insurance company or engaged in insurance for purposes of any state law purporting to regulate insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.569" offset="1639040">Now there are two things to notice about the language in 514.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.599" offset="1659207">The first is that when Congress uses the term, "state law that regulates insurance", it is using a term of art and in this instance one that has acquired very specific meaning through years of interpretation under the McCarran-Ferguson Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.779" offset="1731932">The second is that Congress very plainly showed its purpose to prevent any direct regulation of employee benefit plans by state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.399" offset="1782400">That was the finding of this Court in the case of Metropolitan Life v. Massachusetts, decided a couple of years ago, where the Court said that the purpose of the deemer clause is to take out of the operation of the saving clause any state laws that apply directly to an employee benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.577" offset="1887099">These state common law claims not only apply directly to the employee benefit plan, but they clash directly with the key provision of ERISA with the provisions dealing with fiduciary responsibility, claims review, civil enforcement remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.411" offset="1970377">These are the core functions of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.614" offset="1979259">They go to the very heart of ERISA regulation and that's why Congress provided that they couldn't be regulated by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.735" offset="2019696">The legislative history of ERISA plainly confirms the intent of Congress, that the fiduciary standards of ERISA, govern the entire claims administration process.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.744" offset="2083749">That was the finding of this Court in Mass. Mutual v. Russell, decided also a couple of years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.569" offset="2115096">It's in the opinion of the Court and it's very expressly in Justice Brennan's concurring opinion as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.956" offset="2148637">Congress intended that ERISA provide a uniform source of law for evaluating fiduciary standards, that that law would apply all over the United States, and that it would provide standards for fiduciary and that the federal courts would be used exclusively for cases of--</text>

            <text syncTime="1432.672" offset="5875474">It was referred to and relied on by this Court in the Metropolitan Life case and it goes directly to that point and the report says on the one hand it was clear that the plans subject to ERISA needed to be freed of the possibility of state regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1930.493" offset="7866736">So, we have to know whether the deemer clause extends to a trust established under a plan, whether or not the trustee is the insurance company that happens to be serving to insure that ERISA plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.331" offset="7938103">And if anything at all seems clear from the history, the congressional and legislative history, of ERISA, it would seem to be that remedies provided for employees covered by an ERISA plan, whether insured or not, are limited to those spelled out in the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.961" offset="8036637">And so I think there a very logical argument can be made and is being made that the deemer clause backs out of the savings clause at least the remedies provided for an insured employee.</text>
