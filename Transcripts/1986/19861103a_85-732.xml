            <text syncTime="11.272" offset="191116">You may proceed when you're ready, Mr. Rasenberger.</text>

          <turn speaker="raymond_j_rasenberger" startTime="15.093" stopTime="263.650">
            <label>Mr. Raymond J. Rasenberger</label>
            <text syncTime="15.093" offset="206372">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="20.562" offset="228314">The issue in this case is whether the South Dakota Airline flight property tax discriminates against airlines in violation of 49 U.S.C. 1513(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="35.506" offset="288083">That section in a nutshell prohibits states from assessing or from taxing air carrier property at a higher rate than commercial and industrial property in the same jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.730" offset="336984">Now, the South Dakota Supreme Court has held that there was no violation of the statute, even though almost no other property, personal property in South Dakota, is taxed except the property of airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.073" offset="398319">Indeed, property that is not taxed includes aircraft that's privately owned, it includes corporate aircraft, it includes aircraft used in charter services, it includes even aircraft used in interstate air service.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.849" offset="461431">Only the aircraft of interstate airlines or those in foreign commerce is taxed in South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.320" offset="487345">And needless to say, no competing modes of transportation are taxed insofar as their personal property is concerned, such as buses or taxis or rental cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.526" offset="528096">Now, the state doesn't deny that its system is discriminatory and the state agrees, as I understand them, that the purpose of 1513(d) is to prevent discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.750" offset="573026">And the state also admits that, if it taxed other commercial and industrial property in the state, the assessment ratios and the tax rates could not be any lower for that property than for air carrier property.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.410" offset="631645">But the state says the kind of discrimination it's practicing in this case is permitted by the statute because it's exempting all other property from taxation, rather than taxing it at a lower rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.384" offset="687547">Now, the South Dakota court has reached that conclusion based on a reading of 1513(d) which it says is clear and unambiguous, so clear and unambiguous, apparently, there was no need to even dwell upon the purpose of Congress in enacting 1513(d), no need to even take a glance at the legislative history of 1513(d), which the court did not do, so clear apparently no need to even consider an opinion of the North Dakota Supreme Court eight months earlier which reached exactly the opposite conclusion as to the meaning of the statute on virtually the same facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.627" offset="856507">North Dakota had an airline flight property tax and North Dakota exempted other property.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.615" offset="876465">And the North Dakota court, in holding that the statute had been violated, noted that it was its duty to avoid what it called ludicrous and absurd results.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.922" offset="925679">Now, the language that South Dakota finds to be so clear and unambiguous includes this key phrase:</text>
            <text syncTime="205.294" offset="967162">"subject to a property tax levy. "</text>
            <text syncTime="208.063" offset="978238">That phrase appears in the definition of commercial and industrial property, and that's the comparison class for purposes of determining whether there is discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.336" offset="1015332">1513(d) says roughly this: you shall not assess air carrier property at a higher percentage of true value than other commercial and industrial property; second, you shall not tax air carrier property at a higher rate than other commercial and industrial property.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.547" offset="1088265">And commercial and industrial property is defined in the statute, with few exceptions, as property devoted to a commercial and industrial use and subject to a property tax levy, and those are the key words.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.509" offset="1152109">And South Dakota says that means, that definition means, property that's being put to a commercial and industrial use and is being taxes, as distinguished from capable of being taxed.</text>

            <text syncTime="300.554" offset="1348236">I don't know whether it's got anything to do with the tax here or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.256" offset="1359103">In any case, the short of it is that South Dakota says, since there is no property being taxed in the state, personal property, there is no property in the comparison class, hence there's no violation of 1513(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="318.265" offset="1419080">Now, the first problem we have with that analysis is the idea that the words</text>

            <text syncTime="326.669" offset="1452726">are all that clear and unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.204" offset="1458891">I mean, the words "subject to", as we all know, are often used to refer to things that could happen as well as things that have happened, like in the phrase</text>

            <text syncTime="377.517" offset="1656063">As you look at the legislative history, you'll see that the kind of precision that you're suggesting went into the fixing of those words is lacking everywhere else in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.873" offset="1701516">And I suggest that it just wasn't that deliberate a choice as between "a" or not using the letter "a".</text>

            <text syncTime="1209.067" offset="4982287">So there's a very good reason why, in light of that feeling on Congress' part, it would not have put in the statute that catch-all clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1227.029" offset="5054176">But in addition, the airlines already had protection against gross receipts taxes in 1315(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.016" offset="5078104">So the reason the railroads needed that blanket provision was not applicable to the airlines, and in any case the airlines themselves did not seek that provision when the proposed the bill to Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="1682.583" offset="6876373">We are not talking here today about a new tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.035" offset="6890166">The tax that South Dakota imposes on airlines has been in place since 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.939" offset="6913781">And since 1961, the state of South Dakota has only taxed aircraft, and I want to make that clear to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.128" offset="6950561">We don't tax the trucks that service the airplanes, we don't tax whatever equipment they have in their office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.115" offset="6974489">We only tax the airframes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.650" offset="6984625">Where did the South Dakota tax come from?</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.102" offset="6994447">It came from and can best be explained, I think, from a decision of this Court, Braniff Airlines versus the Nebraska State Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.042" offset="7030182">If you will harken back to that case, you will find our tax scheme, wherein we use a ratio of how much the airplane is actually used in South Dakota, together with revenue miles and other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.884" offset="7089532">That scheme of taxation was approved by this Court and Justice Reed wrote that it was a proper tax on interstate commerce at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.240" offset="7131015">Since 1961, although other business and commercial property paid personal property taxes in South Dakota, up until 1979 the airlines did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.065" offset="7178244">When we imposed this tax on the airframes, the aircraft themselves, we specifically exempted airline companies from other taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.539" offset="7220145">And I think my colleague misspoke himself when he said private aircraft is not subject to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.592" offset="7244386">As an aircraft owner, I can tell you it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.544" offset="7256194">If you live in South Dakota and you buy an airplane, you pay a four percent use tax on the purchase price of the airplane.</text>

            <text syncTime="1802.410" offset="7355668">What I'm saying is we have a statute that specifically exempts those businesses in interstate commerce, and so I wanted to make clear that this tax was impacted by the passage in 1982 of the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.519" offset="7420138">But it is not as if we passed the tax afterward.</text>

            <text syncTime="1823.073" offset="7438319">And we all recognize that airlines are a unique business.</text>

            <text syncTime="1829.691" offset="7464755">They're not like railroads, which have miles and miles of real estate in the state which is taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.547" offset="7492236">So when South Dakota took off or repealed the personal property tax on other commercial and business property, the personal property side of it... there are other taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.521" offset="7540092">The history of our state will reveal at that time we were broadening the sale tax and the use tax to other businesses, meanwhile repealing the personal property tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1857.710" offset="7576873">Well, but General Meierhenry, certainly the legislative history of this Act shows a legislative intent to prevent the state from taxing airlines or, in the case of railroads, railroads for ad valorem property tax purposes at a higher rate and putting them in a separate classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.172" offset="7654718">And that's the thrust of the bill, and your argument certainly goes counter to that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1886.195" offset="7690767">Well, the thrust of the legislation, if I could be so bold as to put it in a sentence, was not to discriminate against interstate commerce and not to penalize in any way companies, like airlines, that operate interstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.572" offset="7756282">And we are talking here today about a tax that raises totally, from all the airlines in the state of South Dakota, about $200,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.762" offset="7793062">The result if this particular tax is struck down is we will collect zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.666" offset="7812706">Now, if we collect zero I think we would all agree that we are not harming the airlines, if we collect no tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1940.747" offset="7909046">But because the state charges zero ad valorem property taxes against private aircraft and other property, the result you argue for is that the tax stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.855" offset="7961500">And it just is kind of an odd result.</text>

            <text syncTime="1956.624" offset="7972576">Well, I follow through in 1315(d), where it makes clear that states can have property taxes on interstate carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.849" offset="8013431">It also says they can have net income taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1972.549" offset="8036210">We chose not to do that, because it is most fair, as our brief points out, and we try to be fair to airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.620" offset="8060556">What the airlines say is that, because we have attempted to be fair to the airlines and we have arranged a scheme that was in effect 25 years unchallenged, that this Congressional legislation immediately struck it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.498" offset="8132027">But yet, what are the meaning... when they define "subject to a property tax", can we assume, as courts have in other cases, that Congress was aware of our tax?</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.341" offset="8183436">After all, Justice O'Connor, we followed the model that was put into effect, recognized by this Court, by the then Civil Aeronautics Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="2121.146" offset="8630652">When we continued this tax, we took off the personal property totally, and so it remained only centrally assessed, as are utilities, railroads, and other factors.</text>

            <text syncTime="2348.757" offset="9541072">So what they pay rent for is the facility, the building, the runways, all these things, to operate their business.</text>

            <text syncTime="2367.052" offset="9614215">They come and go out of our state, and we have this huge facility waiting to serve their business purpose, which they now can load all their equipment up on the last plane out of town and we as a state have nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.228" offset="9670953">So if you go back and look at our tax structure, it's even more fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.596" offset="9684432">It's only when they do business in our state that they pay the tax, according to the amount of business they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.167" offset="9710659">And so the whole purpose of the RRRR Act was to stop discrimination, and we have taken note of that in our state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.856" offset="9745454">And we put into our brief and attempted to show this Court that as a state we have ceased the discriminatory practices that many states have used against interstate carriers, and that's why those cases are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.497" offset="9796027">Our Supreme Court has told the state and the counties and everybody that taxes, we must be fair.</text>

            <text syncTime="2711.533" offset="10992122">There just isn't any by statutory definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.152" offset="11002675">And therefore, the ratio of the true value of that property, whatever it may be, to the assessed value, is zero.</text>

            <text syncTime="3073.529" offset="12440141">We had always taxed airlines and we do today the same as we did, only on their aircraft, not on their personal property.</text>

            <text syncTime="3090.872" offset="12509523">They were never part of the personal property tax levy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.192" offset="12522793">They were part of the other type of tax that we had imposed upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.810" offset="12541288">So the fact that we have no commercial or industrial personal property today, we didn't in 1961 or '71... or I should say, they didn't pay any personal property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.618" offset="12592488">So when we eliminated the personal property tax levy, it really never affected the airlines.</text>

            <text syncTime="3143.523" offset="12720070">Just as today the personal property of railroads is not taxable in South Dakota, just their real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.160" offset="12746714">And I think it's important in construing the statute to look at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.397" offset="12767612">In closing, I would only like to say that, as was pointed out by this Court, we have frequently reiterated that the commerce clause does not immunize interstate instrumentalities from all state taxation, but that such commerce may be required to pay a non-discriminatory share of the tax burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.895" offset="12845562">We believe that our South Dakota tax is a non-discriminatory share of the tax burden, and it fits within 1513 as a fair and equitable way to collect a very, very small share of the tax burden from the airlines in South Dakota.</text>

            <text syncTime="3254.344" offset="13163420">The other final point is, remember that this is not just South Dakota that's involved or just these airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.913" offset="13185676">We're talking about a proposition that would have broad applicability to a lot of states which don't have personal property taxes, which could imposes taxes on airlines just as South Dakota did, where we have a lot more aircraft and a lot more train rolling stock and buses, and where a lot more money than $200,000 could be involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.542" offset="13256207">And if those states were to do that on invitation of the Court in the decision in this case, we would basically simply create exactly the kind of property tax discrimination that this whole project, these three pieces of legislation, were designed to eliminate at the time and in conjunction with, as we know, the carriers were being deregulated by the Congress.</text>
