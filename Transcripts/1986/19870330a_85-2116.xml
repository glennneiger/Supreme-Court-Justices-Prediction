            <text syncTime="12.840" offset="195287">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.334" offset="213260">Petitioner in this case requested extradition of Mr. Ronald Calder, who was charged with murder and attempted murder, and is a fugitive from the courts of justice in the courts of Puerto Rico, and had fled to Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.797" offset="311167">The Governor of Iowa denied extradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.270" offset="324959">The commonwealth filed a complaint in the District Court for the Southern District of Iowa seeking a writ of mandamus directing the Governor to extradite Calder.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.000" offset="391937">The writ was refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.813" offset="399147">The Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.305" offset="413149">The case is here on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.327" offset="425270">The issue is whether or not the Federal courts have power to order the governor of a state to extradite a fugitive from justice in the courts of Puerto Rico who has been accused of murder and attempted murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.334" offset="521296">There is no dispute in this case that the extradition request made by Puerto Rico fully complies with all statutory and constitutional requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.583" offset="586288">There is no dispute, either, that the duty of the Governor of Iowa to extradite Mr. Calder is an absolute duty, both mandatory and ministerial, under the Constitution and the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.067" offset="676150">All that is at issue here is whether the court, the Federal court, may command the governor to obey that duty, or whether the governor may violate it with impunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.008" offset="747934">Now the facts are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.713" offset="766742">Mr. Ronald Calder on... in 1981 drover his car into a married couple in a parking lot of a grocery store in Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.476" offset="837795">The husband was injured but survived.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.100" offset="868306">His pregnant wife was killed, as well as her unborn child.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.925" offset="899653">The justice... a judge, I'm sorry, of the Superior Court of Puerto Rico, after a preliminary hearing, found probable cause to charge Calder with murder and attempted murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.107" offset="976349">This was done after a hearing, as I said, in which the judge heard testimony from sworn witnesses, and in which Calder was represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.459" offset="1049805">The witnesses, the eyewitnesses, told the judge that Calder had deliberately run his car over... drove his car into the couple, attempted to run down the couple with his car, and that after the wife was down, he repeatedly run over the body, her body, with his car.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.369" offset="1173416">Mr. Calder was freed on bail after the District Attorney filed informations against him for these two alleged crimes, and he failed to appear at two successive hearings in the criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.938" offset="1287728">And the court... another judge in the district... in the Superior Court ordered him to be arrested, issued a warrant of arrest, after declaring him a fugitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.451" offset="1357736">He was found in Iowa, his native state, and there a request was made to the Governor of Iowa that Calder be extradited.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.871" offset="1427431">The request of the Governor of Puerto Rico was... fully complied with all the requirements, both statutory and constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.040" offset="1484065">In spite of that, an extradition hearing was held.</text>

            <text syncTime="370.493" offset="1625857">Apparently, what the court felt was that there was no danger that he would not appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.749" offset="1658876">And he was working in Puerto Rico as an air controller.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.392" offset="1681550">And only $5,000 bond was required from him.</text>

            <text syncTime="422.639" offset="1834523">At the hearing, evidence was admitted to... by the declarations and testimony of Calder, of Calder's companion at the scene of the crime, of the alleged crimes, and of Calder's attorneys, to the fact that the Puerto Rico courts were unable to administer properly justice in this case, in Calder's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.697" offset="2002752">Calder and his other two witnesses stated that there was a prejudice against white American men like Calder, and that, under those circumstances, the trial--</text>
            <text syncTime="493.297" offset="2117168">They also brought hearsay evidence to the effect that witnesses had been bought... bought off in Puerto Rico in some cases, and they attacked in that way the integrity and the quality of the justice of... that is afforded by the Puerto Rico courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.924" offset="2219673">Now, the Governor of Iowa tried to intercede on Calder's behalf in some plea bargaining between Calder's attorneys and the Puerto Rico prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.241" offset="2320923">They were bargaining on whether to accept a plea of guilty from Calder on a lesser charge, and also, whether a sentence of probation would be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.333" offset="2397305">The prosecutors conditioned all plea bargaining upon Calder's voluntary return to Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.392" offset="2449550">And the governor then tried to intercede and had some talks with Governor Romero of Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.058" offset="2500123">These talks failed, and thereon, the Governor of Iowa denied extradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.794" offset="2527082">The Commonwealth filed a complaint in the District Court seeking a writ of mandamus against the Governor of Iowa to order him to extradite Calder.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.757" offset="2602941">The court refused to issue the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.789" offset="2623108">It held that it was bound by the decision of this Court in Dennison... in Kentucky v. Dennison; that the Federal court had now power to order the state governor to extradite Calder.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.382" offset="2697505">The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed that judgment reluctantly, stating that the reasoning and the underpinnings of the Dennison case had been undermined, had been eroded to such a degree that the court... the only court empowered to do so, the Supreme Court, should reconsider it.</text>

            <text syncTime="694.449" offset="2921740">That is so only if you insist that Puerto Rico is a state within the meaning of the provision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.974" offset="2947862">You have a statute that purports to require extradition to either a state, a district or a territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.443" offset="2997704">Might now the power of the United States be different insofar as its ability is concerned to require a state to extradite to a territory, than it is with regard to its power to require a state to extradite to another state?</text>

            <text syncTime="731.685" offset="3070638">--Well, the power of Congress to enact the extradition act is based on the implied power of Congress to implement the extradition clause.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="756.879" offset="3171470">Well, maybe this statute, insofar as it might apply to Puerto Rico, is not an implementation of the extradition clause of the Constitution but is an implementation of Congress' power to govern territories.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lino_j_saldana" startTime="771.359" stopTime="969.969">
            <label>Mr. Lino J. Saldana</label>
            <text syncTime="771.359" offset="3229358">--Well, that power cannot justify the Congress ordering a state to extradite a fugitive to a territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.772" offset="3294977">It would operate for Congress to direct a territory to extradite to a state, or to extradite to another territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.759" offset="3350984">But the power of Congress to implement the clause as it did, ordering a state to extradite a fugitive to a territory, must rest on something other than the territorial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.383" offset="3425485">It rests on the implied power of Congress, under the very... under the extradition clause itself, to implement that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.698" offset="3466759">And for... history reveals that the extradition statute was approved in 1793 a few years after the Constitution was ratified; and the people and the Congressmen who were there were, many of them were members of the Convention, lawyers and framers of the Constitution, who had at least drafted the Constitution and participated in the process of ratification.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.427" offset="3633629">Now it has long been considered... it is really beyond question... that this contemporary interpretation of Congress, of the meaning of the extradition clause, is valid, and that it shows that Congress, in the extradition... that the extradition clause of the Constitution goes beyond states, beyond the 13 states of the Union; that it includes other entities like territories, like the Commonwealth, like the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.548" offset="3834145">Now we may not have... it may not be necessary to decide that question, because the statute, as Justice Scalia points out, imposes the duty of extradition upon the Iowa State Governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.082" offset="3916274">There is no problem, no doubt, that it is a valid statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.455" offset="3937799">And there is no doubt that it applies to Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.029" offset="3956084">Before 1952, this Court so expressly held.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.783" offset="3979072">And after 1952, it is also clear that the extradition act was undisturbed in its application to Puerto Rico.</text>

            <text syncTime="1891.849" offset="7711343">--Only a part of it, Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.901" offset="7723568">The history of the extradition clause is, first, that the courts have consistently stayed out of its interpretation; not simply the Federal courts, but the courts of all 50 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.458" offset="7769753">And there's some 8,000 state-years of accumulative experience have stayed out, and have not intervened under state constitutions which deal with extradition as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.993" offset="7803921">And as a result, in the absence of this judicial intervention, an executive common law tradition of interpreting the extradition clause of the Constitution and the state constitutions has developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.704" offset="7858778">And what that executive common law tradition is basically is that the... the extradition clause in the Constitution does establish a general principle to be applied when states request that a fugitive be delivered up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.733" offset="7922830">And the language is, of course "shall".</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.595" offset="7930354">Just as the First Amendment says Congress shall pass no law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.447" offset="7941743">And the full faith and credit clause says, full faith and credit shall be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.749" offset="7958879">And that has been recognized by all the governors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.510" offset="7969955">And extradition occurs on a routine basis, day-in and day-out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.814" offset="7983225">The question in this case is what happens at the edges of the doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.486" offset="7997854">Every constitutional bone has cartilage on the edge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.259" offset="8013005">And that's where we are in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.720" offset="8018856">We're at the very edges of the doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.773" offset="8027007">And the question is, who decides when to extradite and when not to extradite, and under what conditions?</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.497" offset="8057936">And the governors have come up with the following executive common law tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.048" offset="8076117">As I said, first it's generally a duty to extradite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.981" offset="8091895">However, where there is a serious question of the safety of the individual in the demanding state, extradition may be denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="2001.881" offset="8151454">--There's a smattering of case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.372" offset="8161381">And admittedly, I must say, some of the case law is fairly oblique.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.136" offset="8176427">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.007" offset="8179980">Because the governors' statements are not necessarily sweeping judicial statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.101" offset="8204326">In general, it's a summary executive proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.453" offset="8217701">There isn't findings of fact and conclusions of law, or anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.957" offset="8231807">But my sources on these, if you look through Moore, Spear and Scott, which are the key extradition treatises, they present to you circumstances in which states have declined to extradite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.254" offset="8276946">And if you look at South Dakota v. Brown, the latest Supreme Court case... California Supreme Court case... there's a canvass.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.718" offset="8310801">My bottom line point, however, is that this executive tradition has developed over a hundred years in interpreting... over 200 years, really... in interpreting that constitutional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.547" offset="8354164">Secondly, informal mechanisms of resolution of extradition disputes have grown up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.311" offset="8377152">There's a National Governors Association, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.013" offset="8388019">And there was reference to discussion between the governors of these states with respect to this extradition matter, and that occurred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.278" offset="8421038">There's a national association of extradition officials, and they put out these manuals and pamphlets and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.141" offset="8444443">And they get together and debate and discuss extradition questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.804" offset="8459176">So there's been... in the absence of judicial intervention, which has been gone from the environment for 200 years, these informal mechanisms have grown up.</text>
