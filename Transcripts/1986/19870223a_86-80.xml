            <text syncTime="14.808" offset="186595">The question here is whether the Constitution allows states, as it has allowed the federal government, to regulate a specific industry in order to meet a compelling public need and to enforce that regulatory scheme with warrantless inspections.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.049" offset="255558">New York State's effort to regulate the vehicle dismantlers industry for the purpose of curbing the serious problem of auto theft with its attendant economic burdens and physical safety burdens falls squarely under the well settled criteria of Biswell, Colonnade and Donovan versus Dewey.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.228" offset="340300">The New York regulatory scheme under 415-a of the Vehicle Traffic law is aimed at vehicle dismantlers and has three interrelated components: registration and re-registration on a periodic basis, comprehensive record keeping requirements, and warrantless inspections.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.189" offset="428176">The administrative purposes of the regulatory scheme are as follows: the protection of legitimate vehicle dismantlers; to return more stolen cars to owners, which is an important purpose in and of itself and also to reduce insurance costs; by the record keeping requirement to deter would-be auto thieves; to trace cars back to the auto thieves; and to prevent the vehicle dismantling industry from being used as a mechanism for fencing stolen cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.753" offset="562445">The statute at issue here has been criticized as being designed to allow police officers to conduct warrantless searches of inventory, and that the statute serves no real administrative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.919" offset="631095">That reasoning is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.012" offset="643425">It is wrong for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.181" offset="652097">It is wrong, first, because of the legislative history of the statute which establishes clearly that New York State first set up a regulatory scheme that included no inspection of inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.799" offset="718553">The inspection of inventory was added only six years... was added six years after the statute went into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.375" offset="752930">And the purpose of doing that was to make sure that the other components of the regulatory scheme worked; namely, the registration and the record keeping components.</text>

            <text syncTime="551.199" offset="2332189">It is my understanding that in the past, from time to time Department of Consumer Affairs personnel also enforce the regulatory scheme and then police officers, as part of a special auto crimes unit, would engage in routine inspections under the administrative statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.425" offset="2409093">And indeed the routine... the administrative quality of this inspection is shown by the questions that were asked when the police originally arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.346" offset="2444829">As the record shows, the police had no hint, suspicion, hunch or anything, or tip that there was any criminal activity going on, on these premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.277" offset="2480460">When they arrived the first questions that they asked were, are you registered as a vehicle dismantler under the registration requirement, and do you have the police book, the records required to be kept.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.757" offset="2530406">Then when they answered no to that, they went ahead and inspected the inventory which is, as the record shows, the normal procedure whether the records are there or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.519" offset="2573456">With respect to the privacy interests involved here, they are marginal and negligible at best.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.311" offset="2616610">In the first place you have, in this case, the business of the vehicle dismantler being conducted in an open field, if you can imagine an open field in Brooklyn.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.899" offset="2663003">There were no structures on the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.022" offset="2683483">Indeed, there was no demarcation of what was public and what was private.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.411" offset="2701038">This is typical of junk yards.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.192" offset="2708143">Indeed, the word "junk yards" suggests that much of the business is going to be conducted out in the open as is typical with regard to large vehicles which are dismantled, and the scrap business.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.296" offset="2756626">In addition, there was a very wide entrance way to this vehicle dismantler's premises, of 20 to 25 feet in width.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.012" offset="2791421">Moreover, people were admitted to these premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.462" offset="2813260">The public came on to sell the dealer refrigerators, scrap, automobiles, and this is typical of the vehicle dismantlers business.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.536" offset="2853593">Vehicle dismantlers must do commerce with people coming in for the purpose of buying the vehicles to begin with, and of selling the results of their dismantling.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.033" offset="2891523">Third, what was the nature of the inspection of inventory that took place?</text>
            <text syncTime="697.234" offset="2916287">It was simply the inspection of vehicle identification numbers or VINs which, as this Court has recognized in the past, for which the Court has recognized in the past, there is no expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.619" offset="2969890">It was at most an extremely unintrusive search of the inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.881" offset="2990892">And in addition, this is an industry that has been pervasively regulated, so the expectations of a person entering into the vehicle dismantler business, with regard to privacy, are low.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.579" offset="3049720">With regard to junkyards, a lower court in New York has found that secondhand dealers, junkyard dealers, have been regulated for more than 140 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1734.033" offset="7063487">We think there are two issues in the case, the first being whether the subject matter of the statutes is one to be granted exemption from the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment, and two, whether the statutes themselves in this instance are sufficiently tailored to the state's proper objectives to adequately minimize the dangers inherent in the unbridled exercise of administrative discretion.</text>
