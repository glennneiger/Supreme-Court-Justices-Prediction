            <label>Mr. Cornish F. Hitchcock</label>
            <text syncTime="12.621" offset="199017">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.542" offset="210615">This case presents important questions about the practice of law and the administration of justice in our Federal district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.350" offset="237887">At issue is a rule of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana which requires members of that court's bar to live or have an office in the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.956" offset="280310">In order to focus on the precise nature of the dispute, it's useful to identify what this rule requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.953" offset="308313">Under the rule, members of the Eastern District bar must be located in the Eastern District, the Middle District or the Western District of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.841" offset="339869">And in order to see how the rule operates vis-a-vis the petitioner, it may be useful to consult the map that we prepared in our opening brief as an appendix at page 6A.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.196" offset="381247">Mr. Frazier's application was denied because he lives and practices in Pascagoula, Mississippi, which is approximately 110 miles from New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.316" offset="421789">By contrast, a lawyer located in Lake Charles, Louisiana, which is 200 miles from New Orleans, may be admitted to the Eastern District bar, and a lawyer located in Shreveport, Louisiana, 300 miles from New Orleans, may also be admitted to the Eastern District bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.326" offset="489812">Indeed, lawyers from Lake Charles or Shreveport may serve as local counsel for lawyers such as Mr. Frazier in practicing in New Orleans, even though they're twice the distance from the courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.368" offset="537981">In our brief, we have advanced several reasons why we believe this rule is invalid, but it boils down to essentially one complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.099" offset="572881">As the Court of Appeals recognized, this rule is both overinclusive as well as underinclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.579" offset="598795">And however it may be analyzed, we submit that it does not advance the goals of lawyer competence and availability for hearings that are attributed to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.622" offset="639023">In our view, this Court's decision in Supreme Court of New Hampshire v. Piper provides the proper analytical framework for deciding the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.838" offset="675804">And in mentioning Piper, I want to focus exactly on what we are arguing and are not arguing.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.555" offset="698687">We recognize that Piper was decided under the privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, which is a direct limitation on state action and not on federal action; and we are not making a claim for relief under Article IV.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.548" offset="754693">What we are saying is that this rule is a violation of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.796" offset="783637">And in urging the Court to so hold, we are asking the Court to employ the analysis that was used in Piper in the context of analyzing this rule, just as the Court has incorporated equal protection analysis as a component of Fifth Amendment due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.789" offset="851660">There are several reasons why we believe such analysis is appropriate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.601" offset="866915">The rule in the Eastern District of Louisiana, with its exclusion of lawyers from out of the state--</text>

            <text syncTime="185.269" offset="889590">Excuse me, Mr. Hitchcock, before you go any further, that's a little difficult to do, because the privileges and immunities analysis prevents discrimination between citizens from different states, rights, on the basis of statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.029" offset="948626">But the Federal Government does that all the time, and the Constitution specifically says when it is that the government can't discriminate between the states, in certain types of taxation for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.180" offset="1001185">But the government very often provides particular benefits or takes particular action which just affects one state and not others.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.489" offset="1038488">So how can you possibly apply the state discrimination concept of the privileges and immunities clause to the due process clause?</text>

            <text syncTime="230.453" offset="1070357">--The distinction in this case, as opposed to traditional cases where Congress passes a law, or national body engages in linedrawing of that nature, is, we have here a rule that was adopted by a local unit of the Federal Government that is exercising delegated authority, not--</text>

            <text syncTime="248.790" offset="1143604">Why would you treat that differently from something enacted by Congress?</text>
            <text syncTime="254.741" offset="1167428">I mean, supposing the regional director of the EPA in San Francisco adopts a particular rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.973" offset="1192401">Now, it may have problems with parochialism, but nonetheless, we treat is an exercise of delegated authority from the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.031" offset="1232630">--It is an exercise of delegated authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.936" offset="1240257">But when the line is drawn, for example, if the EPA regional officer said that only people in California could practice before us or something of that nature, when the linedrawing by a local entity is on the basis of state lines, there are problems that have been raised... that are raised by that of the sort that are implicated by the privileges and immunities clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.711" offset="1315386">And to that extent... it's one thing if national body had adopted restrictions of this nature, saying... making that kind of decision and that kind of linedrawing.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.301" offset="1349658">But it's another thing for a local unit of government, in... local unit of the Federal Government, in consultation with local lawyers in this case, to try to be exercising that kind of discretion.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="311.327" stopTime="315.435">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="311.327" offset="1393753">Well, do you agree that if Conress had adopted this, you would have no claim?</text>

            <label>Mr. Cornish F. Hitchcock</label>
            <text syncTime="315.435" offset="1410262">If Congress had passed this rule, we would not be arguing that it should be analyzed under privileges and immunities analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.777" offset="1435653">There would be equal protection arguments that would be made, but the problem here that we think should trigger the type of privileges and immunities analysis is the fact that it's a local unit of the government, using delegated authority, and that it has an exclusionary effect that the court has recognized raised problems requiring heightened consideration if it were enacted in a state court system.</text>

            <text syncTime="345.828" offset="1531784">I don't know what you mean by a local unit of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.250" offset="1537531">I mean, that has some meaning applied to a state where you have a state constitution th8at gives municipalities certain powers, whether the... whether the county or whether the state government desires it, willy-nilly.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.995" offset="1588522">But... but in the Federal context, I don't know of any Federal local units.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.522" offset="1614540">I know of certain representatives of the Federal Government that exist on a local level, but they're all governed entirely by the will of the entire Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.253" offset="1657485">That have no local autonomy, none of these units, as far as I know, including this Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Cornish F. Hitchcock</label>
            <text syncTime="381.454" offset="1674308">Well, in this case, when I refer to the local unit, I'm referring to the United States district court, which has rulemaking authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.123" offset="1700953">But unlike delegated authority in the context of agencies, there are possibilities of dealing with any such rules through the agency process.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.386" offset="1734076">In this case, the court has some degree... the local district court has autonomy in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.930" offset="1756228">It shares its rulemaking authority with this Court, but it tends to operate on parallel tracks.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="406.679" stopTime="418.080">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="406.679" offset="1775245">But you're arguing at the same time that this Court... you're urging as one of your points in your brief that we should exercise our supervisory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.518" offset="1810563">Doesn't this necessarily mean that this is not a local unit?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="cornish_f_hitchcock" startTime="418.080" stopTime="540.548">
            <label>Mr. Cornish F. Hitchcock</label>
            <text syncTime="418.080" offset="1820803">Well, the rule is autonomous unless, of course, it comes before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.048" offset="1836685">The rule, or the exclusion of nonresidence is final unless of course it comes before a higher body such as this Court which would also have the authority to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.045" offset="1872630">But the point is, that when rules of this nature are adopted at a regional level or a local level, I mean the exclusion is against residents of other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.540" offset="1910664">The Court has said, admittedly in the context of state discrimination, discrimination by state entities of government, that there are special problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.553" offset="1942742">The Court has also said in the equal protection area... and we've cited several of the tax cases from recent terms of the Court... that there are similar problems when the court... when state governments pass legislation also that discriminate or have the effect of charging higher fees or imposing burdens on out-of-staters as well, under equal protection analysis, which would apply in the context of Federal action as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.747" offset="2027484">But I think there are reasons, even if the Court should not proceed under the privileges and immunities clause analysis, for using a heightened form of scrutiny here.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.511" offset="2062592">There is no reason why it is that Federal district courts should be able to adopt exclusionary rules of this sort when the Court said in Piper that they cannot be adopted in the context of a state court system; particularly when the reasons that are given for this type of exclusion are the same that the Court considered and rejected in the Piper case.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.798" offset="2143676">The Court's decision in Hurd v. Hodge, which we cited, suggested that it... they said in that case, bad public policy, it wasn't constitutionally grounded, for Federal courts to be able to, in that case, enforce certain contracts that state courts couldn't; and it's bad public policy here to allow Federal district courts to adopt rules that could not be adopted in the state court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.149" offset="2229044">State court judges, no less than Federal judges, are concerned with the competence of the lawyers who appear before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.272" offset="2257570">They're concerned with the availability of having lawyers who can appear before them in cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.443" offset="2274288">And there is no reason for saying that there are special problems in the Federal court system that are cured by having this type of restriction on lawyers.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="540.548" offset="2310651">Are you sure that it would be unlawful for a state to adopt the kind of rule the Federal court has here?</text>
            <text syncTime="546.264" offset="2333534">This is not, as in Piper, a restriction against residents of other... or against citizens of other states practicing within the state; it's simply a requirement that there be an office within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.008" offset="2392571">Now are you sure that a state couldn't adopt that rule?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="cornish_f_hitchcock" startTime="563.367" stopTime="653.752">
            <label>Mr. Cornish F. Hitchcock</label>
            <text syncTime="563.367" offset="2401975">I believe so.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.428" offset="2406259">I believe that the Court's decision in Piper and the reasoning in Piper is broad enough to include that.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.537" offset="2426635">Justice White's concurring opinion in that case read the Court as reaching that far, because the same problems that you have with exclusions based on residence appear also with exclusions... or with an in-state office requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.623" offset="2487030">The in-state office requirement acts as a surrogate for a residence requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.043" offset="2508659">What it does is, it requires lawyers from out of the state who practice out of the state to open an additional office in Louisiana, which is not a burden imposed upon local lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.023" offset="2556620">I mean, for Louisiana lawyers, an in-state office requirement is largely not much of a restriction and not much of a burden at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.208" offset="2581279">The chances are, they probably have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.504" offset="2586504">But for the court to require that out of state lawyers must have that office in addition, it places burdens on citizens of other states, which as a practical matter, are not imposed on local courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.764" offset="2639585">That was the holding of the New York Court of Appeals in the Gordon case which we cited, where the same option was available for people applying to the state court bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.433" offset="2670200">You could either take the New York State bar exam, you had to be either a resident of the State of New York to be admitted to the bar, or you had to practice in the state before you were admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.991" offset="2708444">And the court reasoned that the same type of problems that are posed by a residence requirement are posed by the requirement that you must have an office in the state, when that's not imposed... or it's not as burdensome as it is on--</text>

            <text syncTime="669.839" offset="2827875">Let me break that down into two parts, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.384" offset="2838011">I think Piper reasoned that one's location or one's distance from the court is not a reason for disqualifying someone for being admitted to the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.521" offset="2874582">I think the Court answered that question in Piper when it said that there maybe some times, as a practical matter, when a lawyer cannot appear, when the lawyer is, as the Court put it, at a great distance from the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.328" offset="2925782">In those cases, local counsel may be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.859" offset="2939888">We submit that a rule which did have that kind of circular or circumferential approach, would be more closely based on the court's goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.903" offset="2972071">If it were 100 miles, or 150 miles, or 200 miles, that's closer in terms of the goal attributed to it, which is assuring that lawyers are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.275" offset="3005612">The vice with this particular rule, as we see it, is that it says, lawyers 300 miles west of New Orleans may be admitted to the bar and may practice without local counsel, but not lawyers who are only 100 miles to the east.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.066" offset="3056812">We submit that it cannot be said that lawyers from 300 miles away are more likely to come over to New Orleans, but not lawyers that are only 100 miles to the east.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.423" offset="3090145">And however the line may be drawn, 150 miles, 200 miles, it's probably likely to be more closely tailored to the goal than the current rule, which focuses on state lines, and excludes people who may be perfectly capable of practicing law.</text>

            <text syncTime="762.943" offset="3200277">Part of the problem is that even it you were to limit it to the Eastern District of Louisiana, it's narrower, but in this case, it has some of the same problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.782" offset="3239670">The Court of Appeals recognized in footnote six of its opinion that there are some lawyers in the Eastern District of Louisiana who are further away from New Orleans than Mr. Frazier.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.606" offset="3282928">The geography of districts is such that in many instances you may have these anomalies.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.620" offset="3302990">Let me give you a local example.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.337" offset="3309887">Let us suppose, for example, that there were a rule of this sort in the Eastern District of Virginia, which covers approximately the eastern one-third of the state, and which has divisions that sit in Alexandria, in Richmond, and in Norfolk.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.879" offset="3364012">And in-district office rule would mean that lawyers from Norfolk, Virginia, could come up and practice in Alexandria without restriction, whereas lawyers in the District of Columbia, which is only ten miles away, as opposed to 180 miles away, could not.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.248" offset="3421482">Now, that's in a situation where you have multiple districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.512" offset="3434543">You have other states where there's only one district.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.871" offset="3443947">So an in-district rule, say in the district of Kansas, would let lawyers from Western Kansas come into Kansas City, Kansas, and practice in the district court there, but not lawyers across the street in Kansas City, Missouri.</text>

            <text syncTime="2263.718" offset="9203320">There's also this ominous comparison to Piper that we perceive in the applicant's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.855" offset="9239892">Piper is very different from Frazier, if I may use those names to designate those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.542" offset="9262670">First of all, we're talking about state law and Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.961" offset="9276359">And that alone is a big distinction between the Piper Article IV problems and the Frazier case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.880" offset="9304048">In Piper we also have this option of not only living in the state but maintaining an office in the state; under either of which gives you automatic, general admission to the Eastern District of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.405" offset="9358070">And more importantly, the continuing requirement of that eligibility puts the real teeth in the rule in Frazier, and at the same time demonstrates the absurdity of the rule in Piper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.586" offset="9438840">Mrs. Piper could have run over to New Hampshire, gotten an apartment or done whatever it was it would take to establish residency, gotten admitted to the court, and run right back 400 yards to her nice house and home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.127" offset="9492966">And it would have made no difference under the Piper rule, because once certified, once admitted, that was it; you could go to Nome, Alaska.</text>

            <text syncTime="3145.692" offset="12731314">I wanted to follow up on the question of the office requirement, Justice Stevens' inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.410" offset="12746151">It was addressed in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.378" offset="12757959">At page 151, Mrs. White, the clerk, said that a mailbox is not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.797" offset="12775722">At page 255, Judge Wicker testified that the office requirement requires only that there be someone to answer the telephone and communicate with the lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.106" offset="12812920">And I would add again that that could be in New Orleans, or it could be in Lake Charles, or it could be in Shreveport, or it could be anywhere else.</text>
