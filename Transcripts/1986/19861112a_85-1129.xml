            <text syncTime="73.429" offset="444177">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="76.564" offset="456716">This case is governed by the principles that were established by this Court in Wygant versus Jackson Board of Education, that before embarking upon a voluntary affirmative action program a public employer must have convincing evidence that remedial action is warranted and, finding that convincing evidence, develop a remedy which is narrowly tailored.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.597" offset="548876">In this case, we have neither convincing evidence that there was a remedial purpose nor was this remedy narrowly tailored when the Santa Clara County Transportation Agency deprived Petitioner Paul Johnson of a well-earned promotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.208" offset="611361">First, again, in the ideal world, before developing a program an employer would look at his work force statistics, compare them with the relevant labor market, consider if there was other probative evidence of discrimination, and finally, as a third step, eliminate explanations other than discrimination, and these are the kind of explanations that an employer would ordinarily consider in rebutting a Title 7 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.827" offset="733823">But even if the employer doesn't do this at the outset, the employer could certainly do that when the program and an employment action taken under it is challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.452" offset="776350">The agency neither went through the process at the beginning nor was the agency able to come forward with convincing evidence of remedial purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.974" offset="814385">The district court heard the corroborating testimony of discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.848" offset="1593879">And specifically, this agency had had an affirmative action program in place for about five years.</text>

            <text syncTime="408.412" offset="1784154">And in fact, the agency relied entirely on the countywide working force for women, not the labor pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.316" offset="1811740">We offered a Petitioner's lodging showing that roughly seven percent of the women in this county at that time were in the skilled craft labor jobs.</text>

            <label>Ms. Constance E. Brooks</label>
            <text syncTime="454.857" offset="1969937">Certainly with respect to what happened to the Petitioner, there's no question they didn't have any short term goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.143" offset="1987074">If this Court is going to go forward with some guidelines, I think that the relevant labor market is the appropriate test.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.582" offset="2012883">That has to be part of the convincing evidence standard that the Court should look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.634" offset="2033049">But the Court... but the agency needed to go behind those statistics and consider whether that number zero had sources other than affirmative actual discrimination by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.024" offset="2082577">We had testimony in the trial that it was attitudinal.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.495" offset="2096474">The plan itself states that women were</text>
            <text syncTime="490.964" offset="2114342">"traditionally not employed in the job. "</text>
            <text syncTime="493.316" offset="2123746">The plan doesn't suggest that the tradition had anything to do with the agency's misdeeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.653" offset="2153108">And even... and perhaps more important, we find that the agency had been actively recruiting and bringing women in.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.444" offset="2192292">And because the agency never kept applicant flow data, we have no idea how many women ever applied for this job.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.847" offset="2221862">But I think that the factors of the effective affirmative action program, the testimony that they were having trouble recruiting women, necessarily means that no women were applying for this specific job and at this specific time.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.524" offset="2280585">And before we leave this subject, I think it's very important to point out that in the road dispatcher position specifically and dispatchers in general 25 percent of the agency's employees were women.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.265" offset="2327606">We were not in... and the relevant labor market at that time was about 22 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.319" offset="2347772">So in the narrow focus of what happened to the Petitioner and what the agency was doing, there was no remedial purpose whatsoever, and the plan should never have applied to that particular aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.960" offset="2398345">I think it's also clear that this plan was never narrowly tailored in an important sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.982" offset="2430424">First of all, we're in the promotion situation, not in terms of hiring, promotions.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.470" offset="2456337">And the burden of this plan applied entirely upon the Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.307" offset="2475772">We know from the record that the job of road dispatcher did not come open very often.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.711" offset="2501372">Petitioner had worked for the agency for 13 years and this job came open only twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.848" offset="2521852">The goals applied throughout the work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.967" offset="2542332">The goals were not limited to the lower echelon positions.</text>

            <text syncTime="837.652" offset="3501131">But again, in terms of bringing women into the work force, you can't force them into the non-traditional jobs, and if they want those jobs they can compete on merit, especially because the agency has made effective efforts to recruit them and bring them into the work force, and that have been very effective in the first five years.</text>

            <text syncTime="964.466" offset="4008324">If this Court were to find that mere statistical imbalance justified affirmative action employment goals, then it would be very easy for an employer to adopt affirmative action without having any incentive to protect the rights of the other employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1132.690" offset="4681239">Weber dealt with a new training program that benefited both black and white employees, and everyone was going to have something new and you didn't have the kind of expectations that have been developed in the work force.</text>

            <text syncTime="1307.532" offset="5380589">As Justice O'Connor pointed out, they never even looked at the real relevant labor market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.150" offset="5399083">And in fact, it's very interesting, because this issue came up when they rewrote their plan in 1978 and the director testified at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.804" offset="5433774">Well, someone raised it, but we really never got too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.958" offset="5446313">So first of all, what we're asking for is a statistical scrutiny, which by itself should not expose the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.295" offset="5479645">Second, he looks for some kind of explanation for these statistics other than discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.883" offset="5506081">This is a process that he would ordinarily go through in defending a Title 7 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.002" offset="5526561">I think it's an appropriate process just as an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.704" offset="5537323">It's not burdensome, and if he finds that there's discrimination and he looks for other corroborative evidence it doesn't have to be specific acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.493" offset="5572432">But we're talking about sort of a minimal effort to ensure that when you've got a plan, you've got a good basis for that plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="3335.699" offset="13493281">Ms. Brooks, do you have something that you wish to say?</text>

            <text syncTime="3339.484" offset="13508432">I just have a few points to respond to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.936" offset="13518254">I think that the facts of this case show why we would suggest that an employer has to show more than a prima facie case before he adopts a voluntary affirmative action plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.577" offset="13564857">And by a prima facie case, I'm talking about a naked statistical balance, because here the agency clearly never went behind and considered whether no women had ever applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.766" offset="13609578">It's not quite correct to say that Petitioner didn't ask for applicant flow data.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.086" offset="13626819">It was requested during discovery and we were told it wasn't available because the county never got the computer program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.574" offset="13652837">That's really not here or there, but I do want to make it clear that we did look for applicant flow data and were told it just wasn't available.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3384.180" offset="13687214">Ms. Brooks, can you explain one thing to me?</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.132" offset="13695051">I'm a little... what difference does it make whether the proper proportion in this particular labor pool, if we're playing statistics, was 30 percent or 5?</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.488" offset="13732458">What difference does it make?</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.154" offset="13735175">Inasmuch as there were no women in this job category at the time anyway, even if the percentage were, the proper percentage were 5 percent instead of 30 percent, presumably in implementing the affirmative action plan the employer would have been justified in preferring this woman.</text>

            <label>Ms. Constance E. Brooks</label>
            <text syncTime="3413.449" offset="13804347">We don't agree that the employer would have been justified in preferring the woman, because if you look at the road dispatcher job you had 20 percent of the employees, 3 out of 18, were already women at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.023" offset="13858577">So the plan should never have applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.875" offset="13865996">But if you look at the plan in general, the fact that they never looked for a relevant labor market goes to the overall crudity of the affirmative action plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.267" offset="13907583">You don't have an employer here who made a good faith effort to develop a plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.135" offset="13923048">You have an employer who basically looked at the overall population, slapped some number in, and then went forward, again without taking into account the rights of the other employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.907" offset="13966097">That's why it's relevant, because this plan is facially discriminatory with respect to all of the unprotected employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="3461.096" offset="13994937">You don't believe there's a harmless error rule?</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.965" offset="14006326">That is, that even if the employer had used the right percentages, an affirmative action plan based on that would have justified preference to this--</text>

            <label>Ms. Constance E. Brooks</label>
            <text syncTime="3473.921" offset="14046241">Not in this case, because there are other explanations for the statistical disparity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.308" offset="14063691">And in fact, you find these in the county's own documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.610" offset="14076961">They admit that they attribute the lack of women here not to "past discrimination"; they attribute it to societal attitudes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.949" offset="14110293">And I don't think that this Court has ever held that women will necessarily occupy the same jobs in direct proportion to their representation in the working force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.971" offset="14146342">I think it's rather obvious that women and men prefer things differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.689" offset="14165255">I'm not saying that that's always good, but attitudes based on sex are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.759" offset="14189497">And I think it's an important factor here that you have women applying for non-traditional jobs in the transit agency and getting them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.949" offset="14226277">You had extensive hiring in terms of women bus drivers and women utility workers, which was the position below becoming a mechanic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.852" offset="14257937">I think what you have here is an explained statistical disparity in that women were going into other jobs and choosing not to work for the roads division, where you had fewer openings and less future opportunity for advancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.128" offset="14314989">But we don't know, because this agency never looked and never considered other alternatives than their assumption that they discriminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.384" offset="14352083">And we say that's wrong and that's why you should have more than just a prima facie case when we talk about convincing evidence that it is appropriate to go into a voluntary affirmative action plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.692" offset="14397327">I think there's another factor here--</text>
