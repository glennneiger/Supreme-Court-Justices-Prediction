            <text syncTime="215.871" offset="1008052">I'd like the Court to note that if you go all the way around Pleasant Grove, there are no... there are basically no roads except in the south, the southeast of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.583" offset="1070955">All those areas except for the southeast of the city are rural areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.737" offset="1095510">The testimony of this map is corroborated by two geological survey maps which are also in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.157" offset="1125185">They are defendant's Exhibits 28 and 29, and they are attached to the Parmley deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.329" offset="1157891">It is important to note that Pleasant Grove, even after all its annexations, is almost completely surrounded by uninhabited territory because, the fact is, before the Highlands area was... the Highlands area was developed in the late 1970s, and the Highlands is a little... is one 40-acre square to the southeast corner of the city, and it's called West Smithfield Petition, because that's the old name of Pleasant Grove Highlands.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.165" offset="1397277">It's important to note that before the Highlands was developed, there were no contiguous black areas to Pleasant Grove, and there were no close black areas except the Dolomite area, which is in this corner of the map.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.876" offset="1460075">Under Alabama law, to annex a... for a city to annex territory, it has to be contiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.899" offset="1500199">Therefore, before the Pleasant Grove-Highlands area was developed, there was no conceivable annexation partner for Pleasant Grove, and therefore there can be no evidence of a pattern of selective annexation.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.750" offset="1615556">--which was in the late 1970s, there can be no evidence of a pattern of selective annexation because there were no blacks to annex.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.422" offset="1650246">They weren't contiguous to the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.040" offset="1660800">If you wanted to annex blacks, you would have to get the permission of the intervening land owners and reach out to areas of black concentration outside of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.015" offset="1708656">There were no contiguous areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.967" offset="1716493">Everything that was annexed was contiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.871" offset="1740108">I'd also like to call the Court's attention to the third exhibit, which is not part of the record but it's referred to in my... it's referred to in my reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.345" offset="1797995">This is a decision which came down this year from the Tenth Judicial Circuit of Alabama, and we're under an obligation to keep the Court apprised of developments which may affect the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.275" offset="1877721">Birmingham annexed all of the area, all the way around Pleasant Grove, and it was set aside in this opinion and it's now on appeal to the Supreme Court of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.435" offset="1934354">But what I'd like to bring the Court's attention to is the language on page 4 in the last complete paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.958" offset="1964447">There's a finding there that the area of Pleasant Grove Highlands and Dolomite together, if annexed by the City of Birmingham, would not pay the City of Birmingham in taxes enough to cover the cost of services, and I'll get back to that when I get to Pleasant Grove Highlands.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.371" offset="2050129">The other developments in this case are that four additional black families either have moved into Pleasant Grove or have houses under construction, so we now have three black families in Pleasant Grove, two houses under construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.731" offset="2111569">We have two black voters in Pleasant Grove.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.499" offset="2122645">I just determined this today.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.451" offset="2134452">Four of these five houses are in the area of the 1967 annexation, which is relevant because as we have argued, all annexations to Pleasant Grove tend... well, they don't tend very much... but they do tend to integrate the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.761" offset="2203624">We submit, Your Honor, that the annexation of the western addition, the time it was made, it's already been held there was no discriminatory effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.518" offset="2242704">We contend that we've shown that there can't be a discriminatory purpose, because if you look at what could have been in the minds of the city councilmen at the time that they voted for this annexation, there's no way, there's no rational, racial purpose that can arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.900" offset="2336222">First of all, at the time they made this decision... this is February of 1979... there's been no annexation in eight years.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.823" offset="2367882">The last one was the Glasgow annexation.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.806" offset="2375824">The last considerable annexation was in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.227" offset="2389512">The '67 annexation was in three parts, but the main parcel which is about 1,600 acres is very much like the western addition.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.166" offset="2425247">It surrounds the city to the west and the south, and the western addition tacks onto that.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.237" offset="2449593">That was almost entirely undeveloped land.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.689" offset="2467357">The city's conviction is that it gets money from that, and the record bears that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.525" offset="2490658">That annexation, the one in 1967, was pre-cleared by the Justice Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.012" offset="2524617">That's number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.731" offset="2527543">Number two, they're adding vacant land owned first by the city and second by developers living within the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.070" offset="2572891">Third, it's uncontroverted on this record that taking in undeveloped land yields substantial fees for the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.525" offset="2606746">The Mays affidavit, which is at the end of the Joint Appendix... we have to do some additions and subtractions... but the Mays affidavit shows that development fees contributed 25 percent of expenditures in the two years before this vote in 1979, about 25 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.589" offset="2682919">Fourth, Pleasant Grove was all white.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.624" offset="2695144">It doesn't have a white majority that it needs to defend.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.378" offset="2718132">And finally, all annexations, logically, because they add new houses, because we have fair housing laws, every time we add a new house, every time we put a house on the market for sale, if you're all white and you want to stay all white you don't add new houses.</text>

            <text syncTime="688.391" offset="2898168">The other annexation that is at issue here today is the Glasgow annexation.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.877" offset="2924082">This is more difficult for us to justify under Voting Rights Act criteria because it was... Glasgow's petition in 1969 at a time when Jefferson County schools were being desegregated and Pleasant Grove was attempting to set up its own separate school system, the Glasgows were in that school; that is, they were in the Pleasant Grove school at the time the changes were made, and they wished to remain there.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.814" offset="3043827">So, they asked to be taken into the city, and because they were good friends, basically, of a city councilman named Mr. Parmley, as Judge McKinnon found, they got in.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.073" offset="3096908">When the District Court required us to add the Glasgow annexation to our complaint, to pre-clear the western annexation, we told the court that rather than do that we would prefer to abandon it, and the court told us that they wouldn't allow us to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.237" offset="3185515">That's not relevant except if the argument is made that we're trying to add white voters, we certainly tried to get rid of these white voters, as soon as any difficulties were presented, in favor of an area with no white voters, to with, the western addition which has no people in it at all, at least for the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.833" offset="3263882">But if we look at what goes through the mind of a city councilman, and if the issue is, are they discriminating with respect to voting, at the time they make that decision, we submit, they are not discriminating with respect to voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.958" offset="3316441">There are no black areas petitioning at that time, for the reason that we stated before, there were no black areas continguous to Pleasant Grove until the late 1970s, and this is 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.932" offset="3368372">They got in because they were in the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.218" offset="3377463">They were friends of people in Pleasant Grove, and they let them in so they could stay in the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.287" offset="3401704">This brings us to the area which the government claims we should have let in and we did not let in, on racially discriminatory grounds, and that is the area of Pleasant Grove Highlands which is that 40-acre section to the southeast of the city which is marked, "West Smithfield Petition".</text>
            <text syncTime="841.189" offset="3509329">When this petition came to the attention of the city council, they appointed a committee to study it and the committee basically concluded, based not on any new study it made but on its practice in the last... since 1967, to take in undeveloped land to get the development fees, that it was not economical to take it in.</text>

            <text syncTime="3104.213" offset="12561489">But when you look at the pattern and you see what the policy is, that it's creating this checkerboard and that they've had 500 similar annexations like this, there comes a time when it's fair to say that we know what's going on here and we know what the purpose is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.973" offset="12620526">And, while the consequence is simply that this annexation is not permitted, it is certainly available to the Attorney General and to the Court to weigh the probative evidence indicating the city's purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="3140.036" offset="12704744">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.821" offset="12723866">First of all, Justice Scalia, what Mr. Ganzfried said about sales in the 1967 addition... I mean, annexation, that every single house was sold to white people is inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.598" offset="12786978">As I represented this morning, four have now been sold to black people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.067" offset="12808921">Secondly, the city is not ringed by unincorporated black communities as Mr. Ganzfried said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.237" offset="12837551">As we pointed out... as I pointed out in the beginning of my argument, supported by the postal map of Pleasant Grove, unincorporated black communities... the postal map of Pleasant Grove and geological survey, except for the southeast of the city, it is surrounded by empty land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.932" offset="12904320">Third, it doesn't really mean much to say that the 1979 decision to take in the western addition is contemporaneous with the decision not to take in Pleasant Grove Highlands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.406" offset="12954266">It's true, there's some overlap but the timing is as follows: in late 1978 the people who owned... the people who lived in Pleasant Grove, who owned the western addition, came to the city and started talking to the Mayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.000" offset="13016646">The Mayor presented the question to the City Council on February 5th.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.070" offset="13036917">It was immediately sent to the State Legislature of Alabama, which was willing to consider it only because it was completely unpopulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.609" offset="13079027">The State Legislature of Alabama will not vote to take one community into another community if there are people in there unless they get a chance to vote on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.715" offset="13115494">So that, the two if... they decided to take in the Highlands, they couldn't combine these two decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.619" offset="13147050">Then in March of 1979 they took away the fire and paramedic protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.856" offset="13168052">In April the Highlands asked to be annexed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.177" offset="13185293">Then it was sent to a committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.493" offset="13194593">Some months later, at the end of 1979, they said, we'll give you your fire and paramedic protection back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.931" offset="13216326">Then there was some shilly-shallying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.782" offset="13223745">Eventually they didn't do anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="3324.400" offset="13442233">Judge McKinnon went the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.869" offset="13452055">With respect to the City of Richmond case and the City of Rome cases, of course we depend heavily on the City of Richmond case because it's our contention that if Pleasant Grove tried to bring in the Highlands, it would be a violation of the Voting Rights Act because the effect... it would be an effect of diluting their vote, diluting their vote for essential city services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.735" offset="13539513">So, we rely very heavily on the Richmond case, against the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.436" offset="13558322">What makes Richmond and Rome different from this case, in both of those cases you had large cities with large black minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.625" offset="13595102">In the Richmond case, Richmond actually had a black majority before the annexation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.612" offset="13615060">So, there's a reason to attribute to the white people some sensitivity to bringing in a few more white people, but we don't have that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.254" offset="13657587">There were no black people, no black voters in Pleasant Grove at the time these decisions were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.789" offset="13679739">In the City of Rome case we have a lot of annexations of vacant land, but there, if my memory's correct, there were 60 annexations in four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.779" offset="13723729">So, it's plausible the conflate to put together all the annexations and say, well, there's one common purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.199" offset="13753404">But here you're talking about four annexations in 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.084" offset="13772944">As to the point about... Justice Scalia's point and Justice O'Connor's point, I think that the government's position in this case does ask us to make decisions based on speculation as to future impacts on voting, and you can argue that one way or the other on the literal language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.349" offset="13861969">But as a practical matter, what are you going to do with cases in which there's going to be no impact on voting for five or six years except to say, for the immediate future there's no effect.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas G. Corcoran, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3443.090" offset="13916931">Because of the City of Richmond case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.894" offset="13932186">the City of Richmond case, Perkins v. Mathews, City of Richmond case, suggested that annexations were covered by the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.434" offset="13974295">I certainly think, Justice O'Connor, that if the Justice Department came out with regulations and said, in cases like this case you're not to petition until you have an immediate effect, that the Court would defer to those regulations and there would be no problem in upholding them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.330" offset="14053917">But of course, they don't have those regulations, and there was a holding from this Court, and the practice of the Attorney General, of course, was to look at these things immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.638" offset="14107102">Finally... and I end on a weak note here, but finally, as to the so-called mushroom problem, I'd like the Court to entertain our argument that the mushroom problem refers not to Pleasant Grove Highlands but to Dolomite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.580" offset="14170945">Dolomite is a very poor area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.599" offset="14178991">The city did not want to be in a position where it had to offer services to Dolomite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.936" offset="14196336">As I've said before, the city has a custom of offering free services to small communities around its borders, when it doesn't have any problem covering its own area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.894" offset="14244193">Dolomite is a very large community and the city did want to have to take in Dolomite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.748" offset="14275644">And at the time they made these decisions about the mushroom problem, the mushroom problem was not directed towards Pleasant Grove Highlands because these communities that they were thinking... that they didn't take in didn't abut on... either didn't abut on the Highlands, or two, the Highlands didn't exist at the time the decisions were made.</text>
