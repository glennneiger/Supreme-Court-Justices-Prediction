            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="8.292" offset="125020">This case comes to us on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.651" offset="154486">The respondent, psychiatrist, was an employee of a State Hospital in California, and had primary responsibility for training positions in the psychiatric residency program.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.224" offset="208717">Hospital officials became concerned about possible improprieties in his management of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.698" offset="234630">Particularly with respect to his acquisition of a computer and charges against him concerning sexual harassment of female hospital employees and inappropriate disciplinary action against the resident.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.648" offset="290428">While he was on the administrative leave pending investigation of the charges, hospital officials allegedly, in order to inventory and secure state property, searched his office and seized his personal items from his desk and file cabinets that were used then in administrative proceedings resulting in his discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.142" offset="380393">Respondent filed an action against the hospital officials in Federal District Court under Section 1983 alleging that the search of his office violated the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.932" offset="435564">The District Court granted summary judgment for the hospital officials, concluding that the search was proper because there was a need to secure state property in the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.032" offset="476001">The Court of Appeals reversed in part concluding that the respondent had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his office, and that the search violated the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.132" offset="520410">The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the District Court for determination of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.792" offset="542979">In an opinion file today, we reverse the partial summary judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.694" offset="578610">We recognize that searches and seizures by government employers or supervisors of the private property of their employees are subject to Fourth Amendment restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.373" offset="625317">Majority of the Court finds on the facts of this case that Dr. Ortega had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his office.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.824" offset="659172">That does not end the inquiry however, because it still must be determined by the courts below whether the search at issue complied with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.391" offset="701386">We hold that the standard to be applied in the context of a search by a government employer of an employee's office desk or file cabinet for a work related purpose, is one of reasonable most under all of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.310" offset="765125">We reject the application of a warrant requirement or a probable cause standard in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.271" offset="792919">The opinion is joined by only four members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.927" offset="807548">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment; Justice Blackman has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Brennan, Marshall and Stevens have joined.</text>
