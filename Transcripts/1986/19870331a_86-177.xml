            <text syncTime="15.010" offset="203811">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.610" offset="214260">This case is here on petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which affirmed criminal convictions for conspiracy and mail fraud arising out of the award of contracts by Seminole Electric Cooperative, a private Florida corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.672" offset="290433">Two issues are presented for this Court's consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.539" offset="305898">First, whether Section 371 of Title 18 U.S.C., which prohibits conspiracies to defraud the United States or any agency thereof, extends to a conspiracy to defraud a private corporation which is neither an agency nor a representative of the federal government, and which only connection with the federal government is that it is the recipient of a loan guaranteed by the Rural Electrification Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.928" offset="435465">Secondly, where a sworn affidavit that jurors were consuming large amounts of alcohol, were utilizing and dealing in marijuana, and were ingesting cocaine throughout the course of a complex criminal proceeding, required an evidentiary hearing in order to make a determination as to whether these jurors were rendered incompetent to consider and decide the case in violation of their Sixth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.249" offset="568794">Seminole Electric Cooperative is a Florida corporation formed by 11 rural electric cooperatives in the State of Florida for the purpose of generating and transmitting electrical energy in north and central Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.958" offset="631592">That corporation in 1979 made application through the REA to borrow $1.1 billion from the Federal Financing Bank in order to construct a coal-fired generating plant near Polacta, Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.037" offset="691883">As part of the construction of that plant, it was necessary to construct a patrol road beneath an electrical transmission line which extended from the coal-fired plant to a substation outside of Ocala, a distance of practically 51 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.297" offset="760951">That patrol road was in order to construct the line itself and later to maintain the road and the transmission facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.604" offset="798149">That original contract was awarded to Jernigan Construction Company out of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.774" offset="822913">In 1979, work on the plant and the patrol road began, and by March of 1981 it became apparent that the materials being utilized by Jernigan were insufficient for the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.982" offset="875681">They simply would not compact sufficiently to hold the trucks and vehicles that had to transgress this road.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.922" offset="907445">Accordingly, the officials at Seminole Electric directed the Director of Procurement, the petitioner here, Mr. Conover, to find another source of material to construct the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.062" offset="960004">Mr. Conover, in his position as Director of Procurement, went to his friend Anthony Tanner who was a local developer and is also a petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.768" offset="1002845">Mr. Tanner owned a lime rock mine in the area and suggested the use of lime rock overburden as a material to be used in place of the sugar sand material which Jernigan was attempting to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.278" offset="1060941">That material was used on an interim basis under a purchase order after being inspected by the engineering department of Seminole Electric.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.400" offset="1101378">The material proved satisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.902" offset="1111410">Because of internal policies of Seminole Electric, a bid was required for any project which cost more than $200,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.107" offset="1148190">Accordingly, specifications were drawn up for two contracts, one for a fill contract which utilized the same specifications of the material being submitted by Mr. Tanner under the purchase order, and the second for spreading contract to complete work on the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.255" offset="1220810">Both of those contracts were let for bid and petitioner Tanner was low bidder with respect to each.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.659" offset="1246410">Accordingly, he was awarded the contracts and completed construction of the patrol roads in late 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.447" offset="1289565">Just prior to the completion of construction, one of the electrical cooperatives raised questions concerning the business relationships between Tanner and Conover and whether they violated the conflict of interest policies of Seminole Electric.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.076" offset="1360095">As a result of that investigation, an indictment was brought in the United States District Court in June of 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.765" offset="1390815">That indictment charged in count one a conspiracy to defraud the United States under Section 371 by impeding the lawful function of the REA in administering and enforcing its guaranteed loan program.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.543" offset="1458002">It contended that Tanner was given an advantage over competitors by the specifications drawn for the contracts, and that Tanner and Conover, by their personal business dealings, violated the conflict of interest policy of Seminole and therefore the program was not honestly and fairly administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.188" offset="1536578">The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed these convictions and found that what the Court termed 371, based on the interest of the federal government in seeing that the entire project was administered honestly, and efficiently, and without corruption and waste.</text>

            <label>Justice Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="372.672" offset="1634485">Was that a divided opinion?</text>

          <turn speaker="john_a_devault_iii" startTime="374.422" stopTime="494.867">
            <label>Mr. John A. DeVault, III</label>
            <text syncTime="374.422" offset="1641486">There was a special concurring opinion by Judge Hill, Your Honor, and he consented and concurred in the judgment because he felt bound by a prior Fifth Circuit decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.463" offset="1685685">But with respect to the conspiracy issue, Judge Hill evidenced, and stated in his special concurring opinion, that if he were not bound by that opinion he would find that these actions did not violate Section 371.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.092" offset="1752141">We raise in point one to this Court the fact that this Court has never heretofore upheld a conviction based on a conspiracy to defraud the United States under Section 371, where the defendants neither defrauded the federal government of its funds or property, nor interfered with a U.S. government official or their agents performing an official function of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.825" offset="1863109">Indeed, given the pervasive nature of federal assistance programs and guarantees, an affirmance of this conviction under 371, we suggest would lead to limitless boundaries and in fact create a new national all-inclusive criminal code.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.405" offset="1941372">Section 371 has two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.107" offset="1956210">The first part of the statute, which is the one most often utilized, prohibits conspiracies to commit any substantive offense against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.746" offset="1998737">The second part of the statute which is at issue on this petition, and which is much less frequently used, prohibits conspiracies to defraud the United States or any agency thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.140" offset="2052340">Therefore, when an indictment charges the second part of Section 371, it is the conspiracy itself which is the substantive crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.329" offset="2089121">It is not necessary for the government to allege and prove a substantive federal offense as it is in the first part of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="498.719" offset="2138649">Exactly, Your Honor, of course, in order to reach the conspiracy you would have to prove that initial element, my point being that whereas the first section is anchored to a substantive federal offense, so there is no question as to what the defendant is being charged, the second section is not so anchored.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.745" offset="2206776">It permits a charge of defrauding the United States or any agency thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.549" offset="2226002">Here we suggest on this record there was no evidence that the government, the federal government or any agency thereof suffered any monetary or property loss, nor was there any evidence of any interference with a lawful function of government.</text>

            <text syncTime="551.568" offset="2350032">But the allegations can be read that the actual party being defrauded was Seminole Electric.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.674" offset="2386498">That is the party, of course, that was employed but REA was named as the guarantor and the federal agency that was being defrauded.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.130" offset="2424324">Seminole Electric is a private Florida corporation, and the federal government has no proprietary interest whatsoever in that company.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.354" offset="2473225">The only connection between this conspiracy and the REA or the federal government is the fact that there was a guaranteed construction loan, guaranteed by the REA, two years prior to these contracts which are here at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.918" offset="2555458">Looking to the legislative history of Section 371, there is simply no showing that Congress intended to punish a conspiracy to defraud a purely private entity.</text>

            <text syncTime="627.818" offset="2655037">The government's argument is that we defrauded REA, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.937" offset="2671547">But the fact is that REA was simply a guarantor of the loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.210" offset="2708641">Thus, we suggest, there was no monetary or property loss to the REA nor was any governmental function of the REA interfered with.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.768" offset="2758900">As Judge Hill pointed out, Congress certainly could, had it decided to do so, have required or permitted REA to construct rural electric plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.741" offset="2798711">It chose not to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1679.765" offset="6862841">At the outset, I'd like to address Justice O'Connor's question earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.817" offset="6879037">We have no doubt that petitioners and Seminole Electric here were bound by REA bidding procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.673" offset="6914459">Only one of the two contracts required prior approval but both contracts, as the REA bulletins in the record suggest, and as the testimony, uncontroverted by the REA official on pages 24, 27 and 32 of the Joint Appendix show, the bidding requirements designed to ensure that the lowest responsible bidder would be awarded the contract, did apply to these contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.355" offset="7009232">Petitioners seek reversal of their conviction for conspiring to defraud the United States, and alternatively claim that they are entitled to an evidentiary hearing to interrogate the jury who convicted them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.715" offset="7062626">Because we believe that the petitioners' fraudulent activities fall within the scope of Section 371, and because we also believe that the post-verdict interrogation of jurors sought by petitioners in this case is barred by rule 606B of the Federal Rules of Evidence, we would urge the Court to affirm the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.577" offset="7134097">In our view, petitioners conspired to defraud the United States in two distinct respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.913" offset="7159383">First, petitioners' fraudulent activities obstructed the REA's ability to accomplish its own official functions in this case, and that included supervising Seminole Electric to insure that statutory objectives were met, that federal monies were not wasted, and to protect the substantial federal investment in this federal project, over $1.1 billion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3196.486" offset="12929728">With respect to the indictment and the jury charge, Justice Scalia, it was charged both a conspiracy to defraud the United States by defeating the lawful functions and Seminole Electric, and the jury was so charged with respect to both.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.261" offset="12992840">Indeed, in the Court of Appeals, the majority opinion when we raised the question of the sufficiency of the evidence on mail fraud, the Court of Appeals' opinion at page 14 of the Appendix to the Petition for Writ, they conceded that they were sustaining the mail fraud convictions because... should be affirmed if the evidence establishes the use of the malls in connection with Section 371 in violation of count one.</text>

            <text syncTime="3239.515" offset="13101823">Just because it is in conjunction you have to prove all of it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.150" offset="13116347">I mean, I accuse you of conspiracy to kill three people and I only prove that you conspired to kill two people, you walk free, is that the way the world works?</text>

            <text syncTime="3254.274" offset="13160859">Where the indictment here charged, and the jury was instructed that the conspiracy consisted of both, Your Honor, as it did here, then the charge made by the mail fraud charge was bound up in the conspiracy to defraud the United States and both, we submit, had to be proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.471" offset="13249676">The second point with respect to 371, the government is seeking to have this Court extend the provisions of Section 371 to an intermediary acting on behalf of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.698" offset="13302547">That phrase does not appear in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.315" offset="13312996">That phrase does not appear in any prior opinion of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.784" offset="13334939">The government relies on the Dixon case where a closely divided Court looked to the legislative history and found because of that legislative history, it would uphold the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.575" offset="13382064">Here there is simply no legislative history by which this Court can look and extend Section 371.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.365" offset="13409232">In such instance, we suggest it more appropriate to apply the rule of Lenete and say that a criminal defendant who is charged and convicted under statute about which he has no knowledge, the conviction should be reversed.</text>
