            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text>We will hear arguments next in No. 86-133, James Patrick Nollan against California Coastal Commission.</text>
            <text>Mr. Best, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>This case presents the issue of the scope of protection under the just compensation clause, where the right of the Nollan family to exclude others from the property surrounding their family home on the coast of California.</text>
            <text>The case comes to you on an appeal from a decision by the California Court of Appeal which overturned favorable judgments for the Nollans.</text>
            <text>The trial court had ruled, after a review of the facts of the case, that the Nollans intended action to replace one single family residential structure with a new, larger family home would have no effect on the public's access to and around the beach in the area of their home; and therefore, could not justify the imposition on the Nollans of the requirement placed by the California Coastal Commission that they dedicate an accessway covering approximately one-third of their property, for public use.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Best, may I ask you to address a preliminary question that is troubling me.</text>
            <text>The allegation of California is that the Nollans went ahead during the litigation and rebuilt the house, and that under California law, that amounts to a waiver of their right to challenge the constitutionality of the permit.</text>
            <text>How is that dealt with below?</text>
            <text>And what is your response to that problem?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>The issue was never raised below, Justice O'Connor, so it was not decided by the courts below in this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Was the construction... is it a fact that the construction was carried out pending this litigation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>Yes.</text>
            <text>The house was constructed without the permit.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Was that after the matter was heard by the Court of Appeal in the California courts?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>The construction was going on during the time this case was on appeal.</text>
            <text>And our point here, on that particular argument, is that the presentation by the Attorney General and our response to that in our... our response to the second motion to dismiss is, that that is not California law; that what California law provides--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, what do you expect us to do?</text>
            <text>To decide the California law question here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>--No, I don't believe it's necessary to decide that question here, because I think California law on the point is very clear.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, we'd have to decide that then.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>I don't believe so.</text>
            <text>I guess to the extent, if this Court believes there is a question as to whether or not a waiver of a right to follow a judicial proceeding has occurred.</text>
            <text>Our point is that the courts below have already decided that point, and the courts have said that mandamus is always available.</text>
            <text>There was a recent California Supreme Court decision in the Candid Enterprises case, which is cited in our response, where the Court essentially dealt with the same issue and expressly said that, although a waiver may occur as to past expenditures, as to damages that had occurred, preceding... in reliance... not challenging the permit, that the remedy of mandamus is always available.</text>
            <text>And that has been California's proceeding all along the line.</text>
            <text>Otherwise, without the remedy, you put the permit applicant in essentially this problem of having to swallow an unconstitutional provision.</text>
            <text>And one of the things that were very... concerning us, in terms of the argument that is being made by the Attorney General here, is to suggest that the permit processes may be used as an exaction mechanism without regard to the facts of the case, because it shifts the whole burden onto the property owner.</text>
            <text>Whenever the government wants a piece of property, if they're lucky enough to have jurisdiction over the owner for any reason where a regulatory permit is involved--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>You would agree, wouldn't you, Mr. Best, that your client proceeds at his peril in this respect; that if he loses here, he's then bound by the California Coastal Commission requirement?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>--Absolutely, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>He must... if this case... if the decision of the Court of Appeal is not reversed, the Nollans are obligated to make the dedication of the property for the public right of way.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Could you tell me precisely what the access right would be?</text>
            <text>Is it just across the rear of your property?</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>That's correct--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>It's not through... from outside your property down to the beach?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>--No, it is not an access from the road to the beach.</text>
            <text>It is an access along the beach.</text>
            <text>The Commission--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>It's between the high water mark and what?</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And how far is that?</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>There's some dispute as to how far it is.</text>
            <text>But according to the property records that exist at this time, we're talking about approximately 35 feet.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And that is... and you have title to that?</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>The Nollans have title to that.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And if... if... if you lose the case, then people may not only cross... cross that piece, but they could just use it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>No.</text>
            <text>The dedication provision is for pass and repass rights, which means the public can walk back and forth and use the beach for tide pooling, for getting... if they're surfing, to take their surfboards along, and so forth.</text>
            <text>But it would not allow them, for example, to engage in recreational activity.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>They couldn't set up their beach chair there, and sit in it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>In theory, that's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>But as a practical matter, if the public has access, your ability to go out and say, well, sure you can walk up and down, but you can't stand and talk, the Nollans feel that once the door is opened, the ability to interject any sort of effective control is going to be lost.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>They could surf there, too, I assume?</text>
            <text>That would be passing and repassing?</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Yes.</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>Yes, sir, they do surf there now.</text>
            <text>They can surf there without the accessway, and this is a popular surfing area.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, not when it's at high tide.</text>
            <text>What happens when--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>Well, surfers... as a surfer, they go in at the... at the open public access areas that exist a few hundred yards to the north, and a few hundred yards to the south of the Nollans' property.</text>
            <text>And then, of course, they can paddle their surfboards around any place, and surf where they can surf.</text>
            <text>And if they surf in, they turn around and go back out again.</text>
            <text>So it doesn't really have a significant impact currently.</text>
            <text>This is a very active surfing beach even without the access provision that's there, is the point I'm trying to make.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>--May I ask, Mr. Best, would it be a taking under your view of the case if they insisted on... if the regulation was not in the form it is, but said, you may not build a fence along the side to interrupt with the passage?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">

          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>We think there's a very important distinction with this case, is that it is not a regulation of use, as the prohibition on building anything would be a regulation on use.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>--Why is it different in practical effect from a prohibition against putting up a fence?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>It's different in a practical effect because what is happening is, you are actually transferring a property to the government, and other people are obtaining an interest in your property.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, that's a difference in legal effect.</text>
            <text>But what's the difference in practical effect, for a person living there?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>It's a difference in practical effect specifically in they have no... they lose their ability to go out and ask people not to be there.</text>
            <text>In other words--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>They don't lose their ability to ask people not to be there.</text>
            <text>If the people stop, as I understand it, they can ask them to please move on.</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>It seems to me that's the practical equivalent of a fence.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>--No, I think it's the opposite of a fence.</text>
            <text>In other words, if they were denied the ability to put up a fence, then they would not have a physical barrier, but they could still go out and say, don't cross, you know... don't cross the beach.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text>And there's clear that they're not going to approve that.</text>
            <text>And again, you see, that would be a regulation of use.</text>

            <text>And, again, you... again, the Nollans are not disputing that.</text>
            <text>And Justice Stevens, I want to go back to that and emphasize, the Nollans feel there is a big difference between being told... their being told not to do something on their property, and being told to allow somebody else to do something on their property.</text>
            <text>And whether that is being told not to put up a fence, or not to put up a sign, that... or being told not to build on the beach area, they concede that the state has that authority.</text>

            <text>If you do assign... put somebody on each end, you can't stop that man from coming in?</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>That's correct.</text>
            <text>A man can come in on the surf, and he can... because the tidelands are public.</text>
            <text>In other words, the lands up to the mean high tide are public, and surfers are free to ride in and turn around and go back out again without regard to this particular accessway.</text>
            <text>But I... let me explain to you why this is important to the Nollans.</text>
            <text>I think it's important to recognize this.</text>
            <text>Faria Beach is a variable beach.</text>
            <text>The sand washes in and the sand washes out.</text>
            <text>And there are admittedly times when it is not particular important to the Nollans to be able to exclude the public; times when, as some of the briefs have said, you have a rocky, relatively inhospitable area separated by a high seawall.</text>
            <text>But when the sand comes in, and there are pictures in the Joint Appendix at page 261 and 265, that shows you have a broad sandy beach with a relatively low seawall.</text>
            <text>And when you have that kind of a circumstance, then it isn't so much of a concern of the people who are walking across the... the foot 33, 34 and 35, right along the surf.</text>
            <text>The Nollans have no interest in excluding people from normal use of the beach.</text>
            <text>But this dedication is not just a few feet along the side of the tidelands.</text>
            <text>It goes all the way up to the seawall.</text>
            <text>And at times like that, people can walk along just a few feet from the Nollans' house.</text>
            <text>They can see over the seawall directly into their living area.</text>
            <text>They can reach over the seawall into the very small area that is left between their house.</text>
            <text>Now, as any parents of small children, that concerns them.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Best, the... the other side, California also argues that the state already effectively holds an easement by virtue of the California constitution.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>I cannot believe they made that argument, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>Again, in our reply brief, we point out that the constitutional provision has been... has been interpreted several times by the California Supreme Court and by several Courts of of Appeal, and it has never been interpreted... in fact, the Attorney General's own opinion on this matter says that these... that provision has never been interpreted to allow the public a right of access across private lands.</text>
            <text>I simply... and the case they cited in their brief do not stand for that proposition.</text>
            <text>In fact, those very cases reinforce that private land is private land.</text>
            <text>The Nollans' fee title is no less than anybody else's fee title.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, one would think that if that were the constitution of California, the Court of Appeal would have said something about it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>And you would think there would be no need for even asking for the exaction in the first place, because the right would already exist.</text>
            <text>The Commission had never believed that they had this right without this.</text>
            <text>The Commission made reference to maybe there are prescriptive rights, or maybe there was an implied dedication, although none of those matters were ever decided either by the Commission or the courts below, but never referred to the fact that we have an absolute right under the California constitution for access.</text>
            <text>I simply don't know where that argument came from.</text>
            <text>Now, on this case, we would like to emphasize that since it is not a regulation abuse, since what we are dealing with here is not a prohibition on the Nollans, and this property is stringently regulated.</text>
            <text>I mean, recognize this.</text>
            <text>You have a very small piece of property that is only allowed for single family residential use, and it is very stringently regulated in terms of health and safety standards as to what you can build there.</text>
            <text>And the Nollans are complying with all of that, and not challenging any of that.</text>
            <text>This is not really a land use issue, in the sense that nobody's asked to change the approved land use, a land use which has been in effect for over half a century.</text>
            <text>What the question here is, in essence, the coastal development permit is another building permit, a second level building permit, in addition to the one the Nollans had to acquire from the county and local governments.</text>
            <text>So the controlling factor in a takings analysis when applied to this type of case is the character of the governmental action being involved here; the fact that, indeed, what we have here is the government engaged in an acquisition program.</text>
            <text>There is an established state program to develop a roadway along the beach.</text>
            <text>It's set forth preliminary in the statute, and then the Commission, in its policy guidelines, adopted for the whole state, expressly says they're going to take this kind of an accessway from any kind of development, without regard to what it is, as long as it's not expressly exempted in the statute.</text>
            <text>The guidelines go so far as to say, look at the need for access, and look at the property's ability to give that access, and don't... don't look at what the property owner is doing when you decide to take that access.</text>
            <text>In the staff report, in making the decision, the Commission refers to the comprehensive program right at Faria Beach itself to obtain this kind of an accessway.</text>

            <text>The Commission has the power to deny that.</text>
            <text>And if they denied the rebuilding of it, then we would be here on a traditional regulatory takings case, if this Court had ever been interested in taking another traditional takings case.</text>
            <text>But that would be a denial of use.</text>
            <text>And this case does not dispute either the authority of the state to obtain an accessway along the coast if they want one, or the ability of the Commission to restrict use.</text>
            <text>What this case disputes is the ability of the state to obtain the accessway without condemning it by attaching the requirement that the accessway be given to them on a regulatory permit to which they're otherwise eligible.</text>

            <text>We have one lot, replacing the same use on the same lot.</text>
            <text>In a subdivision case, you're normally talking about multiple lots.</text>

            <text>Under our view of the takings clause, it's an ad hoc factual inquiry based on that case.</text>

            <text>Now this case is not... this Court has not decided specific case of this type before.</text>
            <text>And that's why we have analogized to the assessment cases in our opening brief, and suggested that one of the ways you can distinguish between the minimal type cases where... where the... have a minimal effect, and it would be a taking to impose an exaction, and the other types of cases is, by analyzing whether the property owner is creating a burden or not, and the exaction is solely for the purpose of relieving that burden.</text>
            <text>Here we have two problems.</text>
            <text>One is, it's clear on the record, nobody really denies that what the Commission is doing is taking the property.</text>
            <text>They want the property for a totally different purpose; nothing to do with what they're building there.</text>

            <label>Ms. Andrea Sheridan Ordin</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>Contrary to the argument, we do believe that this is another traditional regulatory taking case before this Court.</text>
            <text>Before you is a fairly unremarkable condition which is allowed... which has been placed by the Coastal Commission on the granting of a permit for new development, granting really a sidewalk by the sea, allowing persons to pass and repass in that perhaps 10-foot area between the high mean tide and the tow of the seawall.</text>
            <text>The record is not entirely clear how tall that seawall is.</text>
            <text>Eight feet appears in the Solicitor General's record.</text>
            <text>Different figures appear in declarations.</text>
            <text>The pictures at the back of your Appendix, I think, make it very clear that in great part, all seawalls tend to be above the heads of all who walk along there.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, it has to depend on how much sand there happens to be in, doesn't it?</text>

          <turn speaker="andrea_sheridan_ordin">
            <label>Ms. Andrea Sheridan Ordin</label>
            <text>That's exactly right, and how much water there happens to be, as you recognize from those pictures also.</text>
            <text>It is an inhospitable, rocky shore, much of the time, with the water lapping or crashing against that seawall.</text>

          <turn speaker="andrea_sheridan_ordin">
            <label>Ms. Andrea Sheridan Ordin</label>
            <text>Yes, it is.</text>
            <text>Faria Trust Beach.</text>
            <text>And was once a... a larger trust which has now been broken into these smaller parcels and lots, each with single family dwellings or vacation homes.</text>
            <text>But here it was a permit by the Coastal Commission which was granted to build new development.</text>
            <text>The Coastal Commission didn't say, no, you may not build a house that is three times as large as the one that was there before.</text>
            <text>The Coastal Commission did not say, you may not have a two-story house here which will block visual access, which will cause the types of burdens that we sere in the record below.</text>
            <text>The Coastal Commission after taking evidence, and of course with some help from the trial court who sent it back to the Coastal Commission to take some more evidence, did then decide that they would impose the least restrictive of all permit conditions; and that is, the... the pass and repass conditions.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Ms. Ordin, does the Coastal Commission contend here that the pass and repass easement is necessitated in anyway by the change in the house that's going to be on the property?</text>

            <label>Ms. Andrea Sheridan Ordin</label>
            <text>Yes.</text>
            <text>The individual house, perhaps in and of itself, would not be sufficient to cause that type of burden.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="andrea_sheridan_ordin">
            <label>Ms. Andrea Sheridan Ordin</label>
            <text>The... oh, the burden on the visual access to the coast.</text>
            <text>As you can see in the administrative record, there are studies, and there are... studies not only of this tract but other... other tracts which show that one of the purposes behind the Coastal Act was to allow the public to have access to its own public lands.</text>
            <text>And one of the most important areas has been the area to see that land; to know that your public beach is there; and be able to get there.</text>
            <text>And so--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>So this case then turns on whether such a reasonable relationship exists?</text>

            <label>Ms. Andrea Sheridan Ordin</label>
            <text>--The crux... I do believe it may be two-part analysis.</text>
            <text>But the very first analysis is exactly as Your Honor suggests; that indeed, we look to see if theta has been a rational and reasonable relationship or nexus between the harm being sought to be obviated and the nature of the action.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And so some might think that the state is limited in its concern about the visual burden to regulations that limit the height of the structure or the size of it.</text>
            <text>But you say it goes beyond that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrea_sheridan_ordin">
            <label>Ms. Andrea Sheridan Ordin</label>
            <text>That's right.</text>
            <text>Because, again, reasonable and rational does not mean exactitude.</text>
            <text>And here, we are looking at all of the burdens on access.</text>
            <text>And one of the access, because it happens to be visual, is the burden, access along the beachfront and the walking is a way of compensating.</text>
            <text>There could have been other ways.</text>
            <text>He could have--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, I... I might be inclined to think that the reasonable nexus would be limited to regulations of the size, location and so forth of the structure itself.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrea_sheridan_ordin">
            <label>Ms. Andrea Sheridan Ordin</label>
            <text>--That might be an analysis that the legislation would have... would have determined.</text>
            <text>Our legislature did not.</text>
            <text>And in fact, that kind of analysis might lead--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But if that... if the reasonable relationship or the nexus is part of the constitutional balance, then that's something the court has to be concerned about as well.</text>

            <text>Absolutely.</text>
            <text>Great deference, clearly to the legislative body; but absolutely, that is right.</text>
            <text>I would like to point out that time... not time and place, but size and place of the structure might very well be a much more substantial taking in the generic sense than anything like walking along the beach.</text>
            <text>If in fact we had denied the permit altogether, or if in fact we said, you may not build a second story, certainly many, many homeowners would say that that was much more obstructive and much more intrusive into their private rights.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Yes, but, Ms. Ordin, may I follow up on Justice O'Connor's question?</text>
            <text>The burden here is on visual access of the beautiful ocean and the shore.</text>
            <text>It seems to me you've alleviated that harm.</text>
            <text>It seems to me you might argue, had you given... required vertical access, you might say, well, they can park the bus and get out and walk to the beach and therefore see what they otherwise couldn't see.</text>
            <text>That might be related.</text>
            <text>But how does horizontal access respond to the particular burden you've described?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrea_sheridan_ordin">
            <label>Ms. Andrea Sheridan Ordin</label>
            <text>Access, we say, and have said through the statutes and through the regulations, is a term which includes ability to enjoy the beach.</text>
            <text>And there are many ways that you are forbidden from enjoying that beach.</text>
            <text>Congrestion, lack of parking lots, the inability to see the beach, private dwellings; a whole variety of areas.</text>
            <text>So it is the larger picture of access that we are trying to fix.</text>
            <text>And we have made that judgment that insofar as access, the visual access, has been cut off, and other burdens that this house may place on the... on the public, that we look to ways to compensate.</text>
            <text>And you can compensate it by vertical access is good.</text>
            <text>No, I... I--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Because this serves entirely different people.</text>
            <text>That is, the people who drive by in the bus still can't see the shore, but at least there'll be some other people, surfers or whoever, who can walk a long the wall and look into this fellow's house.</text>
            <text>Of course it may be, there won't be anybody.</text>
            <text>It may be that his two neighbors aren't subject to this passage requirement.</text>
            <text>And so nobody can cross their property, and hence, nobody can cross this fellow's except his two neighbors.</text>
            <text>Big gain.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrea_sheridan_ordin">
            <label>Ms. Andrea Sheridan Ordin</label>
            <text>--Well, we are not talking about big gain or small gain or good or bad.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>We certainly aren't, you're right.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrea_sheridan_ordin">
            <label>Ms. Andrea Sheridan Ordin</label>
            <text>What we are talking about is the upholding of a regulatory scheme which is designed to make gains, and has done it very slowly, and very ponderously.</text>
            <text>And here we're hopeful that the conditions will be held to be a reasonable exercise of the police power.</text>
            <text>The... whether the half a mile away a bus stop would be reasonable would differ among... among various municipalities.</text>
            <text>Certainly in many dedication cases, there are in lieu fees.</text>
            <text>Some of the state cases that we talk about in our brief, Remmenga is a payment in lieu, and then payment is mae somewhere else.</text>
            <text>That has traditionally been upheld by this Court as a rational, reasonable relationship.</text>
            <text>And so it might very well apply here.</text>
            <text>One of the arguments, of course, that has been made in the briefs is that there isn't sufficient information on tie taking issue in this... in this record for this Court to make a final decision.</text>
            <text>I would only submit to this Court that in fact, there is sufficient information.</text>
            <text>The Court of Appeal record here is definitely brief; there is no question about that.</text>
            <text>But I think we have to recognize that the Court of Appeal, when it did its taking analysis, came at the end of three other California cases, three of which this Court had not granted hearing.</text>
            <text>And therefore, the short analysis in the Court of Appeal of what the requirements of the Federal Constitution and the state constitution more than suffices to show that an adequate examination of this Court's cases in Loretto, this Court's cases in Penn Central, were analyzed and found not to be a taking.</text>
            <text>If there are no further questions--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="andrea_sheridan_ordin">
            <label>Ms. Andrea Sheridan Ordin</label>
            <text>No, there is not.</text>
            <text>And of course it is California's position that that was the burden of the Nollans.</text>
            <text>The Nollans had the opportunity and the ability to put some... some information into the record on the diminution of value, if any.</text>
            <text>It is our position, of course, that that diminution would be minimal, and certainly, in no way, reduces their reasonable expectations.</text>
            <text>They have value given to them by this permit.</text>
            <text>The ability to increase the value of their lot and their house by the structure; and whatever value might be put on it at some later time and some later place of this right to access, there is no showing that in any way they have been damaged financially.</text>

          <heading>Rebuttal of Robert K. Best</heading>
          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>I'll be brief, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>I'd like to address quickly two concessions made by counsel in her presentation, conceding that there must be the reasonable relationship test applied in this case, and also earlier, a concession that if the case is limited to an evaluation of the facts of the Nollans, she would concede that they were in trouble.</text>
            <text>So in essence what their argument is is that there must be a reasonable relationship test, but the reasonable relationship is between their legislative findings, or their statewide program, and what they are doing, and not on the facts of the case.</text>
            <text>And that's our fundamental concern here, is that this taking analysis should be performed on the facts of the case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But Mr. Best, let me just ask you right there.</text>
            <text>Suppose well in advance of this conveyance they had passed a law that said, there shall be no further development of property that improves... increases the interruption of visibility unless this action is granted.</text>
            <text>Just a flat rule across the board.</text>
            <text>Would you then say that each time a piece was granted, you have to test the particular property?</text>
            <text>Or could you test it on a general basis?</text>
            <text>I don't know is that question is clear or not.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>I think you could try to do it on a general basis.</text>
            <text>You're doing a facial challenge based on a taking and--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>No, no, my question is, if they can justify it as a whole, would that mean that any particular property owner could get in effect an exemption from it by saying, yes, but the reason for the rule really doesn't apply to my property, because I'm only slightly enlarging the house?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>--That would be our position, Your Honor, that they would have to have that exemption because of the takings clause.</text>
            <text>We can justify it in a police powers sense, and having a rational basis for what they're doing.</text>
            <text>But if the effect of that is to take the property, each individual property owner is entitled to show on the facts of his or her case that that would be the result.</text>
            <text>When you look at the facts of this case, they're relying on this visual access concept.</text>
            <text>You know, quite frankly, that's strictly a made-up proposition.</text>
            <text>In other words, they decided to take this access before it was remanded to them.</text>
            <text>And when it was remanded to them, they had to come up with a reason.</text>
            <text>But if you look at the facts of the case, if you look at the picture on page 267 of the Joint Appendix, you have a picture taken from the road across a one-story house almost... very similar to what used to exist on the Nollans' property, toward the ocean, and what do you see?</text>
            <text>You see no beach.</text>
            <text>You see no surf.</text>
            <text>You see no ocean.</text>
            <text>The fact of the matter is here, from the roadway, if you look at the beach, anything that is more than about six feet high, if that's how tall you are, blocks your view.</text>
            <text>There was no visual access with the old development on the property.</text>
            <text>Mr. Nollan submitted pictures in the record, and a declaration in which he described the pictures, and says, look it, I've stood at all these points and looked at the ocean and you can't see anything.</text>
            <text>It's just simply the Commission's legislative finding that anytime you build a bigger house you're going to block visual access which they're relying on.</text>
            <text>They won't look at the facts of the case.</text>
            <text>They won't look at what is happening to the Nollans.</text>
            <text>And I think that's a particular concern when we're dealing with a question of is there sufficient information in the record to make a decision in this case.</text>
            <text>The facts in this case are relatively simple, and they're all clearly in the record.</text>
            <text>You had a house that was there.</text>
            <text>It was being used for single family usage.</text>
            <text>It blocked all view of the ocean.</text>
            <text>The only thing the Nollans did was to build a bigger house.</text>
            <text>They had to go above the 10 percent, because as the trial court said in its original findings, 10 percent on the old house wasn't enough to add a decent closet to the house; and it would still be a house that was not acceptable for a family dwelling.</text>
            <text>And so the Nollans were caught.</text>
            <text>They were caught in a situation where they were a member of a trust before this permit process ever--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Was the house longer from side to side that it was?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_k_best">
            <label>Mr. Robert K. Best</label>
            <text>--Justice White, the house is bigger in all ways.</text>
            <text>It's wider, it's deeper, and it's taller.</text>
            <text>The reason it doesn't block view, though, is because in the older house there were fences that went out from the house to the property lines which blocked the view.</text>
            <text>And you couldn't see the beach, the sand, the surf or the ocean over the fences, either.</text>
            <text>And so, again, the point is, on the facts of this case, we have a taking.</text>
            <text>Thank you.</text>
