            <label>Mr. Jay M. Bloom</label>
            <text syncTime="10.092" offset="188995">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.981" offset="200489">This is a death penalty case arising out of Riverside County, California, and it involves the giving of an instruction at the penalty phase of that trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.150" offset="237165">Before getting into the instruction, I would like to lay out a little of the procedure, how the trial occurs in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.661" offset="267258">The California death penalty process is a two-step process.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.363" offset="282095">At the first step the jury determines the guilt or innocence of the defendant and determines the truthfulness of the special circumstances allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.219" offset="321488">The special circumstances allegation is used to narrow the category of first degree murderers who may receive the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.872" offset="352104">Once the jury determines the truthfulness of the special circumstances allegation, the case proceeds to the penalty phase where the jury may return a verdict of death or life without possibility of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.414" offset="402259">Now, in this case the evidence of the guilt phase showed that the defendant had raped and murdered a young, 15-year old girl and then called the parents to tell... called the mother to indicate she would never see her daughter alive again.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.767" offset="459728">The jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of murder in the first degree and rape, and as a special finding found the murder was premeditated.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.686" offset="495359">It also found as a special circumstance that the murder had occurred during commission of a rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.527" offset="518765">At the penalty phase the defendant presented evidence of remorse of a prior rape and evidence of sexual dysfunction and evidence from his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.915" offset="564322">The prosecution presented evidence of a prior rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.428" offset="578324">The jury fixed the punishment at death, after hearing three instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.552" offset="598804">The first instruction is the one that is at issue before this Court, and basically it says, you must not be swayed by mere sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, passion, prejudice, public opinion or public feeling.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.859" offset="656064">Both the people and the defendant have a right to expect that you will conscientiously consider and weigh the evidence and apply the law to the case, and that you will reach a just verdict regardless of what the consequences of such verdict may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.055" offset="716878">The jury was also instructed that they were to take into account and be guided by various aggravating and mitigating factors contained in instruction known as 8.84.1&gt; ["].</text>
            <text syncTime="153.957" offset="764420">That laid out the various aggravating and mitigating factors and also indicated the jury could consider any other circumstance which extenuated the gravity of the offense, even though not a legal excuse for the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.608" offset="814993">The jury was finally instructed with Caljic 8.84.2 which indicated the jury could consider, take into account, and be guided by the applicable factors of aggravation and mitigation upon which it had been instructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.273" offset="873717">The jury was then told, if the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors, it shall impose the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.474" offset="902556">However, if the mitigating factors outweighed the aggravating factors, it was to impose a punishment of life without possibility of parole.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="196.189" offset="933380">Mr. Bloom, where in the instructions was the jury told that it should consider mitigating evidence about the background and the character of the defendant?</text>

          <turn speaker="jay_m_bloom" startTime="207.060" stopTime="230.863">
            <label>Mr. Jay M. Bloom</label>
            <text syncTime="207.060" offset="976848">Well, it is our position, Your Honor, that Caljic 8.481 which deals with the various aggravating, mitigating factors, it discusses the jury is to consider the circumstances of the offense, prior violent conduct, any mental defects of the individual, and under the "K" section, any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the offense, even though not a legal excuse.</text>

            <text syncTime="231.832" offset="1075904">"any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime? "</text>

            <label>Mr. Jay M. Bloom</label>
            <text syncTime="236.174" offset="1093354">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.955" offset="1096384">The exact language, Your Honor, was</text>
            <text syncTime="238.565" offset="1102863">"any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime. "</text>

          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="245.560" stopTime="255.963">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="245.560" offset="1130866">And do you think that that makes it clear to the jury that they could consider evidence going to the background and character of the defendant?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jay_m_bloom" startTime="255.963" stopTime="441.592">
            <label>Mr. Jay M. Bloom</label>
            <text syncTime="255.963" offset="1172453">Yes, Your Honor, because in the first place this instruction tracks exactly penal code 190.3 which this Court discussed in California versus Ramos, and in that decision this Court indicated in footnote 19 of the opinion that the instruction allowed the jury to consider all evidence to show a penalty less than death was appropriate and met the standards of Lockett versus Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.359" offset="1278092">This Court also noted, citing to 190.3, that the California scheme like the Texas sentencing scheme insures the jury will hear all relevant mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.184" offset="1321351">Now, in addition, in Pulley versus Harris which dealt with the 1977 California law, this Court had occasion to also discuss 190.3, which was substantially the same language, and the Court indicated that the statute and the California system was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.036" offset="1396793">So, since the instruction given here tracks exactly 190.3, which in essence has been upheld by this Court in Ramos and Pulley versus Harris, to permit a defendant to present all relevant mitigating evidence, it is our position that the instruction does allow the jury to consider all the relevant evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.138" offset="1469204">Basically, what the position of the state in this case is, is the instruction telling the jury not to be swayed by mere sentiment, sympathy, conjecture; tells the jury, the best it can, to divorce itself from emotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.727" offset="1519568">What these factors are, are not mitigating factors but are motions of the jurors, as Justice Mosk indicated below in his dissent in the Lamphear decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.129" offset="1561155">And, when followed by Caljic 8.481, the jury then is to consider all the relevant mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.032" offset="1592711">This Court indicated in Gardner versus Florida that a motion has no place in decision to impose the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.997" offset="1616639">In addition, the Chief Justice, dissenting recently in Caldwell versus Mississippi, indicated,</text>
            <text syncTime="373.198" offset="1641403">"There is nothing wrong with urging a capital sentencing jury to disregard a motion and render a decision based on the law and the facts. "</text>
            <text syncTime="381.477" offset="1674526">He then said,</text>
            <text syncTime="382.586" offset="1678915">"I do not understand the Court to believe that motions in favor of mercy must play a part in the ultimate decision of a capital sentencing jury. "</text>
            <text syncTime="391.161" offset="1713292">"Indeed, much of our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence has been concerned with eliminating emotion from sentencing decisions. "</text>
            <text syncTime="398.407" offset="1742236">It is our position that what these instructions do is, the instruction telling the jury not to be swayed by sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, et cetera, tells the jury, put aside these emotions.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.293" offset="1785808">They have no place in determining life or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.089" offset="1796989">But what you are to do is to view the facts and the law as given to you in Caljic 8.84.1 and Caljic 8.84.2.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.695" offset="1831366">In addition, the emotions dealt with here, sympathy, sentiment and conjecture, aren't necessarily beneficial to the defendant as respondent alleges here.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.661" offset="1875251">Sentiment, sympathy and conjecture could just as likely be engendered for the victim, or just as likely be engendered against the defendant in a death penalty case.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="441.592" offset="1914958">If the word "sympathy" were out of the instruction, would you be here; the single word, "sympathy"?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jay M. Bloom</label>
            <text syncTime="447.543" offset="1938781">Well, I think we would be here because the court below indicated that the instruction as a whole is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.336" offset="1989981">It didn't deal just with sympathy.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.852" offset="1996042">It also dealt with the issue of just verdict and consequences of the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.492" offset="2014536">So, all these factors taken together, the Court indicated, were inappropriate for the jury to consider.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="473.660" offset="2043271">Mr. Bloom, may I follow up on a question that Justice O'Connor asked you about the adequacy of the instructions to take into consideration the mitigating evidence, and I have in mind particularly the argument of the prosecutor at the Joint Appendix at page 90 and 91 where he refers to the fact that they brought in a parade of relatives who talked about the background of the defendant as a child and then argued that that testimony was a blatant attempt by the defense to inject personal feelings in the case to make the defendant appear human, to make you feel for the defendant and so forth, but that the judge would in effect tell you that you must not be swayed by sympathy.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.049" offset="2212858">Doesn't that suggest that the judge was in effect directing the jury not to consider that kind of mitigating evidence?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jay_m_bloom" startTime="523.265" stopTime="552.880">
            <label>Mr. Jay M. Bloom</label>
            <text syncTime="523.265" offset="2241697">Well, no, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.671" offset="2247340">What he was telling the jury was to consider the facts and the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.467" offset="2262491">At the opening of his argument, for example, he says,</text>
            <text syncTime="531.309" offset="2273880">"You are not to consider sympathy, sentiment or any of these factors. "</text>
            <text syncTime="535.214" offset="2289449">But then he goes on and says,</text>
            <text syncTime="536.760" offset="2295614">"You are to consider the mitigating factors. "</text>
            <text syncTime="538.526" offset="2302719">and he goes through them and lists them.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.759" offset="2307630">That's the opening of the prosecutor's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.711" offset="2319438">Now, in addition he also notes at one point in his argument that the jurors are not to be swayed by sympathy for the victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.834" offset="2347963">They are to consider the facts and the law of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="625.509" offset="2650670">Now, the California Supreme Court in the Easley case did indicate that it felt that instruction dealt only with the offense and not the offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.428" offset="2686301">However, this Court as I indicated in the Ramos decision, indicated in footnote 19 that 190.3 of the penal code, which this instruction is a verbatim statement of that, does comport with Lockett and Eddings and allows the jury to consider all relevant mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.188" offset="2757354">So, my point is in essence that this Court has already upheld the validity of this instruction by upholding 190.3 because they are the exact same language.</text>

            <text syncTime="1291.586" offset="5314951">For example, if the defendant wanted to put on evidence that as a child he was dropped on his head and his parents beat him up, that's fine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1386.520" offset="5694667">In 1976 in Gregg versus Georgia this Court noted that the admission of relevant mitigating evidence under fair procedural rules is not alone sufficient to guarantee that the information will be properly used in the determination of punishment, especially if the sentencing is performed by a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.543" offset="5770735">Respondent here was allowed to put on all of his mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.119" offset="5793096">The problem was that he was denied the proper use of that evidence by the prosecutor's argument and the Court's instructions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1429.097" offset="5864985">Respondent put on a substantial amount of mitigating evidence at the penalty phase of his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.766" offset="5891630">He put on several family members who testified that he was a quiet, loving youngster and young man, that he had been devastated at a very early age by the divorce of his parents and the separation from his father, and that he cared very much for his family members, keeping up relationships with them even while he was in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.524" offset="5962683">In addition, respondent presented the testimony of a psychiatrist who indicated that respondent had severe psychosexual problems, that they were based primarily on a grossly distorted sexual upbringing by his mother.</text>

            <text syncTime="1489.746" offset="6107611">He kept close relationships with family and friends, that his behavior was sexually and not violently motivated, and that he presented no danger in an all-male prison population.</text>

            <text syncTime="1503.679" offset="6163304">He echoed the pleas of his family members and asked the jury to show him mercy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.583" offset="6178977">At the end of all this evidence the judge instructed the jury in the instructions that Mr. Bloom has indicated to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.501" offset="6218579">The prosecutor exploited these instructions in his argument by emphasizing the duty of the jury to follow the law as the Court would give it to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.091" offset="6256926">He argued that all the factors that the Court would list for them to consider were aggravating factors, that no mitigating evidence had been presented on any of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1594.376" offset="6526092">Respondent's position is that the anti-sympathy instruction alone is unconstitutional in all circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.389" offset="6554200">But I really believe that the issue before this Court can be and is much narrower than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.246" offset="6577606">That is, this is really a straightforward Lockett case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.713" offset="6587428">Respondent put on a lot of mitigating evidence and yet nothing in the instructions that were given to the jury adequately told them that they could consider that mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.116" offset="6629119">In fact, the instructions really told them that they couldn't consider that mitigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.098" offset="6645002">That was the argument of the prosecutor, and if the prosecutor understood and interpreted that instruction that way, it certainly is likely that at least one if not more of the jurors understood the instruction in that way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1879.752" offset="7667643">The last part of it is... the residual clause is,</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.187" offset="7693348">"Any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1902.697" offset="7759385">But, as was pointed out by the state in its argument, a jury wouldn't reasonably understand it that way since before Subsection K a lot of the other subsections specifically mention factors that have nothing to do narrowly with the commission of the crime, such as whether there was any prior felony conviction, whether... how old was he, and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2936.431" offset="11894360">Maybe so, but the whole penalty decision cannot be a totally rational, objective decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.711" offset="11923408">It is a very subjective, discretionary decision by its nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.443" offset="11942425">We cannot make it totally rational.</text>

            <text syncTime="2953.862" offset="11964055">--Well, but to try with an anti-sympathy instruction is essentially to tilt the scale towards death for a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.438" offset="11994357">Yes, it is possible that if you allow the jury to consider sympathy, that some jurors will have sympathy for the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.888" offset="12020166">I think that happens whether you allow the jury to consider sympathy or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.825" offset="12035944">But in the end, it's all the capital defendants have going for them at the penalty trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.118" offset="12057051">They get to the penalty stage of the capital proceeding because they have been convicted of a very serious crime that is essentially an unmitigated crime, that as Justice Groden in the Brown opinion noted, that the issue is not really between good and bad, is this defendant a good man or is he a bad man, do we give him death or life based on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.234" offset="12141583">The fact of the matter is that we are dealing with very serious offenders who generally have very serious criminal backgrounds, that the only thing that they have going for them in terms of getting the jury to opt for a decision of life is a sympathetic response to their evidence in the hope that they will exercise mercy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.024" offset="12216711">Respondent literally staked his life on the hope that the jury would do that in this case, that they would listen to his evidence, that they would consider it, that they would have a sympathetic response to it, and that they would exercise mercy for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.614" offset="12267075">And yet, the instructions given in the case which were clearly aggravated by the prosecutor's argument... but the instructions given told the jury that they could not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.874" offset="12308140">Respondent might as well have sat mute at the penalty phase for all the good putting on all his evidence did.</text>

            <text syncTime="3055.166" offset="12369266">As long as it's clear to the jury that factors such as sympathy, compassion and mercy can be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.383" offset="12394135">And the reason I say that I would allow for the exclusion of emotion is because there are some emotions such as prejudice, for example, which clearly should not play a part in the jury's determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3081.359" offset="12474069">It's the very basis for a decision such as findings, that if you eliminate compassion, if you eliminate the types of things that we're talking about, defendants at a penalty trial have absolutely no chance at all of getting a life verdict out of their jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="3110.894" offset="12592143">I think that one of the things that is rather telling about this instruction is that the instruction was developed for the guilt phase of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.733" offset="12643552">In fact, the use note in the standard Caljic, the book of jury instructions in California, specifically tells judges not to give it at a penalty trial.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jay M. Bloom</label>
            <text syncTime="3146.507" offset="12734667">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.016" offset="13328691">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.601" offset="12739055">May it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.023" offset="12744698">With regard to the issue of sympathy, I think it must be considered that at the penalty phase when this instruction is being given, the defendant has already presumably been convicted of murder in the first degree, and a special circumstance of some sort has been found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.970" offset="12804466">So, under these circumstances to believe necessarily that sympathy would be helpful to a defendant, I think is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.341" offset="12833932">I think that if anything, as indicated in the briefs, sympathy is likely to be engendered the other way against the defendant in favor of the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.713" offset="12867473">So, for this reason it seems eminently reasonable and fair to everybody involved to tell the jury, put aside these gut reactions the best you can; decide the case on the facts and the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.568" offset="12918882">Now, with regard to the prosecutor's argument, I wanted to invite the Court's attention if I could to page 6524 of the reporter's transcript, and this is the opening of his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.157" offset="12969246">He says,</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.751" offset="12971650">"Remember, during the voir dire I told you that the Court would not leave you adrift to your own feelings to decide which of the two punishments should be imposed. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.202" offset="13005400">"The Court would provide you with guidelines, instructions to make these decisions, and indeed this will happen. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.669" offset="13031313">"The Court will instruct you in determining the penalty to be imposed. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.323" offset="13045942">"You shall consider all the evidence which has been received during any part of the trial. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.351" offset="13066004">"You shall consider, take into account and be guided by the following factors. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.006" offset="13084603">He then goes through the various "A" through "K" factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.458" offset="13098396">So, even though he starts out saying, I want you to put aside your emotions as I told you, he then says, go ahead and view the evidence, which is precisely what he's supposed to be doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.204" offset="13137475">In addition, I think the instruction must be viewed as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.578" offset="13158895">I think that respondent's brief narrowed the Court too much onto the issue of sympathy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.530" offset="13178749">The other words are crucial here:</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.903" offset="13188257">"You must not be swayed by mere sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, but you will conscientiously consider and weigh the evidence and apply the law of the case, and that you will reach a just verdict. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.540" offset="13234755">In other words, the best you can, put everything aside with regard to emotion, carefully weigh the facts and the law, and render a just and fair verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.161" offset="13273207">We believe that the State of California, consistently with the Ramos decision and the Eighth Amendment, may ask the jury to render a just verdict based on the facts and the law, and for that reason the judgment of the California Supreme Court should be reversed.</text>
