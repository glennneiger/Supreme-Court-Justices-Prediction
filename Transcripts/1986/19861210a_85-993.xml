            <label>Mr. Walter E. Carson</label>
            <text syncTime="14.374" offset="184393">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is not a factually complex case.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.080" offset="215218">However, it is a case that will have profound effects on the free exercise rights of all Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.519" offset="248968">The issues to be addressed by the appellate in this case are threefold.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.756" offset="273941">First, this case is controlled by the Court's decisions in Sherbert, 374 US, and Thomas, 450 US, and is factually indistinguishable from those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.349" offset="328276">Secondly, the basis that unemployment compensation was denied to Paula Hobbie, that basis being misconduct, creates a vehicle, a mechanism, if you will, whereby the state of Florida can discriminate against individuals because of their religious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.327" offset="404135">And finally, both the free exercise clause and the establishment clause ask that the courts and the laws of this land accommodate a person's religious practices and beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.487" offset="464844">Moving to the first phase of our argument, Your Honor, the case, as we indicated, is factually and legally indistinguishable from the Court's decisions in Sherbert and Thomas, and I would like to lay before the Court briefly the facts of those cases so that the Court can appreciate the similarities.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.116" offset="531300">Paula Hobbie had worked for Lawton Jewelers for approximately two and one-half years.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.019" offset="558989">At that time she was converted to the teachings of the Seventh Day Adventist Church.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.506" offset="580932">As such she was convicted that the Sabbath, that period from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday, was a holy day and was a special day.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.629" offset="621370">She reached these convictions and they were sincerely held.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.433" offset="636625">She brought this information to the attention of her employer and her immediate supervisor and she worked out an accommodation, an arrangement whereby she worked for him on Sundays and in turn he worked for her on Friday evenings and during the Sabbath hours on Saturday.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.477" offset="708828">This arrangement worked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.094" offset="715202">It was, at least according to the immediate supervisor, an acceptable arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.548" offset="737040">When upper management learned of this accommodation they put a stop to it immediately, gave Paula Hobbie the choice of her job or her religious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.872" offset="786359">She refused to give up her religious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.158" offset="799525">She refused to resign.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.926" offset="806526">And she in fact was fired by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.295" offset="820005">She applied for unemployment compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.747" offset="829827">The employer objected, the state agreed, and she was denied unemployment compensation for misconduct associated with her work.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.520" offset="868906">She took an appeal to the Fifth District Appellate Court in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.839" offset="890222">The court there affirmed the Florida Unemployment Appeals Commission decision denying her unemployment compensation, and she has brought the case here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.064" offset="935153">There are a number of factual and legal parallels between Hobbie and this Court's decisions in Sherbert and Thomas.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.753" offset="969843">Hobbie, like Sherbert and Thomas, was denied unemployment compensation by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.324" offset="996175">Hobbie, like Sherbert and Thomas, was asked or forced to choose between her religion and/or her work.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.798" offset="1038075">Hobbie, like Sherbert and Thomas, was put into a situation where work once acceptable for religious reasons became objectionable, and because of those changed conditions she was no longer able to work during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.308" offset="1104113">And in Hobbie just as in Sherbert and Thomas the state once again has brought pressure to bear on her to modify her religious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.449" offset="1148625">The holding in Sherbert and Thomas reached an important, we believe, milestone in free exercise jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.572" offset="1189167">The compelling state interest standard was applied to the free exercise of religion, and we believe that that same standard applies here in this case, that the state of Florida cannot burden Paula Hobbie's religious beliefs unless it is able to show that a compelling state interest exists and justifies such a burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.241" offset="1299822">There is one unique aspect in the Hobbie case that was not before the Court in Sherbert or in Thomas, and of course that is the defense that was raised by the state, the agent of change.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.000" offset="1358859">The agent of change theory suggests that because Paula Hobbie converted and adopted her religious practices after she began her employment, that that act of conversion, that act which is so fundamental to a free exercise right, distinguishes her situation from Sherbert and from Thomas and thus disqualifies her from entitlements to the benefits under the state's unemployment compensation program.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.936" offset="1474633">We would suggest that such a distinction is not a valid one and that the principles in Sherbert and Thomas should control.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.125" offset="1511414">To allow the agent of change to become a defense would in effect deny a person at any time from converting to new religious beliefs and practices, and of course that right of conversion, that right to adopt a new religion, is fundamental and central to the free exercise clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="369.907" offset="1606500">Supposing that instead of being converted to a new religion she had acquired some physical disability that made it impossible for her to continue her work.</text>

            <text syncTime="790.331" offset="3288158">I would touch next, Your Honors, on the misconduct standard used by the state of Florida to deny benefits to Paula Hobbie.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.257" offset="3339881">I would... in my argument I would suggest that the misconduct standard is not unlike the good cause standard that Members of the Court have found persuasive creating a situation or a mechanism, if you will, for individualized exemptions under the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.921" offset="3430578">Misconduct, of course, has a negative sense or meaning to it, and as I have mentioned already there are cases that were cited in the Solicitor General's brief that I have mentioned to the Court that would suggest that misconduct has been applied against Paula Hobbie in terms of her religious beliefs and practices, but that same standard has been rejected by the courts in Florida in a situation where an individual was in jail and missed work and yet his jail absence did not constitute misconduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1139.258" offset="4683933">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the state of Florida disagrees that Sherbert and Thomas are controlling in this case, at least to the extent that there is a difference between those cases and this case, a difference which would mean if those precedents were followed here it would be an expansion of the principle of law announced in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.975" offset="4782780">To briefly describe these differences, the Sherbert case dealt with a slightly different kind of penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.646" offset="4813500">Under the unemployment compensation laws there are ineligibility penalties which a person must meet certain standards, and in this case her standard was the availability for work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.604" offset="4861252">She wasn't available for work because of her religious status and the nature of the job market where she had traditionally worked made her unavailable as construed by the South Carolina Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.233" offset="4923842">Hobbie, on the other hand, was found disqualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.017" offset="4934917">This penalty would be removed after she becomes reemployed and earns a certain amount of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.188" offset="4963652">The next time she filed a claim for benefits unless she became unemployed under similar circumstances she would be qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.592" offset="4989252">It is not a status situation like... in Sherbert's case every time she filed her claim, as long as she held that religion and lived in that community she would have been ineligible.</text>

            <label>Mr. John D. Maher</label>
            <text syncTime="1877.040" offset="7635038">Probably so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.259" offset="7643920">One example that does involve the religion clause, the parochial schools, the courts held that we cannot abolish or interfere with the operation of parochial schools, but then again we are not allowed to provide incentives to promote parochial schools, and that cases like Meek v. Pettinger and Woolman v. Walter have tried to basically keep the government away from religious schools and religion away from public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.765" offset="7781951">Probably the best example of a parallel between the situation here and a case decided by this Court was that of Johnson v. Robison or Robeson in which a veterans, while he wasn't a veteran, he was a conscientious objector who did not serve during the war, applied for Veterans Administration benefits, which he would have been entitled to had he participated in the war, and the courts... the Court held that such benefits were inappropriate, that the government could provide benefits only to certain persons who met certain requirements, and that the religion, even though he did this solely based upon his religious convictions, he could not use that to force the Veterans Administration to pay benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.900" offset="7994483">Similarly in the Bob Jones University case where a tax exemption was denied on the basis of racial discrimination, the Court denied awarding that exemption solely because this was a religious institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.576" offset="8061148">Finally, perhaps the most well-known example of this Court's refusal to deny a government the opportunity to uniformly apply a law was the Sunday closing cases of Brunfield v. Brown and McGowan v. Maryland, also, we would submit, the United States v. Lee on Social Security benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.894" offset="8158428">All of these cases indicate that the government can do certain things which have impact on religion and not have to carve out a specific exception.</text>

            <text syncTime="2023.653" offset="8221435">Wisconsin v. Yoder I think is the example of where the line should be drawn, where there is a very strong coercive impact between the government regulation and the religious practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.080" offset="8275143">Yoder would have required these school children to attend school daily, in conflict with their religious teaching, a very coercive thing to go through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.186" offset="8319655">The alternative to that was to commit a crime under the local ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.755" offset="8341912">The impact here is not nearly related to that... nearly that strong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.842" offset="8362287">This statute does not regulate working on Sundays or Saturdays.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.980" offset="8382767">It doesn't regulate... such as Estate of Thurston v. Caldwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.301" offset="8408054">It doesn't regulate directly like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.201" offset="8415682">It is just a uniform unemployment compensation law that does not carve out an exception for people like Hobbie.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.442" offset="8452671">And Florida has taken the position that it doesn't need to, that it shouldn't be required to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.596" offset="8485272">The question here that was asked earlier about would we apply this to other secular situations, I submit that if a person refused on work on Saturday, not one Saturday but all Saturdays, it would be held to be misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.092" offset="8567192">The cases that were cited suggesting remand were those dealing with one-time situations that were related to personal reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.817" offset="8610137">In Langley a cook didn't comply with the chef's instructions because his father had had a heart attack, one occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.840" offset="8646186">The commission had held, and affirmed by the courts, that this was not misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.077" offset="8667188">But this was not to say he was going to refuse to work all future Saturdays or whatever, just one occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.580" offset="8693206">In Parker, the man was incarcerated but not convicted of anything, and that is what the state court held, that there was no showing that he did anything wrong, so no culpability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.871" offset="8738346">And in Hartenstein, the third case that was cited, the man merely requested time off to attend a funeral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.525" offset="8764991">I mean, these were all very short-lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.977" offset="8778784">To show other secular examples of state court opinions, in Slusher v. State, 354 Southern 2nd 450, the state of Florida held that a woman whose husband's job is transferred out of state and who quits to relocate with him is disqualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.246" offset="8891842">That is obviously a compelling personal reason who would be disqualified under Florida law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.067" offset="8915143">Another case, Beard, which is cited in the state's brief on the merits, a woman who quit employment because of a shift change, which she initially agreed to, conflicted with her ability to care for two teenage dependents held disqualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.946" offset="8986614">And in City of Riviera Beach v. Department of Commerce, 372 Southern 2nd 1000, a woman who took time off from work without permission to spend more time adjusting to her newly adopted child was held disqualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.205" offset="9051711">So we are not singling out religion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.407" offset="9060488">These are all personal reasons of a compelling nature that Florida has decided, unlike some states, to exclude, not exclude, but fail to include personal reasons as good cause for either quitting or conflict with employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.969" offset="9126735">Now, the probably most recent examples of the courts looking at this issue came up in the Bowen v. Roy, dealing with the Social Security program, in which an Indian objected to having their infant daughter assigned and ultimately the use of a number, Social Security number, and this Court refused to force the administration to make special accommodations to changes in its procedures in order to make an exception for Little Bird in the Snow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.266" offset="9323907">A similar refusal to make an exception occurred in Goldman v. Weinberger, in which an Air Force captain wished to have the Air Force give an exception that would permit him to wear a yarmulke while on duty in unfair, and this Court refused to compel the Air Force to make an exception in his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.500" offset="9428919">And that is what this case boils down to, is whether Hobbie is entitled to an exception that would force the state of Florida to change its unemployment compensation program to basically accommodate her religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.680" offset="9509585">The state submits that that does not in some of the more recent opinions of the Court constitute a violation of the establishment clause but it certainly closes the distance leading to a collision between those clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.475" offset="9580743">Respecting an establishment of religion and carving out statutory exceptions to accommodate religion are getting very close, and we would submit that if Court were to expand Sherbert and Thomas to encompass this case, then it would be moving in that direction of a collision with the establishment clause, a direction which we do not feel is well advised.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="2388.359" offset="9680322">Of course, depending on how we are interpreting the establishment clause you might like a collision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.811" offset="9702160">I mean, whether a collision is good or bad depends upon--</text>

            <text syncTime="2399.481" offset="9724834">It is something that needs to be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.250" offset="9731835">I see what you mean, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.035" offset="9739045">That is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.269" offset="9747926">But if that is the case, then the need is for the collision to be resolved somehow, and I submit it wasn't done in Sherbert, and that was a criticism in one of the concurring or dissenting opinions, that... where do you draw the line?</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.080" offset="9815218">And I think it is going to become a reconstruction or a retreat of the establishment clause, if that is to be the case, which it may be.</text>
