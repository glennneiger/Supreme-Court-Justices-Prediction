            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="22.363" offset="242984">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="25.965" offset="257299">The issue in this case is whether Article 15 of the agreement in implementation of Article 3 of the Panama Canal Treaty exempts from United States taxation income received by U.S. citizens for work performed for the Panama Canal Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.577" offset="319784">Petitioners are United States employees of the Commission who seek refunds of income taxes paid for various years since 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.897" offset="349041">The Claims Court, in a thorough and thoughtful opinion by Chief Judge Koninski, held the Petitioners are entitled to a tax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.753" offset="380493">The Federal Circuit, relying in some measure upon a diplomatic note from Panama, then recently supplied by the Government at the Circuit Court level, reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.775" offset="416542">Petitioners submit that the Claims Court correctly interpreted the implementing agreement on the basis of its plain language, its structure, and the negotiating history, and therefore we seek reversal of the judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.750" offset="464503">Analysis of the implementing agreement obviously must begin with the plain language used by the signatories, as that language is understood in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.872" offset="496999">The language, we submit, is strikingly favorable to Petitioners, and provides in relevant part:</text>
            <text syncTime="91.141" offset="518001">"United States employees shall be exempt from any taxes, fees, or other charges on income received as a result of their work for the Commission. "</text>
            <text syncTime="99.697" offset="552274">No reference appears in that language to Panamanian taxes, and it stands is stark contrast to the other two paragraphs of Article 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.435" offset="583203">This language also differs significantly from parallel language in Article 16 of the agreement in implementation of Article 4 of the Panama Canal Treaty, which concerns members of the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.327" offset="630746">That provision, which the Government has acknowledged was the model for this one, contains a specific reference to Panamanian law.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.647" offset="660108">That reference was deleted, for reasons that are not altogether clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.800" offset="676721">But the inference to be drawn from that has been made clear by this Court's decisions both in Air France and in Santo Vicenzo that the deletion of language, of parallel language, has meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.257" offset="718517">And the meaning in this instance we submit was to exempt United States citizens from taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.096" offset="745894">Based on that plain meaning argument, the natural question that will necessarily arise is, why would United States negotiators agree to exempt United States employees from the taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.868" offset="788943">I think in order to understand that you have to go back to the political climate in 1977 and the circumstances surrounding these negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.658" offset="824157">The Carter Administration was deeply committed to an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.628" offset="840039">The question of giving up the canal was no longer a matter of internal debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.680" offset="856235">The only thing left were the circumstances under which that canal would be transferred back to Panama.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.568" offset="879745">The basic question was under what circumstances Panama would receive back the Panama, and Panama would not receive back that canal, which is made clear through the negotiating history, except on terms that demonstrated clearly Panamanian sovereignty over the Canal Zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.795" offset="952679">Unfortunately, we do not have the exact exchanges that led up to the final agreement of Article 15, paragraph 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.282" offset="978592">Nevertheless, it is quite clear from the exchanges among the various ministers with the United States negotiators that Panama would not lightly recede from its position that it should be allowed to tax United States citizens who were working for the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.792" offset="1036689">The reason it sought to tax United States citizens who were working for the Commission... excuse me, in the Commission... was that that was a reflection of its sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.647" offset="1076081">The United States, on the other hand, never viewed the issue as a matter of tax policy, but merely as a political problem to be solved.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.801" offset="1104712">The United States could not allow Panama to tax United States citizen employees of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.657" offset="1132088">It would create an untoward precedent, which would in turn adversely affect the negotiating posture of the United States in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.013" offset="1165525">In addition, the internal memoranda of the Government make it abundantly clear that there was fear by the negotiators that if they acceded to the Panamanian request to tax these corrects, that the consequences in Congress would be rather significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.571" offset="1223725">The opposition was going to be quite clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.507" offset="1443468">It says, "Similarly", that these things are taxed.</text>

            <text syncTime="349.808" offset="1552764">The primary concerns of the negotiators were the sovereignty over the Commission, and so the bilateral agreement not to tax any income either directly or indirectly arising out of work for the Commission was the primary purpose of the agreement and the compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.983" offset="1613472">The fact that they may have left open one potential for U.S. citizen employees... and this is clearly going to be a very small subset of people who are U.S. citizen employees--</text>

            <text syncTime="801.024" offset="3357616">And under the alternative, any other alternative interpretation of the second sentence that forces the United States... that allows the United Statesm to tax this income, you have to assume that the negotiators for Panama receded, they gave up, they caved, even though it had been described to the United States as essentially a treaty-buster if the sovereignty of Panama was not recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.853" offset="3448940">The debates leading up to the final agreement consistently... and most of them come from Minister Royo... indicate that they would not be able to reach an agreement unless the sovereign concerns of Panama were taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.161" offset="3498155">So that any other interpretation of Article 1 means that somewhere between the last messages we have on the subject and the final agreement, without any indication that Panama would give it up, had completely abandoned its interest in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.719" offset="3552385">It makes much more sense to assume that a compromise was reached, that the concerns of the negotiators for the United States were not based on tax policy; they were based on diplomatic and political concerns.</text>

            <text syncTime="1587.031" offset="6501610">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.447" offset="6511327">The question in this case is simply whether Petitioners have to pay federal income taxes, just like all the rest of us, or whether they alone among all the citizens employed by the United States Government and its agencies at home and abroad, they alone are exempt from United States taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.378" offset="6591053">Now, when we clear away the smoke and we put away the mirrors of Petitioners' argument, several simple points remain and they are dispositive of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.233" offset="6626370">The first is that when the language of the agreement is read in context Petitioners' construction is implausible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.572" offset="6659807">Second, the consistent and uniform construction of the executive branch is that there is no exemption from United States taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.178" offset="6694184">Third, the executive branch's view was authoritatively communicated to the Senate at the time of ratification on behalf of the offices of the State and Defense Departments that were responsible for negotiating and drafting the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.938" offset="6757192">The same position was adopted and restated in the Senate report, and the consistent administrative practice of every affected executive branch department... the State Department, the Department of Treasury, and the Internal Revenue Service... also reflects that same interpretation, namely no exemption from U.S. taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.268" offset="6834514">In addition to that, both governments that signed the treaty and its implementing agreements concur in the interpretation that we present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.641" offset="6876101">And finally, the 1976 tax reform bill now awaiting the President's signature restates and reconfirms that Petitioners are not exempt from United States taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.663" offset="6912150">In short, the correct result in this case could scarcely be clearer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.217" offset="6934406">And so, in discharging its sole responsibility in this area, to give effect to the intent of the parties, this Court should reject Petitioners' efforts to create for themselves a private tax haven.</text>

            <text syncTime="2451.999" offset="9961476">No one ever came... when they were in their various positions, no one ever came to the United States Government and said: You're taxing your people and we have a treaty that says you can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.973" offset="10005361">And in fact, quite to the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2490.557" offset="10115703">And consequently, we did some checking on those views and we found that when he was the President of Panama he wrote a letter to President Carter that's contained in the... that's printed in the Congressional Record, in which it's quite clear that Mr. Royo as the President of Panama understood that the United States was going to--</text>

            <text syncTime="2632.698" offset="10684232">In fact, though, rather than spend much more time on the Panamanian note, our position doesn't depend on the Panamanian note, because our position is even if you look simply at the language of the implementing agreement in context, the Petitioner's position is implausible, particularly when you realize that what we're talking about is a tax exemption and this Court has said on many occasions that provisions granting special tax exemptions are to be strictly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.615" offset="10791961">Now, their argument flows from the notion that fragments of the agreement can be isolated and interpreted without regard to their surroundings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.721" offset="10828323">Now, let's recognize that this was not first and foremost a tax treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.775" offset="10848594">The overall effect and the principal purpose of the package of treaties and agreements signed on September 7th, 1977, was to reduce the United States' presence in the area of Panama known as the Canal Zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.618" offset="10907944">To that effect, the treaty restored to Panama territorial sovereignty over the Canal Zone, ending the period when the United States had exercised the rights, power, and authority it would have if it were the sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.508" offset="10955487">The treaty gave to the United States the rights to manage, operate, and maintain the canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.644" offset="10976072">But it recognized in Article 1, paragraph 3, that the Republic of Panama shall participate increasingly in the management and protection and the defense of the canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.202" offset="11022256">To carry out that goal, the goal of increased Panamanian participation, Article 10 of the treaty requires that a preference be given to Panamanian applicants for employment, that within five years from the effective date the number of carry-over U.S. citizens employed by the Commission be reduced by 20 percent, that subsequently hired United States citizen employees be rotated out of Panama at least every five years, and that an early retirement program be set up for U.S. citizen employees to encourage early retirement by making liberal annuities available to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.429" offset="11183170">Now, with the restoration of sovereignty to Panama, one of the issues that had to be resolved was how the new sovereign would treat our employees, that is U.S. Government employees, keeping in mind that the treaty itself recognizes that the Panama Canal Commission is an agency of the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.740" offset="11252447">So all of the suggestions by Petitioner and in the Claims Court opinion that somehow this is a peculiar kind of organization--</text>

            <text syncTime="2809.078" offset="11389851">The letter from the general counsel of the Commission that's contained in the record indicates that treaty interpretation is a subject on which the Commission felt that it did not have the expertise to opine and left that to the State Department and the executive branch; and on the consequences for U.S. tax law, that that was a subject on which it would defer to other agencies, and specifically refer to the opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice, that is consistent with the proposition that there is no exemption from U.S. taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.753" offset="11540525">In agreeing to shift the U.S. Government's exercise of powers from a territorial-based position to one that was functionally related to the particular functions that the United States was permitted under the treaty, one of the issues was how U.S. citizens were going to be treated insofar as taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.506" offset="11651494">And as we explain in our brief, the implementation agreement in which the tax provision is contained was intended to define the rights of United States citizens with respect to Panama.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.730" offset="11708441">Relations between the United States Government and its own citizens and employees underwent no change.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.568" offset="11731742">That is, before the treaty these were U.S. citizens employed by the U.S. Government agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.787" offset="11748669">After the treaty they continued to be U.S. citizens employed by a U.S. Government agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.923" offset="11769149">Now, if we turn to the treaty in implementation of Article 3, the basic themes of the underlying treaty itself are restated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.929" offset="11801228">So Articles 9 and 11 establish a preference for Panamanian sources to furnish supplies and services for the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.618" offset="11835918">And in Article 15 we have the question of taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.022" offset="11857548">At the time... up to the time that the treaty was in effect, the income tax situation was this: United States citizen employed by the then.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.662" offset="11904150">Panama Canal Company, like all other U.S. citizens employed by a U.S. Government agency, paid U.S. income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.566" offset="11931735">But because they lived and worked in an area over which the United States exercised rights it would have as sovereignty, they paid no income taxes to Panama.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.089" offset="11969874">The treaty, as we've indicated, affected only the relationship between the employees and Panama.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.112" offset="11997982">So Article 15 makes no reference to United States taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.814" offset="12012715">It creates no express or implied exemption from U.S. taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.866" offset="12032986">Rather, that article preserves the status quo of no income tax by Panama in a way that's consistent with the position the United States maintains for its citizen employees in all foreign nations around the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.893" offset="12093068">Now, while there was, as the contemporaneous negotiating history shows, considerable debate on Panama's expressed desire to tax those U.S. citizens, there is no doubt that that issue was resolved by Panama's agreement that there would be an exemption from Panamanian taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.189" offset="12166210">But there is no suggestion in the negotiating history that the subject of a total exemption from United States taxes was ever considered or discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.711" offset="12208320">We needn't go very far from the words of the first sentence of Article 15, paragraph 2, to see that the context supports the Government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.268" offset="12246563">In fact, as mentioned earlier, we don't need to leave those words at all because the words in the first sentence are identical to the words in Article 16 of the military agreement, and the Claims Court and the Panamanian minister at page 141 of the Court of Appeals appendix recognized that military people would pay taxes to the United States, U.S. citizen military people.</text>

            <text syncTime="3053.705" offset="12368294">I've been advised by the Panama Canal Commission that from October 1, 1979, the date that the treaty went into effect, until September 22nd, 1986, the amount of taxes withheld from salaries of Commission employees was slightly in excess of $100 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.999" offset="12445512">Our point on the meaning of the first sentence of paragraph 2 is that... is made even clearer if you just go to the next sentence in paragraph 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.163" offset="12518132">If the Petitioners are correct as to the meaning of the first sentence, then presumably the second sentence would mean that U.S. citizens employed by the Commission are exempt from U.S. taxes on everything that they might earn in the United States, whether it be interest on bank accounts, dividends on stocks, or income from rental property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.743" offset="12600470">Now, in their reply brief they've proposed a new interpretation of this second sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.564" offset="12631712">It's basically nonsense, because on the face of it it doesn't make any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.718" offset="12656372">What they have done is suggested that the first sentence is subject to no limitations, it means any taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.407" offset="12691167">But when they get to the second sentence they say, well, the second sentence must mean only taxes, only on income from the Commission outside of Panama.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.429" offset="12727216">Never mind that the agreement itself defines a U.S. citizen employee as someone working for the Commission in Panama.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.118" offset="12753965">But since the second sentence refers only to Commission income outside of Panama, therefore the first sentence must refer to Commission income inside of Panama.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.759" offset="12804539">Well, they've now put back into the first sentence the very qualifier which in paragraphs 1 and 3 they recognize means that only Panamanian taxes are affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.734" offset="12848424">And you also end up with the silly result that any other income they have in the United States can be taxed by Panama, any other income they have in Panama could be taxed by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.939" offset="12893250">It just doesn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.724" offset="12916343">And to suggest that the second sentence would mean that there would be an exemption for anything else they earned in the United States would create the kind of incentive for them to remain on the job indefinitely that is contrary to the position that Panama took in the negotiations and all the provisions designed to reduce the U.S. role in the operations of the canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.856" offset="13004950">So if we had only the language of the treaty, it's our position that the Government should prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.076" offset="13025743">And of course we have more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.510" offset="13031490">We have the position the United States consistently took in the negotiating history, namely that we were discussing only an exemption from Panamanian taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.301" offset="13070674">In fact, the backup position that the Panamanians proposed, namely, well, let us tax but you give them a credit, that presupposes that the United States is going to be taxing its citizens employed by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.359" offset="13126890">There's no need for a credit if there's an exemption from United States taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.762" offset="13148519">And I think that maybe nothing makes the point more clearly that only the subject of Panamanian taxation was under discussion than the statement made by Ambassador Bunker at page 146 of the appendix in the Court of Appeals, at which he said that:</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.955" offset="13205361">"U.S. Government employees do not pay income tax anywhere in the world. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.509" offset="13235559">Now, what could more clearly show that they were talking about countries other than the United States?</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.032" offset="13269623">The consistency of the Government's position is maintained following the signing of the treaty and its implementing agreements, and we've adhered vigorously to that interpretation without wavering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.720" offset="13312359">That is, that Article 15 creates no exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.689" offset="13324271">The section by section analysis, which is an authoritative statement by the State and Defense Departments, takes that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.093" offset="13349871">The legal advisor to the State Department in questions before the Senate took that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.265" offset="13378501">And much has been made of Senator Stone's... in the briefs, of Senator Stone's comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.186" offset="13406191">But if we read everything that Senator Stone had to say, he simply... he never expressed any disagreement with the State Department's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.942" offset="13437224">He simply inquired whether... he just said he was trying, he was only trying to avoid lawsuits such as this one, which he agreed</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.880" offset="13472960">"would not really be much of a lawsuit. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.249" offset="13486439">Now, the Senate report adopted that interpretation, and the consistent administrative practice, as I've indicated, has been taxes are withheld and any claims for exemption based on this treaty are denied by the IRS.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.140" offset="13538057">That's been the consistent position of the Department of Justice, the Department of State, Department of Defense, Department of the Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.996" offset="13565433">And of course, the latest legislative action on the subject is the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which reconfirms and restates with all the precision and clarity that anyone could ask for that the treaty has never made Petitioners exempt from U.S. taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.840" offset="13624888">So on the basis of all this clear history, there really isn't any serious doubt that as a matter of domestic law there is no exemption from U.S. taxation, none was intended, and none was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.980" offset="13677446">So our position is that the judgment of the Federal Circuit should be affirmed, even if the Panamanian Government had remained silent, as we know it didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.621" offset="13723944">As of this date, both governments are in concurrence as to what the treaty means, and in those circumstances the judgment should be affirmed and Petitioners should have to pay U.S. income taxes just like the rest of us do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.667" offset="13792176">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3411.200" offset="13798341">Do you have anything more, Mr. Phillips?</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="3413.634" offset="13808059">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, just a couple points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.086" offset="13817881">First, Mr. Ganzfried consistently tells the Court that the negotiating history preceding this agreement contains no discussion of United States domestic taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.525" offset="13855601">But at the very end of his comments he discusses the tax credit issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.394" offset="13871066">When the United States responded to a proposal for a domestic tax credit, the United States negotiators didn't say: We don't negotiate about domestic income taxes with foreign governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.000" offset="13909518">They said: That's a matter of money, that's a financial issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.320" offset="13926759">That's fully consistent with our view that the sovereignty concerns that were paramount among the State diplomats were protected in order to... by conceding away the tax concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.878" offset="13977019">As Mr. Ganzfried said, this was not a tax proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.830" offset="13988826">These were not tax lawyers who negotiated this treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.365" offset="14002932">Second, with respect to Justice White's question concerning who has... to whom is deference owed with respect to the operation of the treaty, there is evidence from the Panama Canal Commission supervisory board that it did understand this treaty to provide a bilateral tax exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.259" offset="14078478">That board denied a cost of living increase to all of these employees in part, by the foreign minister who presented this note to the United States, for reasons that he said clearly; that there's an exemption already for U.S. taxes; they are not entitled to any additional allowances, they don't need that; they've gotten all of the protection they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.007" offset="14161548">And that cost of living adjustment was denied, largely on the basis of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.060" offset="14177743">So the only agency that really does implement this particular agreement has reached that conclusion.</text>
