            <text syncTime="66.625" offset="417531">The State of Nevada is here today on a writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.679" offset="437698">That Federal Circuit Court of Appeals held a Nevada statute, which provided for the mandatory imposition of a death penalty under certain circumstances, unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.202" offset="475836">That holding of the Ninth Circuit was contrary to a holding of the highest court in Nevada, the Nevada Supreme Court, which addressed the same question, and held it to be constitutional under both the U.S. Constitution, and the Nevada constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.760" offset="526096">Which brings us here this morning to the issue, to the question that is presented for this Court's determination this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.632" offset="553577">Which is: Did the imposition of a mandatory death penalty on an inmate, convicted of premeditated murder while serving a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, imposed for an earlier, unrelated first degree... first degree murder conviction, constitute a cruel and unusual punishment as prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.981" offset="650961">The State of Nevada submits that, no, it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.282" offset="668202">The imposition of a mandatory death sentence in this case did not violate the Eighth Amendment, or did not violate any other provisions of the United States Constitution; and that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision was incorrect for the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.494" offset="732986">First, the Nevada statute is consistent... was consistent... with the basic tenets, the basic holdings of the Eighth Amendment, that in death penalty cases there be an individualized consideration of the character, in this case of the inmate, his record, and the circumstances of the latest murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.706" offset="809890">Secondly, Nevada submits that its statute, as drawn at that time, narrowly defined the class of persons who were eligible for imposition of a mandatory death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.097" offset="855448">Only the most incorrigible of people were subject to this ultimate sanction: those who are serving a life term, a life sentence, without the possibility of parole who then commit another first degree murder and are convicted of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.291" offset="920231">There's been a societal decision to remove these people forever from free society.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.279" offset="948130">Their criminal behavior is so unacceptable that there has been a determination that rehabilitation in these instances is simply not possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="522.722" offset="2241923">And that's the next point that I was going to come to, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.824" offset="2254357">There has been a legislative determination, or there was a legislative determination, by the elected representatives of the people of the State that a mandatory death penalty was in fact necessary to enhance the valid goals of criminal justice that this Court has recognized, the goals of retribution, of deterrence, and of incapacitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.238" offset="2331993">And if that legislative judgment, provided of course that it comports with the basic requirements of the Eighth Amendment and the other constitutional provisions that apply to death penalty cases, is entitled to great deference by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.962" offset="2386850">Additionally, there is no question in this case as to the personal culpability, the personal responsibility, the moral guilt of the respondent; that's been conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.953" offset="2430840">This Court has also been greatly concerned with the reliability of the process of the imposition of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.440" offset="2456754">We would submit that the quality of the record in this case makes clear that the process has been reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.244" offset="2480055">There's been no wanton, arbitrary, capricious or irrational imposition in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.184" offset="2507745">Addressing the respondent's primary argument that has been made, and his reliance upon Eddings v. Oklahoma, I think revolves around this Court's holding in Eddings v. Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.741" offset="2554034">The Court held in that case that when a statute that provided for aggravating and mitigating circumstances was on the books, and had to be addressed before there could be an imposition of the death penalty, that the sentencer was required to give weight and to consider any and all mitigating circumstances, and that they could not preclude consideration of mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.654" offset="2645671">That was the major holding in the Eddings case, and citing back to Lockett v. Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.058" offset="2667301">That case was not a mandatory death penalty case.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.760" offset="2678063">That case did not involve the inmate who was serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.180" offset="2699797">I submit to this Court that Eddings v. Oklahoma did not say that in each and every capital case that any and all mitigating circumstances had to be presented to the sentencer prior to the imposition of a sentence at a separate sentencing hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.975" offset="2770955">The Court simply didn't hold that.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.258" offset="2780045">I believe that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has put words in this Court's mouth that it has yet to utter on this particular subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.482" offset="2828946">Therefore, because none of the constitutional infirmities that have been found by this Court in the past in Furman, in Woodson, in Lockett, in Coker, in Inman, in Eddings, simply do not exist in the case, in this particular case, because they simply are not there; that Nevada's mandatory death penalty statute at that time, imposing a mandatory death penalty on inmates who commit a murder while serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole is constitutional; and that such a holding would be consistent with this Court's prior holding on mandatory death cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.739" offset="2977949">We also submit that Shuman's death sentence is valid as applied under the facts of this case, and that the Ninth Circuit decision needs to be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.313" offset="3024238">Now the legal issue in this case has arisen from the following facts, which I think are necessary and appropriate to briefly go over.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.068" offset="3059346">In 1973 the respondent, Raymond Wallace Shuman, was incarcerated in the Nevada State Prison, where he was serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole, having been convicted of a prior first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.678" offset="3117756">While incarcerated in prison in 1973, he became embroiled in an argument with the inmate occupying an adjacent cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.368" offset="3152551">That argument was over the opening and closing of a window.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.753" offset="3166031">Respondent elected to resolve that argument by pouring flammable liquid all over the inmate and lighting him on fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.508" offset="3197064">As a result of this burning, the inmate died three days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.479" offset="3216917">Respondent was charged with murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.962" offset="3222873">He was tried in 1975 by a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.514" offset="3237084">He testified on his own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.216" offset="3243875">He testified as to his character.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.199" offset="3251817">He testified as to the circumstances of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.453" offset="3264878">Other witnesses testified on his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.003" offset="3275013">Nonetheless, the jury found his guilty of capital murder, and under Nevada law, in effect at that time, a mandatory death sentence was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.643" offset="3309600">Also under Nevada law at that time, the automatic appellate process began.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.380" offset="3332587">In 1978, the Nevada Supreme Court upheld both the conviction of the respondent and the imposition of the mandatory death sentence, specifically recognizing this Court's intervening decisions in Woodson v. North Carolina and Roberts v. Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.924" offset="3398729">The court, the Nevada Supreme Court, held that this was that rare and unique circumstance that the Court had alluded to in Gregg, and had specifically footnoted in Woodson and in Roberts.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.315" offset="3448258">The Court found that there simply could not be any mitigating circumstances in a case such as this that would allow for this latest crime, this latest murder, to go unpunished.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.338" offset="3492352">As a result of that... and the court also found, for what it's worth, that the respondent was entitled and not precluded from introducing mitigating evidence or mitigating circumstances on his behalf.</text>

            <text syncTime="1120.006" offset="4631082">We believe that the Court has the unusual opportunity to look at the facts of this case as if it were in a laboratory.</text>

            <text syncTime="3047.877" offset="12342533">And certainly a jury should be able... or a sentencer should be able to take that into account as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.614" offset="12365521">I submit, however, that the district court, the U.S. district court, was not concerned with the actual facts, but whether there should be an opportunity for a hearing to hear these mitigating factors in the state court before a sentencer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.922" offset="12418706">I submit to the court, also, that there are numerous policy reasons, and therefore, supporting our position that the Constitution mandates a mitigation hearing in these cases, as to why you should be entitled to have a mitigation hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.304" offset="12512225">First of all, the only person to lose anything as a result of this sentence, if you will, is going to be Mr. Shuman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.810" offset="12546289">He will be executed, and that will be it for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.695" offset="12561858">If you have a mitigation hearing, the state doesn't lose anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.833" offset="12582338">They could still seek perhaps the same punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.635" offset="12593622">So they're not out of the ballpark, so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.372" offset="12616506">The state interests are also served by a discretionary death penalty statute, if you order having a mitigating hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.044" offset="12655167">Because they can still seek the same thing, as I indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.464" offset="12676901">They're not going to lose out on making their arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.852" offset="12694455">And it's also an interest of a state, I submit, that they hear whether a life is worth saving; I submit that they cannot close their ears and bury their head in the sand before they hear about a person's life and just send him off to be executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.564" offset="12769270">Another extremely important factor is that no legislature can ever forecast all the mitigating factors of a person's life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.287" offset="12816186">The state, in effect, has conceded this by changing the law in Nevada 10 years ago, in 1977, by allowing the hearing of mitigating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.916" offset="12890687">The argument that the state has raised, in saying that these types of individuals should never, ever have the possibility of being out in society again, and should be automatically executed, is belied by the... and contradicted by the own conduct of the state in providing for the present scheme that they now have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.298" offset="12988176">I submit to the Court, also, that not all people who do life are necessarily murderers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.404" offset="13020672">You could be an aider and abetter, perhaps, or it could come under the felony murder rule, or something of that nature.</text>
