            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="149903">Mr. Masouredis, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="linus_masouredis" startTime="64.941" stopTime="235.451">
            <label>Mr. Linus Masouredis</label>
            <text syncTime="64.941" offset="409665">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.227" offset="422726">This case is an appeal from a judgment of the Ninth Circuit which held that California's environmental regulation under the California Coastal Act of Granite Rock's limestone mining on federal forest lands was preempted by the Forest Service's surface use regulations and by the 1872 Mining Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.224" offset="510706">Now, before getting to the facts I'd like to try and summarize the three points that we hope to make in this argument:</text>
            <text syncTime="96.026" offset="534007">First, the state is not seeking to prohibit all mining by Granite Rock, nor does the state claim the authority to be able to determine what are permissible and prohibited uses of federal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.769" offset="588969">The state accepts mining as a given federally defined and federally authorized use of this property, and it seeks to apply the environmental controls in the Coastal Act to this mining to minimize the adverse environmental effects of that given federally authorized use.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.598" offset="664202">And while these environmental controls happen to be included in the Coastal Act, they're no different than environmental and reclamation controls that many other western states have been routinely applying to private mining on federal lands over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.923" offset="721567">Secondly, the test for preemption in this case is not whether the state's environmental regulation duplicates that of the Forest Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.513" offset="755944">There are many areas where federal regulation is not intended to be exclusive and where duplicative state regulation not only doesn't conflict with federal regulation, but actually furthers federal regulatory objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.622" offset="816339">We believe that this is one of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.926" offset="829505">The Ninth Circuit we believe applied an erroneous preemption rule because it essentially concluded that the state's regulation inherently undermined the Forest Service's authority simply because the state's regulation duplicated the Forest Service regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.286" offset="898990">Finally, the third point, to us it appears as if the relevant question under the Coastal Zone Management Act is not whether the lands Granite Rock is mining fall within the definition of excluded federal lands within the meaning of 16 U.S.C. Section 14531.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.551" offset="984045">Rather, to us the relevant question is in excluding federal lands from the coastal zone for purposes of the coastal zone management program did Congress intend to preempt the police power authority that states otherwise have over private activities on excluded federal lands, and which states can enforce apart from the CZMA program under their police power.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="235.451" offset="1091670">Is this being done apart from the CZMA program?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="linus_masouredis" startTime="238.570" stopTime="266.471">
            <label>Mr. Linus Masouredis</label>
            <text syncTime="238.570" offset="1104104">Yes, it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.403" offset="1107447">The Coastal Act is an independent police power statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.688" offset="1120613">I think the Ninth Circuit found that.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.640" offset="1128450">The Act was enacted in 1976 and the state was enforcing it long before the coastal zone management program was approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.663" offset="1164499">And even if the state for some reason pulls out of the coastal zone management program or if the federal government terminates our authorization, the state will continue to enforce the Coastal Act.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="266.471" offset="1215699">Well, it may not be the same program, but it is certainly the same sort of coastal zone management scheme, as opposed to a separate environmental statute dealing with one or another type of environmental damage.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="linus_masouredis" startTime="283.599" stopTime="344.154">
            <label>Mr. Linus Masouredis</label>
            <text syncTime="283.599" offset="1284244">Well, I think again that Public Resources Code 30,008 indicates that the state will apply the environmental controls of the Coastal Act to excluded federal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.990" offset="1333772">And a coastal zone program is something that the state devises on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.644" offset="1360417">It can include whatever statutes that it wants in the coastal zone management program.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.965" offset="1381733">If those meet the federal criteria, the federal government will approve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.000" offset="1393854">But the statutes themselves aren't enforced solely through the coastal zone management program.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.403" offset="1423425">They had an independent existence to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.188" offset="1434605">That's how they got included in the management program.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.926" offset="1449547">They had to be enacted as police power statutes initially, and those statutes can be enforced wholly independent of the coastal zone management program.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.282" offset="1486954">It's a voluntary program.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.515" offset="1491865">States aren't required to join up, and the statutes that they include in the program don't have to be enforced solely through the management program.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="344.154" stopTime="362.949">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="344.154" offset="1526452">But if the states can do the same thing by a coastal zone, a state coastal zone management program that is not part of the federal program, what possible purpose does the exclusion of the federal lands from the federal coastal zone management program achieve?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="linus_masouredis" startTime="362.949" stopTime="454.791">
            <label>Mr. Linus Masouredis</label>
            <text syncTime="362.949" offset="1601684">As we see it, the CZMA, adds to the state's police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.185" offset="1622582">It doesn't detract and limit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.569" offset="1632091">And the purpose of 14531 was a Congressional judgment not to delegate to states the authority to define permissible and prohibited uses of federal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.427" offset="1679529">The CZMA itself tells a state that it must include in its management program a definition of permissible land and water uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.135" offset="1722370">Now, that's the equivalent of zoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.670" offset="1728535">That's the ability to go out and say: This is a use that will occur here, this use won't occur there.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.139" offset="1750373">That's what we call land use determination power.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.942" offset="1765629">States don't have that under their police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.560" offset="1780048">They can't ordinarily do that to federal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.529" offset="1791960">And I think Congress by enacting the excluded lands provision said, we're going to withhold that delegation of authority and states can't define permissible land and water uses on federal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.522" offset="1851937">But that doesn't mean that everything that happens to be included in the management program can't be applied to federal lands, because for example the CZMA says that a management program must include the air and water quality requirements of the federal Clean Air and Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.068" offset="1926125">And we don't understand Granite Rock or the Solicitor General to be arguing that those things which are in the management program cannot be applied to excluded federal lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="460.945" offset="1993625">Just what sort of, if it's possible to say from the record, what sort of questions is California going to ask in this permit proceeding?</text>

            <text syncTime="1531.464" offset="6275722">It would mean that those inland states, like Colorado and Wyoming and Montana, which have been regularly applying environmental controls to private mining activities on federal lands can continue to do so because they're unaffected by the CZMA, whereas those coastal states which chose to participate in the CZMA program are stripped of that police power authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.031" offset="6378017">It would also mean that, even within the state of California, there is a bizarre distinction between the state's ability to apply regulatory controls in the inland portion of the state, federal lands in the inland portion, but that within the coastal one the state's police power is collapsed within the confines of the CZMA program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.111" offset="6458265">And we don't see that there is any evidence of that in the legislative history or the language of the CZMA statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3007.165" offset="12178559">California really contends that the federal lands exclusion in this case is inapplicable for two reasons: First, the original argument that they made was that the statutory exclusion does not apply to federal lands that are subject to a mining claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.324" offset="12231118">This contention is the contention that was set forth in the letter that was originally sent to Granite Rock, that is contained in the joint appendix at page 22 to 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.263" offset="12266853">Now, this contention I think all agree now is plainly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.382" offset="12279392">Federal lands that are subject to mining claims remain in federal ownership and hence are excluded lands within the meaning of the CZMA regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.738" offset="12316799">The Coastal Commission also argues that the federal lands exclusion does not limit the Commission's authority in this case because the Coastal Act is an exercise of the state's inherent police power that exists independently of the CZMA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.878" offset="12369358">That is the ground that's offered primarily by the state at this juncture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.080" offset="12382210">But the CZMA clearly contemplates that once a state's coastal management program is approved it will provide a singular and complete coastal management program for the state's coastal zone.</text>

            <text syncTime="3194.785" offset="12929005">The CZMA expressly states that federal approval of the state coastal management program is conditioned on state compliance with the federal rules and regulations that govern the CZMA programs, and those regulations include the CZMA's federal lands exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.644" offset="12984385">The fact that the states may retain authority to regulate federal lands under other state statutory regimes, such as the clean water acts statute I alluded to either... earlier before, is beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.650" offset="13024404">The California Coastal Act is a federally approved CZMA program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.888" offset="13037361">It must comply with the pertinent CZMA regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3252.007" offset="13157838">In the federal government's view, that is a permit within the meaning of Section 307 and therefore it is subject to consistency review requirements of Section 307.3.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.081" offset="13210187">I think it's also worth pointing out here that California at the time that it sought its CZMA approval expressly stated that federal lands would be excluded from the California state zone, state coastal zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.103" offset="13254282">This appears at the joint appendix, page 106.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.222" offset="13266716">And although California later amended its statute, that amendment, we were instructed, amounted only to a technical change, did not amount to any substantial amendment in their coastal zone program.</text>

            <label>Mr. Linus Masouredis</label>
            <text syncTime="3347.816" offset="13541106">Yes, very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.735" offset="13544763">First of all, I think we have a disagreement as to what the terms are of the Coastal Act itself and the permitting process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.889" offset="13577364">The Coastal Act has two types of permitting processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.909" offset="13593456">One occurs when a local coastal program has been reviewed and certified, the implementing ordinances have been approved, and then permit authority devolves upon the local government to issue permits in accordance with its local coastal program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.635" offset="13656359">That's not at issue in this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.187" offset="13666599">We're dealing with the second type of permitting, which is by the Coastal Commission itself, not a local government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.258" offset="13694915">The Coastal Commission is the party involved here, not the County of Monterey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.995" offset="13709857">And what's being enforced is the Coastal Act itself, not the Monterey land use plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.466" offset="13731696">The Coastal Act has a number of environmental performance standards in chapter 3 of the Act, and the Coastal Commission issues permits based upon compliance with the environmental criteria in the Coastal Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.456" offset="13787702">So I think there's a misconception here as to what the permitting process is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.010" offset="13805883">We're not dealing with a local government issuing permits in accordance with the local land use plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.747" offset="13828871">Secondly, the Coastal Act is not enforced, as I tried to indicate earlier, solely through the coastal zone management program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.937" offset="13865547">It's an independent statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.889" offset="13873384">It was enacted in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.289" offset="13882997">Federal approval came in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.274" offset="13894909">The state was enforcing that act wholly apart from the CZMA program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.578" offset="13916120">And if you took, for example, the assumption that the state pulls out of the Coastal Zone Management Act system... that's a voluntary system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.350" offset="13955199">The state can withdraw from it at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.435" offset="13963559">If we pulled out of that system, this statute wouldn't collapse, the Coastal Commission wouldn't go out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.622" offset="13988323">It would be enforcing this as a state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.258" offset="13998876">So I think the Solicitor General's attempt to tie this statute into the CZMA and say that's the only existence to this statute is basically incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.632" offset="14040359">Now, in addition the argument is made that the state is bound by the federal rules under the CZMA and that we therefore have to enforce this statute in accordance with the CZMA rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.540" offset="14096052">But one of the federal CZMA regulations is 923.33(c)(2) at 15 Code of Federal Regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.914" offset="14133459">And that very provision, which was adopted by the federal government, tells states that in excluding federal lands for purposes of the coastal zone management program they retain their police power authority over those federal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.174" offset="14194585">And so we don't believe that California has violated the terms of the CZMA program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.661" offset="14216528">We've simply availed ourselves of the right to apply our police power to federal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.982" offset="14241815">That's something that the federal government has expressly noted, that we have that authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="3535.303" offset="14291030">There was a question raised about the Forest Service regulations and about the reference to compliance with state permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.592" offset="14324257">That is in the actual Forest Service decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.278" offset="14338990">It's not in the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.730" offset="14344737">But the regulations do point out that state approvals and certifications will be accepted as compliance with parallel requirements of the Forest Service regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.203" offset="14394683">And that's Section 228.8(h), and that section is based on the assumption... I see that my time is expired.</text>
