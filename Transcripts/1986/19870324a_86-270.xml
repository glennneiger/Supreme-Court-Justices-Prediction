            <label>Ms. Mary C. Dunlap</label>
            <text syncTime="12.724" offset="202941">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.260" offset="213076">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the United States Olympic Committee in both its statutory and its constitutional position in this case, aims and hits wide of the mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.019" offset="276083">Congress, in the enactment of the Amateur Sports Act of 1978 sought to bestow upon the United States Olympic Committee a trademark and, among other things, the word "Olympic".</text>
            <text syncTime="43.427" offset="325716">The legislative history on this matter is plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.731" offset="342957">In part it states, in a letter from the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, and this is at Page 7495 of the Congressional Code and Administrative News for the pertinent Bill,:</text>
            <text syncTime="61.205" offset="396874">"It is our understanding that this sub-section.... "</text>
            <text syncTime="64.239" offset="408994">The sub-section at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.191" offset="420802">"# is intended to make actionable those marks which falsely represent an association with the Olympics. "</text>
            <text syncTime="76.047" offset="456224">So, we know at the very least, from the legislative history, that the purpose and the intent of the user of the word "Olympic" does matter under the Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.820" offset="495303">Congress cared whether a user of the word U.S. Olympic Committee or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.426" offset="533755">It is our position in this case that the very first issue that should have been tried below was whether the "Gay Olympic Games" sponsors' use of the word "Olympic" had any tendency whatsoever to confuse, to cause mistake or to falsely suggest some relationship with the United States Olympic Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.887" offset="599584">A number of facts in the record would have borne upon that question, had the lower Court afforded us a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.855" offset="619437">For example, there would have been the fact that San Francisco Arts and Athletics offered to place a disclaimer of an appropriate size and appropriate effectiveness on all of its paraphernalia, claiming</text>
            <text syncTime="128.646" offset="666562">"Not associated with the United States Olympic Committee. "</text>
            <text syncTime="131.782" offset="679101">Perhaps more important and more to the point in this case, is the fact that the founders of the Dr. Waddell's letter, Dr. Waddell being the primary volunteer and founder of the games, who was also sued as a party Defendant below, to Mr. Miller, who was then the Executive Director of the U.S. Olympic Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.070" offset="804279">He wrote him a letter explaining why this particular organization claimed a right and wished to have consent to use the word "Olympic", and he said, I think, in the most important part of that letter:</text>
            <text syncTime="174.961" offset="851822">"Colonel Miller, these games are very specialized indeed. "</text>
            <text syncTime="179.448" offset="869794">"Our outreach and emphasis differs widely from the traditional Olympic Games, in that we, openly gay people around the world are struggling to produce an image that more closely resembles the facts, rather than some libidinous stereotype generated over decades of misunderstanding and intolerance. "</text>
            <text syncTime="199.593" offset="950356">In short, the essence of the U.S. Olympics, the U. S. Olympic Team and the International Olympic Games.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.686" offset="1002705">There was no confusion, we submit, nor was any proved below in the case of the gay users of the word "Olympic" and Congress cared, again, whether such confusion or false association was shown and it cared enough to put in the statute the language</text>
            <text syncTime="229.547" offset="1070206">"tending to cause confusion, mistake or the like. "</text>

            <text syncTime="382.546" offset="1682203">It does make sense because it was Congress's purpose, once again, as set forth in the legislative history, to make actionable those marks which falsely represent an association with the Olympics.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.003" offset="1723998">Now, we can use some other language in the Statute and suggest that perhaps Congress wasn't perfectly grammatical in the exercise of its legislative verbiage here, when it said combination or simulation thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.811" offset="1775198">Certainly Congress didn't mean to reach only combinations of "Olympic" and "Olympiad" or simulations of "Olympic".</text>
            <text syncTime="412.282" offset="1801112">It meant to reach, for example, a trademark infringer using the following language:</text>
            <text syncTime="417.786" offset="1823159">"We are the Official U.S. Olympic Beer. "</text>
            <text syncTime="421.340" offset="1837370">That would imply, of course, that the U.S. Olympic Committee had an involvement, a participation in this particular product and that the product gave support to the U.S. Olympic Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.244" offset="1869030">That's a combination or simulation but not "thereof", not in the word "Olympic" but of the word "Olympic" and the word "beer".</text>

            <text syncTime="436.349" offset="1897347">Well, a very much easier way to get to that result is simply to say they used the word "Olympic", which is automatically made unlawful, whether it tends to cause confusion or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="461.065" offset="1996299">This has been heavily briefed but I think this particular segment is helpful:</text>
            <text syncTime="464.333" offset="2009360">"The present bill does not make the use of the various designations in Section 110(a) unlawful. "</text>
            <text syncTime="470.403" offset="2033602">And the Court will note that there was bill that got through the House, that would have given the U.S. Olympic Committee sui generis protection for the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.092" offset="2064322">Not a trademark, but as Judge Kozinski said below, "a crown monopoly" on the use of "Olympic".</text>
            <text syncTime="483.060" offset="2084279">No one could use it except the U.S. Olympic Committee and anyone, according to that legislative history, who used the word</text>

            <text syncTime="491.166" offset="2116671">and the Lanham Act was nowhere referred to in that bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.185" offset="2128792">That bill was rejected in favor of the language now before this Court and I think that is powerful evidence that Congress didn't mean, didn't intend and didn't consider putting aside every use of the word U.S. Olympic Committee's fiat over this unusual form of property.</text>

            <text syncTime="531.393" offset="2277585">That's how we refer to trademark owners, exclusive use is what they have but it does not mean exclusive use as against a non-infringing user, and it does not mean exclusive use in this case, reaching the Constitutional matter, of a word separate from its trademark value that had a powerful, political and associative value, not only to gay people but, apparently, to police, Armenians and a variety of others permitted their own Olympics with, if not the imprimatur, at least, the tacit consent of the U.S. Olympic Committee.</text>

            <text syncTime="998.631" offset="4146490">What it has also done, starting with the Stop the Olympic Prison case is, it has made an argument, based on the statute, that it is essentially entitled to control any use of the word U.S. Olympic Committee's purposes and we think Congress didn't go nearly so far in this Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.210" offset="4236874">Let me turn to the problem of what it would mean if Congress did go so far, because I think there are questions, there are extremely profound and important Constitutional questions here that have to be raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.054" offset="4288178">I think the bridge... there probably are several... but the conceptual bridge that occurs to me between trademark law and the First Amendment in particular and the Constitution in general, the bridge in this case is the bridge of genericness, classificatory language and as I understand this Court's opinion in Dollar Park and Fly, a generic word is not registrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.270" offset="4389115">I quote from the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.704" offset="4394862">"Generic terms are not registrable and a registered mark may be cancelled at any time on the grounds that it has become generic. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.477" offset="4429866">And as I understand it, again, the term generic refers to a genus, such as "Olympic" and, for example, in this case then the phrase "Gay Olympic Games" would refer to a species.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.785" offset="4483156">The genus that "Olympic" represents, the generic term that "Olympic" represents cannot be registered as a trademark.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.141" offset="4516593">So Congress did here as a constitutional matter what Congress cannot do in general with words under the Lanham Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1213.519" offset="5006127">Judge Kozinski, in dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc below, I think phrased well the problem, which is that when you loose these rights and intellectual property from their conceptual moorings, from their trademark law or other property right boundaries and you set them free, they roam across the First Amendment and take things away from people, such as the right of free speech in a fashion that Congress is surely not free to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="1316.567" offset="5418235">The main trouble I see with that approach is that it would sponsor trademark parody at the cost of serious speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.139" offset="5448537">Take, for example, the Girl Scout Poster.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.908" offset="5455643">You have a pregnant Girl Scout in the Personality Posters Case... it's cited to this Court in the amicus... and what the Court said there is, is no one in the world who is ever going to associate this with the Girl Scouts because those two things just don't go together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.133" offset="5508514">The idea being then, that a trademark parody, an absurdity, a piece of spurious or silly speech can use a generic word outside the trademark context and enjoy the full ambit of First Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.373" offset="5557520">A serious use of a generic word outside its expected context, such as "Gay Olympic Games", then deserves under this analysis, less protection than a frivolous use of a generic term and I think that's probably more than dangerous when it comes to affording the drawing of some boundary around the relationship between trademark law and the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1534.326" offset="6289262">May it please the Court, I will deal in a moment, if I may, with the questions of legislative history and purpose of the statute that were raised in the earlier argument but I would say at the beginning, that as we see it, the central issue in this case is a constitutional issue because we think the statute clearly covers and the issue is whether Congress had sufficient basis to pass this very important legislation, which is the foundation of amateur sports in the United States and which imposes a very limited and a very traditional kind of restriction on Petitioners use of a label.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.301" offset="6449236">Whether Congress, in short, could prevent them from using the U.S. Olympic Committee's label to label their week-long international athletic games and there are three points that I think centrally bear on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.793" offset="6511198">The first is that this was not some kind of whimsical or casual or improvident largesse on the part of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.316" offset="6545262">Congress was recognizing, as it had earlier in 1950... and I might say, Justice Scalia, that the 1950 Statute sheds light also on the proper interpretation of the 1978 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.076" offset="6596358">The 1950 statute clearly had no requirement of confusion in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.611" offset="6618405">Congress was recognizing that the U.S. Olympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee were the creators of the modern Olympic games.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.418" offset="6657693">Congress was providing a very limited labeling protection for that very important creation and when people think of the Olympic Games today, the connotation of that word "Olympic", the state of Greek scholarship in this country is not such today that they are thinking of something that happened in valley under Mount Olympus as a religious festival in honor of Olympian Zeus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.265" offset="6749017">They are thinking about the creation of the U.S. Olympic Committee and International Olympic Committee going back to a group of people who got together in 1896 and thought that they would create something that would be a good thing for the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.894" offset="6811607">Congress and the States protect creations of all kinds, all the time, under various legal headings and I would say the Lanham Act certainly does not exhaust the constitutional power of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.701" offset="6858836">In fact, trademarks do not even exhaust what the Lanham Act does, as this Court has recognized in the Ives Labs case, Section 43 of the Lanham Act may very well go beyond trademark protection, but we have categories of misappropriation, antidilution, trademark, sometimes copyright and sometimes something even called privacy, as we had in the Zacchini case, and all of those kinds of protection have been recognized by this Court and most of them have been upheld against various kinds of First Amendment challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.839" offset="6995404">As this Court said in Friedman against Rogers, which dealt specifically with trade names, this Court said that when there is an adequate State purpose, States can regulate the use of trade names and that this Court is very cautious and very reluctant in approaching First Amendment challenges to commercial economic regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.890" offset="7095610">The second main point is that what is at stake here is the life blood of the U.S. Olympic Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.461" offset="7125807">There was a very important interest that Congress recognized here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.614" offset="7142421">The legislation in 1978 was passed at the culmination of a two-year study by a Presidential Commission, and that Presidential Commission concluded that U.S. amateur sports were in a tremendously difficult and, in fact, decaying situation and that there were two things, two things that were the problem with U.S. amateur sports at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.730" offset="7238970">The first was disorganization, which was hurting the athletes themselves, and the second was lack of funding, and it was clear in that report of the Presidential Commission, which came in after two years in 1977, and it is clear throughout the legislative history of the Amateur Sports Act of 1978... you cannot escape it... that one thing that the Commissioners and the Congress were all intent upon was keeping amateur sports well-funded but in the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.967" offset="7371881">Moreover, in order to deal with the problems that that Presidential Commission had recognized and pointed out, Congress did not just hand out a gift here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.223" offset="7408870">What Congress created here was a two-way street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.425" offset="7421723">Congress said, We will continue as we had in 1950 to protect the word "Olympic" and the other words and symbols associated with the Olympic Games.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.518" offset="7470101">We will give civil right of action instead of the criminal offense that existed in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.374" offset="7505523">We will continue all that but USOC has to do something in return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.592" offset="7526421">And if you look at Section 104 of the Act, there are fourteen different duties and obligations, a long list of obligations that were imposed upon the U.S. Olympic Committee in return for what it received from the Congress in the way of protection for its mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.156" offset="7600609">The third point I would make, is that clearly what Petitioners were seeking here was a free ride on the good will of the U.S. Olympic Committee's good name.</text>

            <text syncTime="3150.522" offset="12754046">I have a little bit of Latin left for the Court and this is not, this time, the Latin of the trivium of grammar, logic and rhetoric, but the Latin that says that in litigation a Court should be concerned with facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.662" offset="12810679">My opponent has argued to this Court that the Olympics is unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.333" offset="12829383">We won't dispute that, Justice Marshall, and then he has gone on to contend that it is the only thing called the Olympics, and there I think he defies the open record in a rather blatant and important way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.374" offset="12873478">What this Court has before it is a record, granted, again, without a trial, that shows that the word "Olympic" has been used... continues to be used in a variety of contexts to describe, among other things, athletic events held by what some might consider to be minority groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.019" offset="12952054">Among those most vividly and obviously similar to the U.S. Olympic Committee in terms of athletic activity, we have in the record, the Police with their International Olympics and the exhibits show that they are using the five rings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.945" offset="13007747">In fact, I understand two of those are handcuffs but they are five rings, all the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.249" offset="13024988">With the U.S. Olympic Committee in 1982 representing to the Court,</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.201" offset="13036795">"Oh, there's no discrimination here. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.685" offset="13042751">, we wrote them a letter and in 1984 when the Police continued to use the word "Olympic", no one says anything and they proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.689" offset="13066784">With all respect, the question of discrimination here is not a tiny one, it is not small one, it is not a trivial one because we have an entity funded by the U.S. Government and here I want to say on the point of funding, there has been a little bit of an anomaly, I think, in the USOC's position, because they argue on the one hand,</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.983" offset="13135956">"Congress gave us our most valuable asset in these trademarks. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.268" offset="13153092">"We raised forty (40) million dollars with them. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.720" offset="13158839">Miller's affidavit shows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.106" offset="13172423">And then they turn around in the State action realm and they say,</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.391" offset="13181618">"We never got any Government funding. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.974" offset="13187887">, and that's the mistake that the De Frantz Court made as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.910" offset="13195620">They said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.543" offset="13198127">"This entity isn't funded by the Government. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.278" offset="13205128">Funding alone is not State action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.762" offset="13211084">We're well aware of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.814" offset="13215264">There are a number of other factors here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.614" offset="13222474">All the factors this Court has set forth as important to State action, not the least of which is the structural derivative of the U.S. Olympic Committee from Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.936" offset="13255701">The Board of the U.S. Olympic Committee was named by Congress in the first section of the Amateur Sports Act, 371.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.506" offset="13282033">That makes this case dramatically different than Rendell-Baker versus Kohn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.310" offset="13297288">The State action question cannot be lightly set aside here, and in this case, what should happen is that the case should be remanded for a trial on the factual questions that determine whether this is a State actor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.433" offset="13341696">The reason that's so important is that, otherwise, San Francisco Arts and Athletics, which has set forth some serious and important counter-claims about invasion of its First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights will never have a trial on those counter-claims because the Court will do what the lower Courts have done and depart from its own precedents about what the indicia of State action are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.013" offset="13420064">But I think an even more crucial departure from the factual record occurred in my opponent's argument--</text>
