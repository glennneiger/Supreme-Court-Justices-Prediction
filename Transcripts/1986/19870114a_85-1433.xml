            <label>Mr. Timothy A. Baughman</label>
            <text syncTime="14.843" offset="208007">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.795" offset="219815">The constitutional issue before the Court in this case is whether Respondent's right to confront the witnesses against her was violated at her joint trial with Benjamin Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.983" offset="260566">Primarily the question is whether or not Benjamin Williams, through the admission of his redacted confession, became a witness against Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.923" offset="292330">Put another way, the question is whether the ordinary presumption that jurors can understand and will follow instructions should be put aside in this case in favor of a presumption that the jurors here disregarded two strong limiting instructions that Williams' confession was not to be considered against Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.718" offset="367459">Now, the facts very briefly put are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.503" offset="378639">Some eight years ago, as the culmination of a robbery, Ollie Scott, her niece Cynthia Knighton, and Cynthia Knighton's four year old son Koran Knighton were taken to the basement of the Scott home to be executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.577" offset="426913">Koran Knighton and Ollid Scott were shot to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.262" offset="437676">Cynthia Knighton, though shot three times, lived and testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.148" offset="453245">The trial was a joint trial with Benjamin Williams and Clarissa Marsh.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.052" offset="472784">Kareem Martin remained at large at this time, he was the third participant.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.404" offset="490234">Williams had confessed and the confession was redacted to remove all reference to Clarissa Marsh.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.443" offset="518342">From the confession as admitted, one would not know that any other individual, any third person, was involved in any way in this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.116" offset="557108">At the time of the admission of the confession into evidence, the trial judge gave a limiting instruction including a statement, to the jurors that to consider the confession against Respondent would be most unfair and a violation of their oath as jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.625" offset="615099">He repeated this instruction at the time of his full charge to the jury before deliberations.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.962" offset="640490">The Michigan Court of Appeals found no confrontation violation in the admission of the confession, relying on United States versus Bell, a case also cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.135" offset="673196">The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, however, disagreed, finding that there was constitutional error in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.639" offset="699109">That court found that the confession as redacted was powerfully incriminating of Respondent when taken in conjunction with her testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.144" offset="733173">Particularly, the court found that the confession was powerfully incriminating in that Respondent's testimony placed her in the vehicle with Martin and Williams at a time in which the confession indicated Williams and Martin discussed the plan to rob the house and kill the occupants.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.872" offset="804121">The court therefore held that the jury could not be trusted to follow the limiting instructions and that, since Williams did not testify and Respondent was unable to cross-examine him as to what went on in the car, confrontation rights were violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.580" offset="850933">We believe that this holding extends Bruton beyond its limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.382" offset="866084">It's very difficult, when asking whether the jury followed instructions in a particular set of circumstances, to raise the level of the inquiry beyond that of yes, they did, or no, they didn't, because we really have no way of knowing for certain.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.141" offset="925121">We believe that it is necessary, therefore, to engage in a systems analysis which involves the indulgence of certain presumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.981" offset="956572">We venerate trial by jury in our system of justice, and I believe rightly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.051" offset="976843">Trial by jury is perhaps the cornerstone of our view of the trial as a truth-seeking adventure, interposing as it does between the Government on the one hand, including the judiciary, and the accused on the other community fact finders.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.645" offset="1035148">But the jurors as community fact finders must find the facts within the context of the law as given them by the trial judge, including instructions on such things as the nature of the accusation, the burden of proof, the standard of proof, and in many circumstances the limited consideration that the jurors are to give to certain evidence which has been admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.058" offset="1124801">Our theory of justice relies upon the jury to follow all of these instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.378" offset="1146117">Because we rightly forbid a post-trial inquiry into the character of the jury deliberations, it must be presumed, as this Court has said on many occasions, that jurors are conscious of the gravity of their task, attend closely to particular language of the judge's instructions in a criminal case, and strive to understand, make sense of, and apply those instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.410" offset="1242247">The entire concept of limited admissibility, which is codified in the Federal Rules of Evidence, as well as in the Michigan Rules of Evidence, presumes that jurors will follow instructions to put certain evidence to a particular permissible purpose, or in some cases to consider it only against one of several parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.039" offset="1316748">And we apply these presumptions in very difficult circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.043" offset="1332735">For example, it may well be that in a case a confession has been taken from the defendant and yet is suppressed because it was obtained in violation of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.632" offset="1371083">However, if that same confession is found to be voluntary, under the rule of Harris versus New York it may be admitted for its impeachment value of the defendant's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.170" offset="1409326">In that case then, the jury will hear the very confession of the defendant him or herself as to their guilt in the crime charged before the court, and yet be instructed to consider that confession, not as to the issue of guilt or innocence, but only as to the testimonial credibility of the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.282" offset="1473692">If the jury fails to follow that instruction, that confession, the defendant's own confession, will certainly be powerfully incriminating of the accused, in violation of his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.055" offset="1516846">Yet we presume that the jury will follow the instruction and has the capacity to follow those instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.541" offset="1538789">Other examples are given, I believe, in the Solicitor's brief as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.295" offset="1557806">This Court has in fact declined to disregard, to set aside, the presumption that jurors follow instructions only very rarely.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.801" offset="1591766">In Jackson v. Denno this Court held that the jury could not be entrusted with the responsibility of determining whether the defendant's confession is voluntary and then be expected to, in the event the jury found the confession was involuntary, put aside that confession on the question of the defendant's guilt or innocence, even under instructions to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.965" offset="1672432">A second circumstance where this Court has found that the presumption should be set aside is Bruton itself, where this Court held that where the non-testifying defendant's confession or a co-defendant's confession is powerfully incriminating of the accused, the jury cannot be trusted to follow the limiting instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.093" offset="1744948">We submit that Bruton should be limited to factual situations akin to its own facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.664" offset="1767308">In Bruton, the accused... the co-defendant's confession was powerfully incriminating of Bruton because it named him in his role in the crime there charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.536" offset="1806701">It was therefore powerfully incriminating, this Court held, and because of that the jury could not follow the limiting instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.924" offset="1832301">And the Court noted as an important element of this conclusion the fact that statements from co-defendants incriminating the accused are looked upon as unreliable, given the recognized motivation of the co-defendant to shift blame.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.783" offset="1887785">Confrontation rights are thus violated when the accused... when the co-defendant does not testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.103" offset="1917042">However, when the factual context is different this Court has found that Bruton does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.824" offset="1939926">The plurality of this Court in Parker v. Randolph found that the Bruton exception has no application where the defendant him or herself has also confessed and confessed in a manner which is consistent with or interlocks with the co-defendant's confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.119" offset="2009098">In that circumstance, this Court said that the danger that the jury will disregard the cautionary instruction is lessened significantly, for the jury has before it the defendant's own confession upon which to focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.045" offset="2064791">We submit that our system of trial by jury requires that the presumption that jurors are capable of following instructions not be cast aside except in the most compelling of circumstances, and that Bruton represents the outer limit of how far this Court should go in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.572" offset="2130933">The Sixth Circuit recognized in this case a doctrine of evidentiary linkage or contextual implication, and we believe that this expands the Bruton doctrine substantially.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.446" offset="2178371">In Bruton we have a confession which not only mentioned the co-defendant, but mentioned him directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.282" offset="2205748">In contrast to that situation, we have here a confession which doesn't mention the Respondent directly, indeed which does not even indicate that a third person was in any way involved in the criminal event.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.638" offset="2247126">Standing alone, the confession in Bruton was powerfully incriminating of Bruton.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.375" offset="2270113">Standing alone, the confession in this case is not incriminating of the Respondent one whit.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.696" offset="2295400">Moreover, in Bruton this Court, as I indicated, referred to the unreliability of co-defendant's statements due to the recognized motivation to shift blame, which was an important peg of this court's holding in Bruton.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.539" offset="2350779">For reasons largely given in part two of our brief, I submit that in this case we have a different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.176" offset="2373349">It is not entirely accurate to state as a blanket rule that co-defendants' confessions are unreliable because they shift blame.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.996" offset="2400621">Some are and some aren't.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.115" offset="2405114">Some shift blame and some don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.965" offset="2412428">Some lay the responsibility for certain blame, but it is not blame-shifting as we might refer to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.286" offset="2437715">It is an accurate reporting of the events.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.423" offset="2450254">Under this Court's confrontation cases... Lee v. Illinois is a recent one... this Court has recognized that it is possible for a co-defendant's confession to be reliable, and we submit that the confession in this case was in fact reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.148" offset="2497170">So that peg of Bruton, as well as the directly incriminatory peg of Bruton, does not exist in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.884" offset="2528099">I would hasten to add that it is not my argument that, while jurors are capable of following limiting instructions in some very, very difficult circumstances, they are incapable of putting inferences together.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.811" offset="2583896">I would concede that it is possible for jurors to take redacted confessions and take other testimony and figure out that there might be some inculpatory inference when the two were taken together.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.600" offset="2622975">But that's not the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.202" offset="2629454">The question is whether or not the jurors will regard an instruction not to draw that inference or not to give it any weight in their deliberations.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.475" offset="2662473">In every circumstance of limited admissibility, the question we ask--</text>

            <text syncTime="641.531" offset="2714717">In every circumstance of limited admissibility, we do not ask the question of whether the jury is capable of drawing the impermissible inference or putting the evidence to the impermissible use.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.987" offset="2756513">We give them an instruction so they will not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.172" offset="2765290">If we did not think they had the capacity, there would be no need for the instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.326" offset="2785875">This case presents a different situation, we submit, from one where the confession itself powerfully incriminates the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.147" offset="2813147">Now, I would like to turn for a moment to your question, Justice Stevens, about the prosecutor's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.551" offset="2838851">Let me first address that directly and then I have a further point to make regarding it.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.037" offset="2856719">The prosecutor in this case I believe did make a comment about Respondent's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.025" offset="2876677">She did choose to take the stand and testify that she was in the vehicle with Williams and Martin, in the back seat, she testified, with the radio on and, though there was conversation going on between Williams and Martin, she did not know what it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.083" offset="2932892">The Petitioner as a preface to his lengthy argument as to how the jury could discern Respondent's involvement in the crime commented on that testimony by saying: Respondent said these things, and of course she said them; it's in her interest to say that she did not hear the conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.878" offset="2996108">He then said: But how else do we know she's involved in the plan, in the crime; and then proceeded, with some vigor and quite a bit of detail, to explain how apart from that the jury could know that the Respondent was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.852" offset="3048040">She did not act surprised when Martin pulled a gun in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.887" offset="3060161">She took a position of a lookout by the door at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="730.506" offset="3070610">--Mr. Baughman, on that point, it really is pretty obvious she was involved in some of the advanced planning.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.160" offset="3089209">I don't think there's much doubt about that inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.278" offset="3101748">But is there evidence that she would have known about the particular statement that one of the two men made to the other about, we have to take the lady out, or I forget the exact language, which would indicate a plan in advance to kill her?</text>
            <text syncTime="750.836" offset="3151903">Was there any evidence, other than perhaps her overhearing it from the back seat, that she would have known about that?</text>

            <text syncTime="768.881" offset="3224105">The charge here was felony murder, which does not require either the intent to kill or premeditation.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.951" offset="3244376">It requires what would amount to a second degree murder, which requires malice, the intent to kill, do great bodily harm, or wanton, willful disregard.</text>

            <text syncTime="888.874" offset="3704131">If there had never been a confession in this case by anyone, Cynthia Knighton's testimony would have been ample to convict her of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.734" offset="3767557">Finally, I would like to take just a moment to point out that it is my view that, even if the presumption that jurors can and will follow instructions is viewed as overcome in this case, that is not in and of itself a finding that the Constitution was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.846" offset="3835997">It is a finding that Benjamin Williams became a witness against Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.298" offset="3853761">Under this Court's confrontation cases, Lee v. Illinois being the one that I mentioned earlier, the further question remains in order to find constitutional error of whether or not the uncross-examined confession of Williams, even if admitted against Respondent, violated confrontation principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.759" offset="3919589">We would submit that even if the jury considered the confession as redacted substantively, disregarded the instruction, that constitutional confrontation principles would not be violated because the statement is reliable under this Court's cases, again Lee v. Illinois being the principal one.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.186" offset="3981343">The confession was devastating to Mr. Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.221" offset="3989493">He admitted that he was part of a preconceived plan to rob the dwelling and to kill the victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.041" offset="4008719">He was given a gun by Martin and had one himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.926" offset="4028259">He does say that it was not himself, but Martin, that carried out shootings.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.897" offset="4044141">But that testimony is corroborated by Cynthia Knighton.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.380" offset="4054172">That is not blame-shifting; it is an accurate reporting of what went on.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.532" offset="4066711">In large regard, the confession is corroborated by Cynthia Knighton's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.519" offset="4090639">The only point in which the confession is unreliable, we believe, is where Williams states that he was not present in the basement when the shootings occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.359" offset="4122090">That is inconsistent with Cynthia Knighton's testimony and we believe to be that is untrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.929" offset="4140272">But that attempt to curry favor on the part of Williams in his confession in no way reduced his culpability for the events, nor did it diminish the reliability of the rest of his statement, again corroborated in large part by Cynthia Knighton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.355" offset="4202025">So we believe this case is distinguishable from Lee v. Illinois and that, even if Benjamin Williams is viewed as a witness against Respondent, for him to be a witness against Respondent through his redacted confession is not a violation of the Constitution in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1096.225" offset="4533467">Justice Stevens, if I could first address the question of the prosecutor's summation that you raised a little earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.663" offset="4563246">The Sixth Circuit was plainly troubled by what it thought the prosecutor had said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.048" offset="4584771">My suggestion is that it is overreading the prosecutor's summation to suggest, as the Court of Appeals did, that he in effect tied together the inadmissible, and the concededly inadmissible, Williams statement with the defendant's testimony in her direct case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.362" offset="4658019">It's clear on its face that he at no time referred to the Williams statement as such in making his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.950" offset="4688425">Indeed, he gave his own limiting instruction as a preface to the jury, telling them that it would be quite unfair to make that connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.722" offset="4723534">I think this Court has stressed in cases like Donnelly against DiChristifaro that it is wrong to read an otherwise ambiguous remark in the prosecutor's summation in its worst possible light.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.446" offset="4770345">But I don't think you even have to rely on that ordinary presumption to read the prosecutor's summation as nothing more than an attack on Ms. Marsh's credibility when she denied having heard what happened in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.254" offset="4821650">Now, that was testimony that she freely gave and would not otherwise have been in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1177.959" offset="4860415">Why would that impeach her credibility, other than relating to the fact that she might have been trying to disassociate herself with the statement in the confession?</text>

            <text syncTime="1186.131" offset="4893121">Well, in the context of the summation, I think it's important to be clear that prior to this particular remark by the prosecutor in summation he had been going through various parts of her testimony and the other evidence at trial to show that in fact she did know about a plan in advance: that she had used, for example, coded language that matched others, language that various of the other confederates had used.</text>

            <text syncTime="1214.349" offset="5005970">But the particular fact of an attempt to kill the woman who ran the numbers game, the only evidence of that is the particular remark in the finding, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1226.375" offset="5054139">I think a jury could fairly conclude that what Ms. Marsh did at the scene of the crime, not only the language that she used, but the way she behaved, is as entirely consistent with having worked out a plan in advance as with the opposite, and given the inference, that inferences ought to be drawn in favor of the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.587" offset="5134910">It seems to me, for example, that her having grabbed Cynthia Knighton and her child when they tried to escape, at a time when she knew that the confederates had drawn guns, had forced people on their knees or face down on the floor, at that point for her to have prevented these two people's escape strikes me as entirely consistent with having been in on a plan to see to it that those people would not live to tell the tale.</text>

            <text syncTime="1276.306" offset="5253819">But it would also be consistent with just wanting to carry out the robbery, I suppose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1289.866" offset="5308050">But it strikes me that, given the presumptions that attend a jury conviction, a verdict, it seems to me this was sufficient evidence for us not to be concerned that ambiguous remarks in a prosecutor's summation gave rise to the use of inadmissible evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1387.962" offset="5700409">The bottom line I think is that compared in particular to the kinds of cases in which courts have justifiably chastised prosecutors for making that impermissible link... and I'd suggest as a good comparison the Second Circuit's decision in U.S. against Rodriguez in 555 F. 2d at 316 to 317 is an example that really makes this case pale by comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.347" offset="5798002">I'd like, however, to turn my focus for a few minutes on the idea of redaction in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.251" offset="5825588">This Court when it decided Bruton in fact indicated that one alternative way of placing a co-defendant's confession before a jury in a joint trial was through redacting references to the defendant, a point picked up by the American Bar Association in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.343" offset="5889953">And while the Court in terms has never said precisely what kinds of redactions will satisfy the rule in Bruton, a good deal of what the Court has said ought to focus trial courts and courts of appeals' attentions on the appropriate standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.139" offset="5953170">We take as our point of departure the remarks and the holding of the plurality in Parker against Raldolph: number one, that Bruton is a narrow exception to the premise of jury competence, that juries follow instructions;--</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.546" offset="6006773">And second, that as a narrow exception Bruton ought to be tied closely to its facts, and those facts are important for the purposes of what is a sufficient redaction, because the facts of Bruton deal with a co-defendant's confession that named Bruton by name and made it as clear as could be that he was a participant in the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.126" offset="6089111">It seems to us that when you redact a confession and when you move away from the paradigm that Bruton was expressly dealing with, it makes all the difference in the world; and that there's increasingly less reason to fear--</text>

            <text syncTime="1527.389" offset="6258175">--It is a factor, of course, that the defendants have been charged together and sit at counsel table together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.376" offset="6282104">But that fact I take it was equally true in Parker against Raldolph, in which quite a number of confessing defendants were sitting at the same table.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.314" offset="6317839">And yet, the Court recognized that there were circumstances that were capable of attenuating the powerfully incriminating nature of the co-defendant's confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.837" offset="6355978">And I suggest that there are a variety of ways in which redaction can serve the purposes that Bruton was concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.674" offset="6383250">At the first level, if redaction goes so far as to eliminate any reference to the existence of another participant in the crime, we believe that there ought to be a per se rule that Bruton is not violated by the admission of that kind of redacted statement, and that rule covers this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.588" offset="6462975">But it doesn't cover every case because, as this Court recognized in Bruton, as Justice White observed in his Bruton dissent, and as the Court observed in Tennessee against Street, sometimes you can't redact quite that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.629" offset="6515116">And in a great number of cases, the redactions consist of using blanks or symbols or pronouns to take the place of the name of the complaining defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.687" offset="6555344">In this area, it's harder to craft a per se rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.072" offset="6568928">But we think again that this Court's decisions point the way to resolving this larger number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.126" offset="6593065">We think the general rule should look like this: that redactions that use blanks, symbols, or pronouns or their equivalents are sufficient under Bruton unless the trial court is persuaded by defense counsel in the exercise of its discretion that it is virtually obvious that the name missing from the redacted confession belongs to the complaining defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1681.889" offset="6876128">And I think this case presents the situation in which we have every reason to think that that's not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.126" offset="6901101">For example, suppose instead of leaving out Ms. Marsh's name entirely or even her existence in the Williams confession, they had used an A, as the prosecutor had originally planned to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.034" offset="6952719">The only evidence that linked Ms. Marsh to this crime apart from the Williams confession, which was inadmissible, was Cynthia Knighton's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.556" offset="6986783">She said nothing about the car ride, because of course she was not a party to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.126" offset="7013114">So there was no other evidence that put her into the car, and I suggest that the jury would not have ineluctably reached the conclusion that she drove over with the other two people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.918" offset="7056268">And therefore, I think it's not inconsistent to say on the one hand that it may not be perfectly obvious who the missing person is, and yet on the other hand that there's proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the complaining defendant is guilty as charged.</text>

            <text syncTime="1868.857" offset="7624066">She is unable to challenge that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.390" offset="7630126">She is unable to challenge the existence of this alleged statement of Martin through cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.761" offset="7651651">So the only way that she can challenge it, if at all, is to waive her Fifth Amendment, take the stand, and set forth herself the circumstances of what went on in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.135" offset="7693134">Unfortunately, even under those circumstances she can't go to the very heart of the question, which is whether Martin even made the statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1904.531" offset="7766695">The key to this case, I believe, is elucidating what Bruton meant by the phrase "powerfully incriminating".</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.702" offset="7807446">It said that, the case said that the confrontation clause would be violated when a co-defendant's statement was powerfully incriminating as to the non-confessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.010" offset="7856660">It's our position that Bruton necessarily has to involve looking at the statement in context, because the focus of Bruton was not whether the statement named the defendant, but how much eight it added to the prosecutor's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.006" offset="7940670">I believe the language was a statement is powerfully incriminating when it adds substantial, perhaps critical, weight to the prosecutor's case in a form not subject to cross-examination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2080.156" offset="8469179">Because, Justice Scalia, in this corner the end result is that the defendant is denied the right of confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.576" offset="8498959">And the result that flows from that is that we have a very serious question about the integrity of the truth-finding process and the reliability of the verdict.</text>

            <text syncTime="2097.316" offset="8537829">And I think that's no more than a statement that I believe the Petitioner would agree with, that redaction doesn't work in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.223" offset="8577535">In any trial, things can happen during the course of the trial which can make an ostensibly neutral statement incriminating in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.531" offset="8622779">My point is that when we fashion a rule to deal with an imperfect world, we should ask ourselves the question, who should bear the onus if during the course of the trial the redaction blows up?</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.124" offset="8685055">You have to remember, in our case there was a pretrial motion for severance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.445" offset="8706371">The defendant consistently challenged... even after redaction, she continued her objections to the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.864" offset="8736046">And again, referring to the ABA standards that the Solicitor General spoke of, I believe that the correct rule would be that once a defendant makes a motion for severance, challenges the co-defendant's statement, the prosecutor then has an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.576" offset="8810861">There's a number of things that he can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.028" offset="8820683">He can agree to a separate trial, and in this case I submit that he had good reason to believe that the statement... that there was a potential for spillover.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.502" offset="8866659">He could agree to a separate jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.454" offset="8878466">He could agree to a joint trial where the statement wasn't used, or he could choose the option of redaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.707" offset="8911485">Now, where he chooses redaction and where the situation blows up because of events that occur later in trial, I think it is the prosecutor who should bear the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.467" offset="8970521">He is certainly the beneficiary of the joint trial rule, and I think that it is he that should bear the risk if things blow up, particularly if as a result we have powerfully incriminating evidence to add substantial weight to his case that comes in untested by cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.582" offset="9066966">There are a number of factors in our case that I believe combine to create the risk that Bruton spoke of, that the jury would misuse the evidence in spite of cautionary instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.092" offset="9128928">First of all, the cornerstone of the prosecutor's case in relation to the murder charge was that there was a preconceived and prediscussed plan to not only rob but to kill the victims, and that this discussion, this plan, was hatched before they ever got over to the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.707" offset="9223387">That was his theory as to both defendants, and arguing Clarissa Marsh's case to the jury I counted new fewer than 13 times that he told the jury that Clarissa Marsh was part of the plan, that she was in on the planning stages of the robbery and the killing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2471.039" offset="10032765">And when you get to the point where this is the only direct evidence... and in fact, when the prosecutor was arguing Williams' case to the jury he, of course and properly so, referred to Williams' statement that Kareem Martin discussed the plan and said, yes, this is direct evidence of intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2785.607" offset="11291031">In our case, in fact, the problem from the very beginning, the problem that the prosecutor created in insisting on the joint trial, I think ineluctably led to the argument that he made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.236" offset="11357591">It was difficult for him, if he was going to challenge Clarissa Marsh's testimony, to not say it, to not say, oh, she's not telling the truth, or she has to say that because otherwise you're not going to believe that she's part of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.031" offset="11428748">Not only the defendant, but perhaps he was in somewhat of a trap, of his own making.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.351" offset="11449960">And again, I think we have to look at the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.167" offset="11457274">The result was that the risk was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.021" offset="11480680">That's all Bruton talks about, the risk that the jury would misuse the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.259" offset="11505653">The rule that I suggest for this Court is analogous to that which Justice Blackmun discussed in his concurrence in Parker v. Randolph, and that is to acknowledge that there are circumstances where redaction doesn't work and where a redacted statement can become powerfully incriminating, violating Bruton, and then subjected to a harmless error analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.958" offset="11600425">One can... Harrington versus California comes to mind, which incidentally did involve a redacted confession, where this Court made a statement that, well, even though the defendant's statement was taken out, the circumstances of the case could make it as clear as pointing and shouting that the defendant was included in the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.438" offset="11678375">I think, at least tacitly, this Court has recognized since Bruton that statements can become incriminating in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.108" offset="11705019">And as long as we subject that to the harmless error rule of Harrington, I think we have a workable rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.381" offset="11734172">I think we have a rule which fairly protects the right of confrontation and at the same time doesn't put a particularly unworkable burden on the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.838" offset="11783909">Certainly not only the Sixth Circuit, but the Seventh Circuit, the Second Circuit, the D.C. Circuit, have over the last ten years all endorsed rules which would allow for looking at a redacted statement in context, and life goes on in Chicago and New York, both cities which have their fair share of joint trials.</text>

            <text syncTime="3361.139" offset="13593150">You can argue facts not in evidence, and I suppose in a sense that's a violation of confrontation because nobody ever even testified to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.393" offset="13618228">We don't usually analyze it in that context, and we require an objection to preserve it and that it be raised in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.166" offset="13645290">And I really think it should be viewed as a separate question than in the question right before us, whether the prosecutor erred in his argument as opposed to whether or not severance should have been granted in this case.</text>
