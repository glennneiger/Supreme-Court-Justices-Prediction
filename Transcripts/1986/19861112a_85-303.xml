            <text syncTime="14.174" offset="212506">This case is here on a petition for certiorari to the Missouri Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.628" offset="230374">The State submits that the court below erred in its construction of the Fourth Amendment when it required the suppression of the respondent's palm print taken while in police custody; and that it erred in the suppression of the respondent's confession, as the fruit of the poisonous tree.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.471" offset="293695">This case raises the issue of whether an arrest on a warrant can be invalidated because of the subjective state of mind of the officer making the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.327" offset="329117">The facts of this case presented to the courts below are that the respondent was a suspect in a November, 1981 homicide, and that Kansas City detectives had wanted to compare her palm print to a palm print found at the murder scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.503" offset="389826">When they discovered that a warrant, a parking warrant, had been issued by the Municipal Division of the Circuit Court of Jakcson County some two weeks before she had become a suspect... two weeks after... two weeks after she had become a suspect, they arrested the respondent on the parking warrant and asked her to accompany them on a pick-up order on the homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.785" offset="487001">They took her to the main police station where they left her in the custody of the detention unit officers, with directions to hold her for the crimes against persons unit and the warrant service unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.426" offset="533499">After that, she was then taken by the homicide detectives involved in the homicide investigation; explained her rights under the Miranda case, which she then waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.400" offset="581460">And she was questioned about the homicide and denied any knowledge of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.435" offset="593581">The next morning she was again taken by the homicide detectives and explained her rights under the Miranda case, which she waived again.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.708" offset="626704">And again, they questioned her, and she denied any knowledge of the homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.993" offset="639765">She was then booked on the parking warrant, made a bond, and was released; later appeared on the parking violation and pled guilty and paid a $15 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.683" offset="674560">Meanwhile, it turned out that her palm print matched the one found at the scene.</text>

            <text syncTime="1923.026" offset="7847889">Or rather, is the conflict that they're talking about the conflict as to whether it was, or if it wasn't, whether it was pretextual?</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.863" offset="7875266">It seems to me that it was both, because if you read further on in that paragraph, it discusses other Missouri cases that deal with pretext.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.683" offset="7902537">And it concludes the paragraph by saying: Such pretextual use to justify an arrest or search has been clearly recognized as violative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.039" offset="7935974">And that all is in the same paragraph whose topic sentence is: The conflicts thus raised by the evidence were for the trial court to resolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.192" offset="7964604">I read that as saying, we don't know whether the arrest was on the parking warrant or not, but even if it was, it was pretextual.</text>

            <text syncTime="3437.165" offset="13904431">With respect to the second submission of the respondent, he's indicated that it would be wrong to take someone into custody for the wrong reason, even if you had a perfectly valid reason to arrest and fingerprint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.409" offset="13957408">And his reason, as stated, is that you do it for the wrong reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.277" offset="13972977">The State submits here that what that means is that part of the... that the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment is no longer met by having a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.566" offset="14014041">You've got to have a warrant plus proper and pure motivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.072" offset="14040059">And it seems to me that that flies in the face of the basic fundamental... the fundamental jurisprudence of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.326" offset="14073078">If you have a valid warrant, you ought to be able to execute the warrant without looking at the reason behind the execution of the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.748" offset="14106828">Furthermore, all of the things that the respondent has complained about here happened after the respondent was in custody, and after the fingerprints had already been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.591" offset="14162208">Those fingerprints were not the fruit of an overnight detention, and they were not the fruit of any questioning on the homicide.</text>

            <text syncTime="3518.053" offset="14228036">The arrest was at least partially, or facially, on the arrest warrant is borne out by Officer Stewart's testimony where he testified at the hearing, seven different times, both on direct and cross-examination, that he had arrested her on the outstanding parking warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.979" offset="14287700">In addition to which, the booking record that we have referred to also refers to the warrant as being a reason for her detention, and Officer Thomas' police report, written the same day, also refers to that same parking warrant, denominating it by number, as to one of the reasons why she was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.607" offset="14358231">So I think the reference if replete with references to this parking warrant at the time of the arrest; not later.</text>
