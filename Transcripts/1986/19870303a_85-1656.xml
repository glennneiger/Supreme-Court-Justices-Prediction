            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="131584">We will hear argument next in No. 85-1656, James A. Lynaugh, Interim Director, Texas Department of Corrections, versus Gregory Allen Petty.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Palmer</label>
            <text syncTime="78.922" offset="447248">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a statutory habeas corpus case brought by a Texas prisoner serving a 50-year sentence for aggravated robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.278" offset="492596">The first question presented is whether the petitioner was required to plead prejudice in order to avoid dismissal of the Sixth Amendment claim by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.820" offset="538781">I believe it is clear under Strickland versus Washington and Hill versus Lockhart that he was required to do so, and I do not intend to dwell on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.582" offset="577860">I believe the important question for the Court's decision is the propriety of the Fifth Circuit's disposition of the new issues which Petty raised on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.110" offset="615999">Petty was tried on his plea of not guilty and convicted in state court in 1979, and his conviction was affirmed by the state appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.573" offset="657795">He then filed a state application for collateral relief, raising two grounds, one of which was that his counsel's representation had been constitutionally inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.991" offset="699486">The convicting court found that Petty had not pled facts which would entitle his to relief and recommended that the writ be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.489" offset="733445">The state appellate court denied the writ on this basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.159" offset="748178">Petty then filed a habeas petition in Federal District Court in which he raised six claims, including ineffective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.156" offset="784123">Petty's federal claim was couched in the same conclusory terms as had been his state claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.121" offset="808051">Accordingly, the state's answer pointed out that Petty had not alleged facts which if true would entitle him to habeas relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.759" offset="838562">The magistrate to whom the case was referred agreed and recommended denial of the writ because Petty's pleadings were insufficient under existing Fifth Circuit law.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.880" offset="883075">Petty did not object to the magistrate's recommendation, and it was adopted by the District Court, which denied the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.518" offset="909615">On appeal to the Fifth Circuit Petty raised for the first time in any court specific factual allegations as to his counsel's performance and how it allegedly affected the outcome of his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.184" offset="956217">The Fifth Circuit reversed and remanded, holding that Petty should be allowed the opportunity to amend his petition in the court below to include the allegation that counsel should have investigated a possible defense of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.397" offset="1017135">The Court of Appeals recognized the general rule that issues raised for the first time on appeal ordinarily are not considered, but ignored the rule because in its words, the fact that Petty has now made these allegations indicates that he would make them in the District Court if he were given the opportunity to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.312" offset="1092786">The problem with this standard is that it is no standard at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.683" offset="1106265">There will never be a case where new issues are raised on appeal that will not come within this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.416" offset="1129148">Under the reasoning of the Court of Appeals, habeas petitioners are entitled to a remand as a matter of right whenever they bring forth new issues on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.238" offset="1176482">We believe the Court of Appeals approach is contrary to the admonitions of this Court as expressed, for example, In Rose v. Lundy, that habeas petitioners should marshall all their claims in a single petition and make but one trip to the state and federal courts in seeking relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.358" offset="1252968">What is worse, under the reasoning of the Court of Appeals there is absolutely nothing to prevent Petty from bringing forth additional new issues on a subsequent appeal and obtaining yet another remand with directions to allow him to amend.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.180" offset="1316289">The end result is that there will be absolutely no semblance of finality in criminal cases.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="302.099" offset="1339904">General Palmer, what it really boils down to, isn't it, that you want to be able to argue effectively that there is an abuse of the writ because even it they had just not taken this disposition, he could still have filed a second habeas petition, but you would have claimed it would be an abuse of the writ if he had?</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="319.701" offset="1410330">But why can't you still argue on remand to the District Court that there is an abuse of the writ here because he should have raised these things the first time around?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_a_palmer" startTime="327.197" stopTime="357.406">
            <label>Mr. Charles A. Palmer</label>
            <text syncTime="327.197" offset="1440319">We could argue that.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.431" offset="1449305">I believe it would be futile.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.650" offset="1458082">I can't imagine the District Court granting our motion when the remand with directions to allow an amendment was expressly ordered by a higher court.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.631" offset="1502072">If the Court of Appeals had followed the normal procedure and simply affirmed the District Court without reaching this issue, Petty would have had to initiate a new lawsuit in order to raise this claim.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="357.406" stopTime="373.055">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="357.406" offset="1561109">Then should we really construe what the Court of Appeals has done as in effect holding that given the particular history of this case we don't think it would be an abuse of the writ for him now to raise these issues so let's just have him raise them in this case instead of filing a new proceeding?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_a_palmer" startTime="373.055" stopTime="439.936">
            <label>Mr. Charles A. Palmer</label>
            <text syncTime="373.055" offset="1623803">No, Your Honor, the abuse issue was never raised by either party.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.054" offset="1643760">It was not briefed.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.976" offset="1647417">Whether or not a petitioner has abused the writ is a factual issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.959" offset="1667375">The burden is on the state to plead abuse of the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.801" offset="1678764">Once the state has done so the burden then shifts to the petitioner to shot that he was unaware of a particular claim or claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.892" offset="1707081">None of this has been developed in the District Court or in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.985" offset="1723486">What the District Court did was simply give Petty an end run around the abuse doctrine and it spells it out quite clearly in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.620" offset="1762043">It says once the case is remanded to the District Court the state will be allowed to plead failure to exhaust state remedies because it is clear Petty has not exhausted his state remedies as to these claims, If the state does so the District Court will have to dismiss on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.286" offset="1832678">Its dismissal will be without prejudice, and then Petty rill be free to initiate a new lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.470" offset="1853367">I think the only fair reading of what the Court of Appeals did is to relieve Petty of his burden of justifying not bringing this claim earlier.</text>

            <text syncTime="439.936" offset="1891297">Why couldn't you argue in the Court of Appeals that allowing this amendment would be an abuse of the writ?</text>
            <text syncTime="452.336" offset="1940825">And also you could argue if there hasn't been any exhaustion of this particular issue, you could argue there was no exhaustion.</text>

            <text syncTime="467.941" offset="2003310">In remanding to the District Court it opined that perhaps the state would wish to waive the exhaustion defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="678.834" offset="2846856">Precisely, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.865" offset="2851035">Now, Justice White has suggested that perhaps once Petty was allowed to amend, we could have pleaded abuse at that point, and perhaps we could, but once the Fifth Circuit had sanctioned the amendment it is very difficult to conceive that the District Court would sustain the state's abuse argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.765" offset="2918640">Petty makes several arguments in this Court to uphold the propriety of the Fifth Circuit's disposition, the first of which is that the District Court's dismissal was due to a defect in pleadings and therefore was not on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.758" offset="2986559">We do not believe that is an accurate statement of how habeas cases are disposed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.802" offset="3014771">In a habeas case such as this, when the District Court considers the pleadings and the state court record, its decision to deny relief necessarily goes to the merits of the petitioner's claim, and the dismissal then is with prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.889" offset="3087078">The dismissal with prejudice on this record in no sense is unfair to habeas petitioners, however, because unlike ordinary civil suits there is no principle of res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.804" offset="3146742">Habeas petitioners are free to re-litigate the constitutionality of their convictions again and again subject only to the abuse of the writ doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.302" offset="3176730">Petty also argues that the District Court abused its discretion in not ordering discovery under Rule 6 or expansion of the record under Rule 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.674" offset="3218213">Of course, the District Court was under no duty to do so, and given the vague and conclusory nature of Petty's allegations there was simply nothing to suggest to it that utilization of those rules would be appropriate in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.417" offset="3273174">Finally, Petty argues that he was not put on sufficient notice of the inadequacy of his pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.929" offset="3311208">Petty filed his federal petition on March the 7th, 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.333" offset="3332838">More than seven months previously when the state convicting court filed its findings, it noted that he had not pled sufficient facts to justify relief on a Sixth Amendment claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.517" offset="3377560">The forum which Petty used to file his federal writ instructed him that it was necessary to raise all the facts in support of each of the claims, and even advised him that it is permissible to attach additional pages to include the facts if necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.416" offset="3445164">Both the state's answer and the magistrate's report pointed out to Petty that he had not pied sufficient facts to justify relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.506" offset="3473586">Given this record, it is at best disingenuous to suggest that Petty was not afforded an opportunity to plead his case in the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2112.168" offset="8580211">He alleged facts which from his perspective were factual.</text>

            <text syncTime="2131.643" offset="8658056">It may help, to answer Your Honor's question, to change the language of the form to the extent of asking the petitioner to explain why it is that an error of counsel affected the outcome of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.481" offset="8733497">That may have gotten Mr. Petty over the hurdle by bringing his attention to the need to address that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.805" offset="8766725">One of the circumstances that was involved in this case was that Mr. Petty had filed his petition before this Court's decisions in Strickland and Hill versus Lockhart, so that not necessarily that he would have paid any attention to those decisions, but when the Fifth Circuit considers his petition they are aware that those pleading standards were in flux at the time that Mr. Petty's pleading was being considered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2291.501" offset="9297533">It enables Petty to be heard on his expanded plea of ineffective assistance, and that is a plea that goes to the very guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.652" offset="9342151">It protects the state to a certain extent from piecemeal litigation by addressing that issue directly as quickly as possible, and in the interest of the court system it provides an opportunity for Mr. Petty's claim to be resolved quickly and efficiently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.006" offset="9403591">In these respects remand was a reasonable exercise of the court's power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.488" offset="9425533">It considered the circumstances, and it balanced the interest from its perspective in its discretion of those interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.891" offset="9459075">Whatever this Court does with this case is going to send a signal, of course, to the Circuit Courts about the way that they handle complex problems such as pro se litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.323" offset="9512782">That signal should not be to tie their hands in a way to prevent them from addressing questions that were raised on appeal if the merits of the case support that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.380" offset="9565027">The message should instead be to let the judges do their job, the Circuit Judges to do their job as best as they see fit.</text>
