            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="144339">We will hear arguments next in No. 85-2064, Greer against Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.169" offset="181015">Mr. Rotert, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_l_rotert" startTime="13.964" stopTime="185.166">
            <label>Mr. Mark L. Rotert</label>
            <text syncTime="13.964" offset="200137">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.167" offset="208914">Your Honors, the petitioners have raised three issues for consideration by the Court in their briefs, but today I'm only going to discuss the first and the second issue, and I'd like to divide my time roughly equally between the two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.256" offset="257292">First, today, I'd like to discuss the first issue in the brief, and that question is whether or not it is always inappropriate to attempt to apply the standards of Chapman v. California to an asserted violation of due process of law that arose under the rule of Doyle v. Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.514" offset="318315">And the petitioner's position in this regard may be very succinctly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.794" offset="335451">We believe that it is an oxymoron, and an inherently contradictory statement, to say on the one end that error occurred which was so serious that it rose to the level of a deprivation of due process of law, that is, it rendered the trial fundamentally unfair, but then on the other hand to say, we're now going to analyze that error and determine whether it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.504" offset="434298">It would appear that the use of terminology that an error rose to the level of creating fundamental unfairness answers the question of whether or not the conviction may stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.000" offset="480274">The conviction may not stand in the face of such fundamental unfairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.061" offset="496574">Now, there are, in light of that conclusion, two possible results that can obtain when there's been a violation of the rule in Doyle v. Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.713" offset="535131">I think the first potential result was that apparently accepted by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, the majority of the en banc, and also appears to have been accepted by the respondents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.161" offset="580897">That theory seems to operate on the premise that once a prosecutor utters the language that is condemned under Doyle, that is in this case, once the prosecutor said, why didn't you tell anyone this story when you got arrested, the deprivation of due process is complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.780" offset="647457">The violation of fundamental fairness is apparent, and there's no more analysis to be had in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.152" offset="672848">Well, if that were in fact the rule, it would be an unusually harsh rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.667" offset="686955">It would read more facts into Doyle than Doyle itself contains.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.760" offset="703359">It would create a rule that was disproportionate to the harm suffered by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.619" offset="722795">And it would violate this Court's tradition that due process clause cases are not designed to deter prosecutorial misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.786" offset="751425">Therefore, we submit that the more appropriate analysis in this case is to examine a violation of the Doyle rule, and to treat that examination in what we might refer to as the traditional due process model.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.688" offset="807013">This would require that a defendant would bear the burden of showing that when the Doyle violation is assessed in the context of the entirety of the trial, that but for the Doyle error, the results of that proceeding would probably have been different.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.041" offset="868453">If a defendant makes such a showing under Doyle v. Ohio--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="185.166" offset="884963">Why is that any less logically absurd?</text>

            <text syncTime="192.491" offset="914220">I mean isn't... isn't... you've just told us, once you find a Doyle violation, that's the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.146" offset="928848">And once you find that there has been a lack of fundamental unfairness, there's been a lack of fundamental unfairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.441" offset="950060">It seems to me the logic of your position is that you don't make any kind of a harmless error inquiry.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_l_rotert" startTime="206.893" stopTime="255.656">
            <label>Mr. Mark L. Rotert</label>
            <text syncTime="206.893" offset="971898">--Well, I don't equate the violation of Doyle rules with a violation of due process such as creates a fundamental unfairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.858" offset="1007738">I believe if Doyle is read as a case that was decided on the basis of its own unique facts, Doyle makes some implicit assumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.932" offset="1043996">One of the implicit assumptions in Doyle is that post-Miranda warning silence were used by the jury to draw negative inferences about defendant Doyle's credibility; that resulted in a breach of the implicit promise of Miranda, and rendered the trial fundamentally unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.629" offset="1114840">But by describing Doyle in that fashion, Justice Scalla, I hope I have demonstrated that there are more elements to Doyle than merely looking to see whether the prosecutor commented, in the presence of the jury, on post-Miranda warning silence.</text>

            <text syncTime="258.310" offset="1177534">So every Doyle violation is not a Doyle violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="279.945" offset="1264052">No, It's not precisely a harmless error inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.708" offset="1275128">I would analogize it to the Strickland v. Washington inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.801" offset="1287457">Before you determine whether there is a violation, you must assess prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.206" offset="1305116">Prejudice is a necessary component of declaring that there has been a violation of due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.766" offset="1327372">Now I think that this... this proposition that I proffered to the Court this afternoon is reflected by a comparison of the facts of Doyle with the facts of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="305.699" offset="1367079">Does this argument that you're now making apply equally whether the challenge is made on direct review or on collateral attack?</text>

            <text syncTime="312.525" offset="1394350">It does, Justice Stevens, and I appreciate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.415" offset="1405949">My first argument says that Doyle violations have a prejudice requirement no matter what the context in which they're raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.413" offset="1429981">My second argument talks about the specific application of Chapman v. California, in the context of habeas review.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.098" offset="1456731">It's an assuming arguendo.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.801" offset="1463523">If the Court doesn't believe me when I say that there's a prejudice component to Doyle, if the Court agrees with the majority, in fact, the unanimous weight of the Federal circuits, that Chapman applies to Doyle, then I think we have to take a look at whether or not Chapman serves a utilitarian function in habeas corpus, and we'd like to--</text>

            <text syncTime="353.137" offset="1556832">I think I'm understanding you to say, we shouldn't treat a Doyle error as a determination in and of itself that there has been any error of a constitutional nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.786" offset="1615451">You are asking us to reexamine Doyle in a sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="372.284" offset="1633423">And I thought the questions presented asked us to reexamine the remedy for a Doyle error, to wit, whether we apply the Chapman standard upon this error.</text>

            <text syncTime="384.951" offset="1684101">--Well, I think that it... the question presented for review in the cert petition, if I may, was, whether, when considering violations of Doyle in Federal habeas corpus proceedings, which takes me to the second point, the standard of review should be whether the error substantially affected the course of the trial, rather than whether the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.210" offset="1761110">My position this afternoon, Justice O'Connor, is that the question should be answered that the error must substantially affect the course of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.942" offset="1792039">Please understand, I'm not requiring or even requesting that the Court reexamine Doyle in its rationale.</text>

            <text syncTime="418.955" offset="1820146">Well, it strikes me that might be a better idea than to set up some new standard, other than Chapman, if you find there has been a violation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.373" offset="1861733">I'm just trying to understand what it is you're arguing.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark L. Rotert</label>
            <text syncTime="432.373" offset="1873750">I don't believe we're looking for a new standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.199" offset="1881064">I believe we're looking for... at faithful adherence to Doyle, but I don't believe that Doyle was a case in which this Court had an opportunity to discuss both what elements constitute a violation and what remedial steps are required if there's been a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.709" offset="1943131">I think that the case is one that was decided on its own facts, and including in those facts, I would remind the Court, the State of Ohio expressly declined to ask the Court for a remedial determination, a determination of what remedy should obtain if there is a deprivation of constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.906" offset="2007915">So in that sense, we're not asking for a reanalysis of Doyle.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.138" offset="2020871">We're not asking... or attacking the fundamental premise of Doyle.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.637" offset="2034873">We're saying that Doyle is subject to misconstruction because of the facts and circumstances it raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.057" offset="2064548">Those facts and circumstances made a complete deprivation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.085" offset="2084610">What happened in Doyle was that the defendant was cross-examined at some length about his post warning silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.021" offset="2108329">And as Justice Stevens once noted, he gave a jumble of answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.129" offset="2120763">He got hurt on cross-examination because of his post warning silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.252" offset="2137273">In the context of that case, it should also be noted, that the prosecutor argued that issue frequently on closing arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.063" offset="2160574">He directed to the jury the inference that they should draw, he said, was that there was a concocted or fabricated story.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.482" offset="2190249">I think that the Court in Doyle had no occasion to stop and consider when, if at all--</text>

            <text syncTime="681.848" offset="2871627">But the point that I'm drawing is that unless this Court has reason to conclude that the jury actually inferred negative things about this respondent's post warning silence, there is no reason on which you could conclude that there was a breach of the promise implicit in Miranda.</text>

            <text syncTime="799.930" offset="3344026">Your Honors, the second issue that the petitioners have briefed, and that I would like to discuss this afternoon is whether, assuming, as we are willing to assume for the second argument, that a Doyle violation gets Chapman analysis, we submit that there are significant policy reasons why the Chapman v. California stringent standards, to demonstrate that error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, do not provide adequate utility in collateral review to justify their application.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.479" offset="3474220">Now, Your Honors, it's fair to say that over the last three or four decades, two general theories have obtained in this Court concerning the essential focus of the purpose of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.022" offset="3524375">On the one hand there has been the theory expressed that habeas corpus is necessary to keep the state courts in line, to make sure that they honor the principles and precedents that are issued by this Court on the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.048" offset="3580486">A second theory that's been noted by the Court in various cases more recently says that, no, the essential purpose of habeas corpus is to see to it that there are no fundamentally unjust convictions obtained in the state courts in individual cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.667" offset="3634925">We believe we are demonstrating a proposition to the Court this afternoon that materially advances both of those interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.804" offset="3663555">Now, Your Honors, we state it as follows: There should be a rule from this Court, based upon the facts of this case, that states, where a state court identifies correctly the underlying constitutional principle that's at issue in a criminal trial, where it applies the governing precedent that's on point as issued by this Court, and if it determines the constitutional error arose, it then determines that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under Chapman v. California, then when that same case comes to the Federal habeas corpus court and the Federal judge agrees about the underlying principle having been correctly identified, agrees that the governing principle or precedent was applied by the state court, the only question then remaining for the Federal District Court judge is whether or not the petitioner in that habeas corpus case can demonstrate, on his burden, that absent the error the results of the proceeding would probably have been different.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.981" offset="3916212">And even if it were a violation of Griffin v. California, the kind of case that initially gave rise to Chapman v. California, if the state court had afforded a Chapman analysis on direct review, no useful purpose is served by permitting or requiring a Federal court to indulge in that analysis on collateral review.</text>

            <text syncTime="988.777" offset="4099382">Yes, because this Court has reaffirmed only last week that the scope of habeas corpus jurisdiction, as a matter of potential power, is extraordinarily broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.806" offset="4135536">But that power being as broad as it is does not mean that this Court will give the habeas corpus jurisdiction its widest possible scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.834" offset="4163643">This Court in any number of contexts has said, even though we have the jurisdictional power to act, we will act according to our assessment of what it means under the interests of finality and under the interests of comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.985" offset="4216202">So while you would have the power to require Federal courts to give us a Chapman analysis on habeas, you also have the power to say we shall not exercise that jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.965" offset="4256117">Now I want to emphasize that there's a misconception on the part of the opponents in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.260" offset="4277328">We do not assert, by the argument we raise to that Court today, that any change should be made in those constitutional cases which would now result in a per se reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.646" offset="4326857">For example, if someone had no attorney under the Gideon case, that's a per se reversal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.473" offset="4350158">And if under some unfortunate circumstance, that escaped the notice of the state court, on Federal court per se reversal rules would remain viable for application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.155" offset="4388923">But what we're talking about are the applications of Chapman v. California to habeas corpus cases where the state court has already made that subjective, fact-rooted factual determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1320.584" offset="5426612">Mr. Justice White, of the two arguments, I think that the problems associated with application of Chapman on habeas corpus are more significant to the various 50 states than the problems associated with a rather inaccurate reading of what Doyle v. Ohio purports to say about the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.999" offset="5504248">Now, one of the things that's noteworthy about the Chapman standard is, according to this Court and according to the lower courts, is, that if a state in this case wants to show that error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we have to show Mr. Miller's guilt by virtue of overwhelming evidence, a quotation taken directly from any number of decisions by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.491" offset="5590243">If we're going to apply that overwhelming evidence standard on collateral review, it should be because the need to enforce Chapman on collateral review outweighs the costs that are associated with that enforcement of Chapman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.204" offset="5641129">But in point of fact, that's not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.266" offset="5649384">The benefits of applying Chapman on collateral review are illusory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.092" offset="5664639">There is no dispute here between the Illinois appellate court, the Illinois trial court, and the Illinois Supreme Court, all three of which said Doyle error occurred, and the Seventh Circuit, either en banc or in panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.617" offset="5714795">Nobody has ever disputed the presence of a Doyle error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.695" offset="5727020">All we've ever done is quibble back and forth about the facts of this case and the meaning to be drawn from those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.801" offset="5751470">If it is true, as this Court has noted, that some tension arises under our notion of a Federal system, by virtue of a fact... by virtue of a Federal court vacating a conviction because it disagrees with a state court on the Constitution, how much more pronounced is that friction between the two jurisdictions when the vacation of the conviction arises because fair-minded judges in the Federal judiciary read facts and draw different conclusions than the fair-minded judges of the state judiciary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1537.034" offset="6292414">The state has suggested that this Court adopt a broad presumption in favor of harmless error in Doyle cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.937" offset="6324075">In so doing, the state has not mentioned what occurred at trial in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.074" offset="6344555">I believe an examination of what occurred at trial will reveal why such a broad presumption should not be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.274" offset="6377364">At trial in this case the prosecutor characterized the evidence as a credibility contest between the state's accomplice witness, Randy Williams, and the defendant, Charles Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.240" offset="6421250">During his closing argument to the jury, the prosecutor stated, what it really boils down to here is, who told you the story and who told you the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.532" offset="6462419">You either believe Randy Williams or you believe Charles Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.562" offset="6474540">It's as simple as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.703" offset="6479137">Recognizing that the outcome of this case was dependent upon the jury's assessment of the defendant's credibility, the prosecutor commenced his cross-examination by asking, why didn't you tell that story to the police at the time you were arrested?</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.010" offset="6540368">The prosecutor's comment was in blatant violation of this Court's decision in Doyle v. Ohio, and it was extremely prejudicial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1640.291" offset="6705462">But I think the Court indicated in Doyle that the attempt of impeachment with post arrest silence... impeachment doesn't have to be completed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1651.023" offset="6748408">And of course, if the prosecutor reiterated that comment to the jury, we'd have more than one violation; we'd have more than one comment on post Miranda warning silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.785" offset="6791457">In this case, the suggestion of the fact, or the comment that the defendant did not tell his story at the time of his arrest, suggested to the jury that if the defendant were innocent, and if his story were true, he would have told it at the time of his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.889" offset="6859794">And since this case was a credibility contest, that comment was extremely prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.588" offset="6886648">With respect to the Doyle issue presented by the state, and with respect to the harmless error application to that Doyle violation, I think it's clear that the due process clause recognizes not only fundamental fairness in the trial as a whole, but fundamental fairness in the prosecutor's relations and actions within the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.923" offset="6988003">Doyle held it is fundamentally unfair for the police to implicitly promise the defendant, at the time he is given Miranda warnings, that his silence will not be used against him, and then for the prosecutor to come back at trial and in fact use that silence against him to impeach his testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="2531.112" offset="10268773">--Well, it's one thing to say that when you have a presumption of constitutional error, the error occurred in this, you can show that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.078" offset="10312555">There if the evidence is close, if the evidence is conflicting, then it's not harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.060" offset="10336483">And that's the case we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.652" offset="10342857">The evidence is conflicting, and under the State's theory, you have to resolve that conflicting evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.135" offset="10364799">It requires the Federal district judge to go into the record and attempt to resolve the conflicts in the evidence, assess the credibility of witnesses; and he's not able to do that, because he hasn't observed the demeanor of those witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.818" offset="10419552">Now, although I've indicated it's almost impossible to meet this standard, I would say the standard has been met in this case, because not only was this one man's word against another, but there were substantial reasons for disbelieving Randy Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.466" offset="10498128">As the trial court stated during defendant's motion on a directed verdict, the trial court stated that Mr. Williams' testimony is not necessarily credible; and in fact, Williams was an accomplice witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.632" offset="10558837">And as this Court has indicated, accomplice witness testimony is suspect, because of a motive to shift the blame to someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.583" offset="10586631">And the jury in this case was instructed accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.863" offset="10599692">They were instructed that Williams' testimony should be subject to suspicion, and should be scrutinized with care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.049" offset="10628532">It would also indicate that Mr. Williams' testimony with regard to the defendant's involvement in this crime, was implausible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.264" offset="10665312">Williams testified that he, his brother Rick, and Butch Armstrong left a Jacksonville, Illinois tavern at 1:30 one February morning in the company of the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.586" offset="10714631">Williams and his cohorts had been drinking for 12 hours prior to this, and they had recently ingested a narcotic substance known as MDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.286" offset="10749426">According to Williams, they all got into the car, they drove over to his brother Rick's house and left Rick off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.877" offset="10779833">He continued to drive around until Armstrong and Gorsuch, the victim, were in the back seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.436" offset="10801985">During that time, Armstrong administered a severe beating to the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.887" offset="10823823">And they put Randy Williams' stocking hat over the victim's head so the victim could not see where they were taking him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.228" offset="10849214">They took him to Randy Williams' residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.524" offset="10862380">There, they obtained Randy Williams shotgun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.164" offset="10876904">They loaded that shotgun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.367" offset="10881710">They obtained his.32 caliber revolver, which was also loaded, and while at the residence, according to Williams, Armstrong struck the victim over the head with the butt of the shotgun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.427" offset="10926014">There was so much blood, Williams was unable to clean it up with the towel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.848" offset="10943673">He went back, the victim still hooded, they went back in the car, drove around some more, and according to Williams, they finally came to the defendant's residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.047" offset="10980453">Doesn't know what time this is, and the testimony is very vague, but it's still dark out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.905" offset="11003859">According to Williams, Armstrong went in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.386" offset="11013786">He awoke Mr. Miller up from a sound sleep, and Miller comes out to the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.213" offset="11041162">According to Williams, they then drive off to a bridge and take turns shooting the victim in the head with the shotgun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.991" offset="11068225">I submit that it is difficult to believe that an individual who has absolutely no motive to kill the victim would be awakened from a sound sleep in the middle of a cold February night and that within a few minutes be out on a bridge shooting someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.250" offset="11145338">On the other hand, Mr. Miller's story was not implausible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.124" offset="11160803">He stated that they came to his residence after they killed Gorsuch, and there was really no reason to disbelieve him, except for the state's suggestion that if he were innocent and if his story were true, he would have told that story when he was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.789" offset="11235408">In addition, as the opinions of the lower courts indicate, Williams testimony was impeached in substantial respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.207" offset="11273129">For instance, he stated in a post arrest statement that while they were riding around, prior to... actually he stated in a post arrest statement that after they picked up... that Armstrong had fired a revolver into the backseat of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.871" offset="11351810">In the post arrest statement, he said that this had occurred after they had picked up Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.617" offset="11386710">But if that was true, according to Gorsuch, the gun would either hit Miller or it would hit the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.255" offset="11413355">He changed his testimony at trial to say the revolver was fired before they picked up the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.002" offset="11444283">Williams' testimony was also contradicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.267" offset="11457345">He testified that the evidence indicated that the victim might not have been shot at the bridge; that he might have been killed by a pair of nunchakus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.465" offset="11502171">There were nunchakus hanging on the wall at Williams' residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.636" offset="11518785">And although he denied using them to beat the victim, the evidence established that the cause of death... or indicated that the cause of death could have resulted from a blow to the head from those nunchakus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.896" offset="11575836">For these reasons, even if the state's standard is accepted, I would urge this Court to affirm the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2873.140" offset="11636858">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.187" offset="11649083">Your Honors, if I might say with all due respect, I doubt seriously if the Court is interested in determining whether or not the verdict in this particular case is one that any of the nine members of this Court would have voted for if they had been jurors in this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.103" offset="11704672">I think that it's sufficient for me to say here that there are significant problems with a determination that Randy Williams' credibility was not good enough to support this conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.737" offset="11759216">Under the circumstances of this case, for Randy Williams to implicate Chuck Miller in this murder would have been suicidal if in fact Chuck Miller were innocent, because all that Randy Williams could hope to do by that is create an enemy to whom he had recently confessed that he was a murderer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.871" offset="11831732">So I think without belaboring the point to the Court, a fair analysis of the facts suggests that this is what Judge Easterbrook called it, a close case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.758" offset="11867363">I'm not going to dispute the respondent's assertion that this is a credibility contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.054" offset="11884499">Many criminal trials are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.757" offset="11891291">But I doubt very seriously that the Court wants to look at this case for its credibility aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.645" offset="11910830">Your Honors, I think that one point that might help understanding the petitioner's position is that there is a difference in law between unfairness and fundamental unfairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.923" offset="11959941">It was unfair for this prosecutor to get up and say what he said before that objection was sustained, just like it was unfair for the prosecutor in Darden to call the defendant an animal; just like it would be unfair for a prosecutor to have exculpatory material in his file and not turn it over; just like any number of instances involving unfairness by the prosecutor which are assessed under a due process model to see if prejudice resulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.614" offset="12062759">Fundamental unfairness is a constitutionally significant term, and it does not apply to the circumstances present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.455" offset="12098076">And I think to the extent that fundamental unfairness was found in Doyle v. Ohio, much of the problem that lower courts have had is in mixing or confusing unfairness with fundamental unfairness.</text>

            <text syncTime="3014.195" offset="12201103">Doyle is a case which has had a tremendous impact on the trial courts in the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.678" offset="12218971">But for one of those types of constitutional criminal procedure cases, it hasn't received extensive treatment on its facts from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.020" offset="12252408">There's Doyle, and in essence, the only other case that's directly in the same realm as Doyle is Wainwright.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.906" offset="12279888">But I want the Court to be very cautious, because Wainwright is a case involving substantive use of post warning silence, a situation which creates unfairness potential that is significantly different from what is seen here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.074" offset="12332551">Finally, to the extent that the respondent describes our standard as being one that is virtually impossible and unworkable for that reason, that must be distressing news to this Court, because we got that standard from this Court's majority opinion in Strickland v. Washington; we incorporated it wholesale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.365" offset="12397753">So to the extent that it's attacked for not being feasible or realistic, we would assert to the Court that the circumstances of Sixth Amendment litigation in this country don't bear that claim out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.237" offset="12441221">For all of the reasons advanced by the petitioners this afternoon, we urge that the Court reverse the decision of the en banc Seventh Circuit ordering a new trial for this respondent.</text>
