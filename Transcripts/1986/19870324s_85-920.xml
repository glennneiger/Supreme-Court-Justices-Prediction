            <text syncTime="9.106" offset="128141">Well in this case the petitioners are 14 of the major air carriers of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.504" offset="157712">The case comes to us from the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.289" offset="172863">And it concerned the so-called Employee Protection Program in Section 43 of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.553" offset="221973">And this imposed on the air carriers a duty to hire qualified airline personnel who are dislocated as a result of the deregulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.049" offset="275890">Section 43 authorize the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.227" offset="296683">But that section also contained a legislating-veto provision and it is that provision which is the focus of this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.781" offset="334822">The airlines filed suit and the District Court gathered summary judgment in their favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.862" offset="359168">Holding that the legislative-veto provision was unconstitutional under the Chadha case decided here not too long ago, and striking down the entire Employee Protection Program on the ground that the veto provision was not severable from the remainder of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.764" offset="438790">On appeal the Court of Appeals reversed that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.775" offset="458852">The case came here, and in an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and hold that Section 43's legislative-veto provision is indeed severable from the remainder of the Employee Protection Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.952" offset="535547">The Court is unanimous in this ruling.</text>
