            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="91783">The last case Brock versus Roadway Express Incorporated is in appeal from the judgment of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.319" offset="149043">Which court held unconstitutional Section 405 of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.755" offset="182794">We hold today that the Act does not deprive the employer of due process by failing to require the full evidentiary hearing before the temporary reinstatement is ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.161" offset="232426">So long as the employee is given an opportunity to respond to the Secretary's evidence and the prompt postreinstatement hearing is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.642" offset="282268">We therefore affirm in part and reverse in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.869" offset="299195">Justice Blackmun, Justice Powell and Justice O'Connor have joined this opinion; Justice Brennan has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part; Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which the Chief Justice and Justice Scalia join; Justice Steven has filed an opinion dissenting in part.</text>
