            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="129276">We will hear arguments next in No. 85-2099, Pennsylvania against Finley.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.616" offset="159683">Mrs. Barthold, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="gaele_m_barthold" startTime="63.392" stopTime="228.620">
            <label>Ms. Gaele M. Barthold</label>
            <text syncTime="63.392" offset="382768">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="66.975" offset="397083">Twenty years ago this Court imposed strict and unique briefing requirements on appointed attorneys seeking to withdraw because they concluded that a client's first appeal was frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.873" offset="444731">In addition, reviewing courts, charged with hearing such appeals, were charged with the responsibility of conducting an independent review of the record to determine whether the appeal was in fact frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.131" offset="497707">This issue presented by this case is whether those procedures, those prophylactic rules as articulated by this Court in Anders v. California, should be held applicable on collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.620" offset="551728">It is our position that they should not be held applicable, and that in the collateral review context, a no merit letter, with notice to the client and an opportunity to proceed pro se, is a constitutionally acceptable alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.861" offset="612646">Now before detailing our reasons in support of that conclusion, I would like rather briefly to address the respondent's claim that this Court is without jurisdiction to decide that issue because the opinion below rests on an adequate and independent state basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.680" offset="675967">The opinion is, of course, a Pennsylvania Superior Court opinion; although that is an intermediate appellate court, it is the highest court in which the decision could be had in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.746" offset="720166">The respondent is a state prisoner having been convicted in 1975 of second degree felony murder and related offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.492" offset="755170">She was represented by appointed counsel during his trial, and during her unsuccessful direct appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.130" offset="789756">She next sought collateral review under the State Post Conviction Hearing Act statute, and counsel was not appointed for her because the claims that she raised were finally litigated under Pennsylvania law.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.238" offset="842210">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, however, held that under its supervisory rules, its rules of criminal procedure, that any defendant is entitled to counsel on a first PCHA petition, or on a subsequent petition raising new issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.749" offset="908247">When counsel was appointed for Mrs. Finley, he reviewed the record and concluded that he had no arguable issues to raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.194" offset="945968">He, as a result, after consulting with his client, filed a no merit letter with the Post Conviction Hearing Act court, and detailed in that letter the additional claims which Mrs. Finley wanted raised on her behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.814" offset="1000512">Based on that letter and his own independent review of the record, the Post Conviction Hearing Act judge dismissed the petition and allowed counsel to withdraw.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="228.620" offset="1043666">Have you any knowledge as to exactly what his review of the record consisted of?</text>
            <text syncTime="233.665" offset="1063833">Was he looking at the notes of testimony or what?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gaele_m_barthold" startTime="236.286" stopTime="239.969">
            <label>Ms. Gaele M. Barthold</label>
            <text syncTime="236.286" offset="1074386">We know from his letter that he looked at the notes of testimony.</text>

          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="239.969" stopTime="241.229">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="239.969" offset="1089119">Is that enough?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gaele_m_barthold" startTime="241.229" stopTime="510.405">
            <label>Ms. Gaele M. Barthold</label>
            <text syncTime="241.229" offset="1094135">Judge Blake indicated in his opinion that he looked at the entire record.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.462" offset="1115033">We also know that he consulted with his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.466" offset="1127049">So I think we are reasonably certain that he did the kind of conscientious review that he should have done, and which this Court, of course, in Strickland, has said that counsel is presumed to do their job and to be competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.343" offset="1186608">Now when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court reversed because Anders' prophylactic requirements on direct appeal had not been complied with, they said, among other things, since Anders has been applied in similar circumstances, we hold, quote unquote, Anders is applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.426" offset="1258915">And in addition, they noted that the Pennsylvania law with respect to the withdrawal of counsel is derived from... and those were their exact words... Anders v. California.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.154" offset="1301860">I think those two statements by the Superior Court make it very clear that there is not an independent state basis for this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.267" offset="1330282">That conclusion is underscored by the fact that there is no clear statement in the opinion saying we used the Federal authority only for purposes of guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.395" offset="1370824">And of course in this Court's opinion, Michigan v. Long, you made clear to state courts that if they wanted to make such a statement, they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.340" offset="1402589">So I think there's no question but that this Court has jurisdiction to consider the very significant issue which is presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.086" offset="1433518">Now, I think the starting point for that consideration is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.527" offset="1447310">First, it must be recalled that collateral review is in fact a procedure which is three, if not four, steps removed from the trial court process.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.305" offset="1490465">By that point in the proceedings, a defendant has had the opportunity to raise matters in post trial motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.867" offset="1516692">A defendant has had a direct first appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.340" offset="1530589">A defendant, in a majority of jurisdictions, has had the opportunity to either have or to seek discretionary review.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.506" offset="1559219">Collateral review is three or four steps removed, and it's a procedure which is intended to identify those rare cases in which there is error that has not been previously identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.904" offset="1616793">Secondly, it is of course very important that there is no general constitutional right to counsel on collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.899" offset="1648871">Nonetheless, the respondent claims that since counsel was given, although only under a supervisory rule, not under a constitutional basis, and so far as we can determine, there is no state in the country that gives counsel on collateral review based on a state constitutional basis, the respondent contends that since the right to counsel is there, all of the procedures that are given with respect to the right to counsel on a first appeal should be given; in other words, that Anders should be applied even though we are only talking about a supervisory right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.883" offset="1800799">And I think respondent has really three misconceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.436" offset="1815010">First, respondent assumes that an Anders brief is in fact an advocate's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.320" offset="1838520">And of course, an Anders brief is not that.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.112" offset="1849700">What it is is a device to determine, to monitor, whether counsel has in fact conducted the sort of conscientious and thorough review of the case to be certain that the appeal is in fact... or the petition is in fact... frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.863" offset="1912708">I think counsel does not take account of the fact that when you get to collateral review, you are getting to a procedure that is so far removed that there simply are cases without arguable issues by the time you get to collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.124" offset="1981671">And I think finally the respondent assumes that Anders is the only way of being sure that attorneys do their job.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.230" offset="2018138">And I think that is just not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.931" offset="2024930">Attorneys do their job.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.954" offset="2033080">Attorneys are presumed to be competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.385" offset="2042798">Attorneys have an obligation not to clog the courts with frivolous arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.187" offset="2062024">And I think that you need not apply the precise procedures of Anders on collateral review to see that counsel do what they're charged to do, which is to do their job.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.524" offset="2107372">Now, the important considerations are: fundamental fairness; meaningful access; and the fact that there are not the invidious discrimination, the fact that arbitrary obstacles not be put in a defendant's way so that--</text>

            <text syncTime="615.893" offset="2592832">There has been no evidence to rebut the fact that it was received.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.139" offset="2613730">The respondent speaks in terms of, quote unquote, apparent lack of notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.201" offset="2634001">But that notice has not been rebutted, and there are, I think, a number of arguments to be made, which perhaps I'll reserve, which would demonstrate that even if you want to assume for the sake of argument that the notice was not received, that there was no prejudice to this particular defendant because of the peculiarities of both this case and of Pennsylvania practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.606" offset="2719683">So if you take the fundamental fairness, the meaningful access, and the no invidious discrimination concepts, and I think apply the balancing test which this Court has articulated in Matthews v. Eldridge, and then applied in Ake v. Oklahoma, what we should look at is the individual interest, which is, here, the accuracy of the criminal proceeding itself; the governmental interest, which would be the cost to the criminal justice system of applying Anders; and finally, what value is to be derived from applying the procedure here sought, Anders, whether it is more likely than not that cases would be identified that would otherwise be lost in the shuffle, so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.715" offset="2904107">And I would submit that when you apply that balancing test, the line should be drawn to say that Anders is not applicable on collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.092" offset="2949560">The chances of it resulting in the identification of cases on collateral review that truly have even arguable issues, I think, is just not likely.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.200" offset="2998043">I think that the Court should look at the strains on the criminal justice system, if you conclude that Anders should be applied on collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.605" offset="3031689">Because we are talking about post conviction hearing remedies and petitions which are burgeoning out of all proportions, at least in the states, and I would assume in the federal system too.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.113" offset="3073694">We are talking about a complete change in the role of the courts, who are not sitting as courts, but are required to conduct this independent review of records, which puts a great strain on one of our scarcest resources at this time, which is the time of our judges.</text>

            <text syncTime="972.678" offset="4019954">And I would submit, Mr. Chief Justice, that it would be unfortunate if that should happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.503" offset="4047225">Because these states have determined, for either... for one reason or another to give indigents counsel when it's not necessary for them to do so constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.460" offset="4091111">And I think we should encourage that, but not superimpose other procedures which will make that burdensome on the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.137" offset="4121727">Now turning to this defendant's, this respondent's case, she undoubtedly will argue to you that there was no notice, therefore, she must necessarily win the case; and secondly, that her appointed PCHA attorney was ineffective because he did not raise certain arguably meritorious issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.850" offset="4212633">We have addressed both of those in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.272" offset="4226321">With respect to the so-called issues, I have dealt with them in a footnote, and I truly believe that they are in fact frivolous issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.969" offset="4265087">With respect to the notice matter, even if we want to assume for the sake of argument that Dorothy Finley did not receive the no merit letter... and as I indicated, it shows a carbon copy to her... she still had the benefit, in this particular case, of having the time consuming independent review of the record, which was conducted by the Post Conviction Hearing Act judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.864" offset="4364665">And he concluded, independently, that there was nothing there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.288" offset="4378354">And finally, under the peculiarities of Pennsylvania practice, she is not barred from filing yet another Post Conviction Hearing Act petition, and raising whatever issues she would want to.</text>

            <text syncTime="1095.440" offset="4510951">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.115" offset="4537700">First, let me address Ms. Barthold... some of the issues that she had raised, before getting into my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.387" offset="4558807">In response to Justice O'Connor's question, in this case my client told me that she never received that letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.882" offset="4584721">Since we didn't get the hearing that the Superior Court had awarded to us, that's a question of evidence that is still open.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.305" offset="4610425">I would argue that she didn't receive the notice that was required under Anders in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.049" offset="4629443">Secondly, the district attorney repeatedly characterized collateral review as three or four steps removed from the actual trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.754" offset="4660267">That's not exactly accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.624" offset="4667686">In Pennsylvania, as I would imagine in most jurisdictions, the only issues which can be raised in the higher courts are those which were raised in post trial motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.400" offset="4706869">Therefore, we're actually one step removed, if you consider that there was... if there was an issue that was not raised in post trial motions, neither the Superior Court nor the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had that issue before it when they were deciding the direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.400" offset="4762876">Thirdly, I'd like to note that the district attorney points to this case as a case of fundamental fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.904" offset="4788789">I agree with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1496.965" offset="6117064">For that reason, even petitioners who raise... who draft their own petitions and name things that have already been litigated on a first PCHA are entitled to counsel, the reasoning being not only that they're entitled to an advocate, but also because an attorney can better explore the issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="1537.640" offset="6279754">So I think that that would contemplate that there might be a constitutional issue raised if counsel were very ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.103" offset="6305668">It's not necessary to get to that, though, because Pennsylvania's own collateral review procedure provides for ineffective assistance of counsel questions to be raised right in our Commonwealth courts, and to be taken care of there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.672" offset="6351957">For that reason I'd also take issue with the idea that applying Anders in collateral review cases would clog the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.044" offset="6377452">I think, on the contrary, applying Anders in these cases would make sure that the court more readily reached the merits of the case, and if it is frivolous, got rid of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.551" offset="6415382">Rather than... of have a no merit letter, which I think would encourage the petitioner to go to the federal courts with a habeas petition saying that they weren't dealt with fairly.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.294" offset="6610360">So the Pennsylvania courts are familiar with it; had 20 years practice with it; and the opinion indicates that Pennsylvania law is derived from Anders, but it doesn't say it's constitutionally compelled by it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1786.463" offset="7275124">And Evitts v. Lucey is very close to this case, and rests on due process grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.410" offset="7298843">Although of course I'm also arguing equal protection, because I have an indigent who is, with a court appointed attorney, forced to take whatever the state gives her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.705" offset="7332071">Pennsylvania law gives no right to the indigent to complain about which attorney she gets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.218" offset="7354118">And the indigent has to take whichever attorney it is and can't request them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.119" offset="7369687">I think for equal protection reasons, it would probably be reasonable for the Court to more closely scrutinize court appointed counsel's conduct in this regard, and to make sure that the poor defendant, petitioner, gets the same justice that the wealthier one can afford to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.802" offset="7452443">So my argument rests both on due process and on equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.616" offset="7471669">The no merit letter, by contrast, does violence to both due process and equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.781" offset="7504375">The district attorney has suggested that there may be other ways to deal with this problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1854.330" offset="7546589">The no merit letter is not the way to deal with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.412" offset="7558918">This Court specifically disapproved of the no merit letter in the Anders case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.396" offset="7574801">I see no reason to distinguish between direct appeal and collateral review when talking about the sufficiency of the no merit letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.548" offset="7603431">It has the terrible handicap that it forces the court appointed counsel to argue against his own client, and it puts the petitioner in the position of having the state give her a lawyer who thereafter briefs the case for the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.609" offset="7663617">I think the no merit letter is affirmatively bad in that respect, and is not a substitute for Anders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.753" offset="7688277">It may be that there's another state in the union that has come up with a better way to deal with this problem, but the district attorney hasn't suggested one, and the no merit letter is not that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2185.258" offset="8870265">And also, because the court wants to ensure that the indigent prisoners get the same equal protection and due process as wealthier individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.934" offset="8916972">I'd also ask the Court to consider that the alternative in this case... and what we are really talking about here is a procedure, the no merit letter... is not sufficient under due process or equal protection guidelines for the reasons ably stated in Anders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.213" offset="8974128">And in the alternative, I'd argue that this decision of the Superior Court rests on adequate and independent state grounds, and that this Court can decline to accept jurisdiction and let the Pennsylvania's court choice to deal with this difficult problem stand.</text>
