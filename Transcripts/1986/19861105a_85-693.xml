            <label>Mr. Graydon S. Staring</label>
            <text syncTime="47.481" offset="335592">I'm not sure how they got there.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.731" offset="344578">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="53.385" offset="359207">Narrowly viewed, this case arises from a dispute over a supply contract between two foreigners abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.792" offset="408839">A different and broader view was taken of the case by the Respondent and by the California Supreme Court, as a case affecting the potential tort and indemnity claims of Californians.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.368" offset="471115">Even if this Court were to decide the case upon the narrowest of grounds, we think it could not very well ignore the implications which the case might have for the tort suits of injured parties in America.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.532" offset="551781">I therefore do not address the case with the intent to neglect that broader issue, but instead would propose to address it on that issue, rather than the narrower one.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.208" offset="614475">Both parties here start with World-Wide Volkswagen.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.981" offset="641643">That case, as you well know, is an interstate case rather than a case involving an international relationship or a foreign defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.955" offset="697545">I think that members of this Court have not been completely at ease with the emphasis upon the concept and term "sovereignty" in the analysis of the problem in World-Wide Volkswagen.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.785" offset="780823">That analysis can probably be validly taken as a reverse view of the individual rights which are intended to be preserved by the due process clause, and indeed I have seen that view taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.597" offset="852085">Here in this case, however, by contrast with World-Wide Volkswagen, we have an attempted projection of state power internationally.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.923" offset="909345">We have, I think, therefore an authentic case for analysis in the traditional terms of sovereignty, as we are dealing not only with an express clause of the Constitution, albeit a terse one, but with the problem of considering standards of international law and comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.609" offset="1024075">Perhaps the conclusion that we urge here could be reached on the basis of such international standards and without reference to the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.266" offset="1074753">We don't urge that.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.868" offset="1081127">We see no need to, and we don't think it's desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.420" offset="1099412">Questions which arise domestically and questions of personal jurisdiction which arise internationally should, if possible, be resolved with similar analyses.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.949" offset="1165450">These analyses in our view would be inconsistent only in respect of the element of this Court's power to control reception and enforcement within the United States and this Court's function of distributing to some extent the judicial business within an interstate federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.933" offset="1273388">And of course, therefore, in the international case it would be necessary, we think, to take account of the lack of that power and the lack of that function in the international sphere, and in that sphere to give some heed to the views of others abroad in connection with our international powers.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.445" offset="1559481">We are not suggesting, by the way, that this Court in this case should announce a rule of international law or a standard of international conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.193" offset="1634505">That would be uncalled for.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.645" offset="1648297">It is, I suppose, a proposal of that nature which the Respondent suggests in urging the affirmance below at one point in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.987" offset="1705662">What we do say is that international considerations call for a heightened scrutiny of the necessary contacts, ties, or relations to establish personal jurisdiction, and we do urge that a case of this character is not one in which the scope of the jurisdiction of our state courts over manufacturers abroad should be extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.231" offset="1870652">We would not even urge that there should be such an extension if our client were a domestic manufacturer of components, but that is not the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.503" offset="1915687">It is a foreign, an alien manufacturer, and we think this is not... such a case is not a case for an extension such as the Supreme Court of California has given to World-Wide Volkswagen.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>

            <label>Mr. Graydon S. Staring</label>
            <text syncTime="483.880" offset="2081198">But had it done so, we would be making the same argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.603" offset="2108052">As I said at the outset, I did not wish to take refuge solely in the narrow view, in the narrow issue in this case raised by the fact that it pertains to a contract between two parties in the Far East.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.863" offset="2169179">I do not waive that issue, but I think the broader issue has to be seen by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.248" offset="2186629">The focus of attention under World-Wide Volkswagen in this case has been on the stream of commerce doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.222" offset="2234590">We don't know where the headwaters of that stream are and we have no map to show us.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.495" offset="2263638">But we assume for our purposes here that Asahi delivered products into that stream or some tributary of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.999" offset="2297701">We don't accept, however, the Respondent's further suggestion, that a component maker in the position of Asahi here is somehow or other especially responsible for that stream, as though it were the original spring.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.860" offset="2369172">That is an unrealistic view, we suggest, both commercially and legally.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.482" offset="2399579">This Court in referring to the significance of delivering products into the stream of commerce in World-Wide Volkswagen added, however, the important qualification that they must be so delivered with the expectation that they would be sold to consumers in the forum state.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.867" offset="2501143">The Court went on to say that foreseeability or mere foreseeability of their reaching the forum state was not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.341" offset="2547014">The Supreme Court of California chose to deal with the case not in terms of foreseeability, the term "foreseeability" which this Court had used, but rather in terms of awareness, and there has been some argument in the briefs about the difference between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.053" offset="2625904">I would not bandy words here about foreseeability and awareness, but would suggest instead that at this point we look at the evidence, the very brief, the very simple evidence in the record, which was found sufficient below to sustain jurisdiction in California, because it illustrates a problem which is inherent in cases which will arise under the standard which the California Supreme Court has adopted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2605.839" offset="10569009">But in terms of fair play and substantial justice, I think in balancing the interest of the state versus balancing the interest of Asahi weighs favorably in that of the state, because again I come back to the same notion, that Asahi regularly over the course of ten years and over the course of five years sold well over one and a quarter million valves to Cheng Shin with knowledge of its distribution system, made money off of Californians, subjected Californians to the potential of harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.964" offset="10713518">It's the legal system in California that allows Asahi to do the business that it does there indirectly, and I don't see why Asahi can't come to California and defend its case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2759.772" offset="11184767">But it's the best of my knowledge there is another action out there waiting for the determination of this Court, because they didn't want to go through the same appellate process that we were going through.</text>
