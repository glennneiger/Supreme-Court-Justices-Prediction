            <text syncTime="9.291" offset="128874">Well this is an income tax case and the issue is whether the taxpayer who devotes his full time to making wagers, gambling or the support of himself in his family, is engaged in a trade or business, as those terms are used in certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.237" offset="232632">If he is engaged in the trade or business certain tax consequences follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.706" offset="250604">If he is not so engaged certain other consequences follow more adverse to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.258" offset="276727">The Courts of Appeal have reached different conclusions on this issue and hence we took it to resolve the conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.140" offset="304312">In an opinion filed today, we hold that such a taxpayer who is so engaged is in a trade of business, and hence affirm the judgment of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals which had ruled to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.797" offset="394905">Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion and is joined therein by the the Chief Justice and by Justice Scalia.</text>
