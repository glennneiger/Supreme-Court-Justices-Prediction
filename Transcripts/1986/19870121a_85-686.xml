            <label>Mr. David M. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="65.275" offset="403733">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="69.577" offset="420973">The issue presented by this case is whether a claim filed in state court for disability benefits under an ERISA-covered welfare plan is a claim rising under federal law by either federal preemption or falls within the original jurisdiction of the district court by reason of an express grant of jurisdiction in the federal statute so that it may properly be removed to the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.128" offset="531210">General Motors Corporation provides disability benefits to its employees under the General Motors Insurance Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.067" offset="562975">General Motors Corporation is the plan administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.269" offset="575723">The named fiduciary is the finance committee of the General Motors Board of Directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.006" offset="598710">Disabled employees can receive sickness and accident benefits providing 75 percent of normal compensation for up to 52 weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.231" offset="643641">The benefit is provided through Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.116" offset="659106">In addition, General Motors provides an additional benefit called salary continuation benefit, equal to 25 percent of normal compensation for up to 26 weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.693" offset="713440">The salary continuation benefit is provided solely by General Motors, is not insured and is self-funded.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.798" offset="745832">Mr. Taylor commenced a sick leave of absence in 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.833" offset="765999">During his sick leave and through July of 1980 he received both sickness and accident benefits and salary continuation benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.308" offset="807899">Benefits ceased upon a determination that Mr. Taylor was no longer disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.462" offset="832559">Mr. Taylor was advised to report to the General Motors medical department and there advised that he was capable of returning to employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.584" offset="869026">His continued absence from employment caused his termination of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.637" offset="889192">Thereafter he filed a lawsuit against both General Motors and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company seeking the immediate re-implementation of all benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.195" offset="939452">The complaint referred specifically to sickness and accident benefits provided by Metropolitan and salary continuation benefits provided by General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.670" offset="981352">In addition, the plaintiff sought extra contractual damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.788" offset="997861">The action was removed by General Motors Corporation to the federal district court based on a claim that the claim arose within the original jurisdiction of the federal court and that any claim for benefits had to arise under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.982" offset="1062645">In 1981, the District Court considered a motion to remand filed by the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.487" offset="1096604">The plaintiff at that time conceded that he sought disability salary continuation benefits directly from General Motors and his motion to remand was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.961" offset="1138505">Thereafter a summary judgment was granted in favor of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.847" offset="1154074">The Sixth Circuit, upon consideration of the case, found no federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.483" offset="1180614">They found that based on three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.805" offset="1193884">They refused, despite the statutory and legislative history, they refused to consider the claims under ERISA were to be treated in similar fashion as arising under the laws of the United States as those under the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.147" offset="1263266">They further felt that the plaintiff had limited his complaint to state law principles and thus the well-pleaded complaint rule precluded removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.705" offset="1305479">And lastly, they interpreted General Motors' reference to ERISA as raising only a defense under federal law and thus interpreted the Franchise Tax Board decision of this Court as precluding removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.048" offset="1366815">Because Taylor's suit necessarily arises under federal law and because it's within the original jurisdiction of the federal court, it is properly removable.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.605" offset="1413104">The Federal Removal Statute applies to claims within the jurisdiction, within the original jurisdiction of the federal court and also to claims arising under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.247" offset="1455631">ERISA, at Section 502, authorizes a participant to commence a civil action to recover benefits due him under the plan, to enforce his rights under the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.023" offset="1522714">ERISA at 502(e) and (f) specifically provide that such claims seeking benefit entitlement are within the original jurisdiction of the federal courts regardless of citizenship of the parties, and regardless of the amount in controversy.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="362.718" stopTime="375.478">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="362.718" offset="1593558">I think all of that is probably conceded, Mr. Davis, and what the fight here about is the conflict between the well-pleaded complaint doctrine and the rules that you're talking about.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_m_davis" startTime="375.478" stopTime="398.457">
            <label>Mr. David M. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="375.478" offset="1644549">Okay, I think it's important to recognize that under 502 Congress, in the legislative history, specifically advised that claims seeking benefit entitlement were to be considered arising under the laws of the federal, of the United States in similar fashion to Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.522" offset="1724797">And that reference is extremely important.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="398.457" stopTime="407.449">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="398.457" offset="1736500">What the plaintiff has said here, as I understand it, is, yes, I'm pleading this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.961" offset="1758547">Perhaps I could have brought it under federal law, but I'm bringing it under state law.</text>

          <turn speaker="david_m_davis" startTime="407.449" stopTime="489.114">
            <label>Mr. David M. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="407.449" offset="1772444">Okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.649" offset="1777251">And that's why the reference to 301 is extremely important.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.317" offset="1787909">This Court has indicated that a claim based on a collectively-bargained agreement under Section 301, although the plaintiff attempts to rely on state law remedies, or state law breach of contract principles, that claim necessarily arises under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.927" offset="1854364">In Avco, this Court indicated that 301 actions, and Congress intended ERISA to be treated the same, are controlled by federal substantive law that arise under the United States, laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.669" offset="1913297">In Franchise Tax Board again, this Court considered that premise and indicated that Avco stood for the proposition that if a federal cause of action completely preempts a state cause of action any complaint coming within the scope of the federal action, although attempting to rely on state law, necessarily arises under the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.932" offset="2006397">Indeed, in the Franchise Tax Board decision, this Court commented on the specific remedies under Section 502 of ERISA and indicated that it may well be if a complaint attempting to rely on state law comes within the bounds of Section 502 and the remedies enumerated therein, then the case necessarily arises under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.381" offset="2096154">And--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="489.114" stopTime="502.124">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="489.114" offset="2099079">We're those cases that say that the so-called 301 actions aren't... don't completely preempt the state causes of action.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_m_davis" startTime="502.124" stopTime="510.444">
            <label>Mr. David M. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="502.124" offset="2151115">--And probably the issue in those cases are whether the action is peripheral, far enough apart, tangential to the labor agreement.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="510.444" stopTime="517.217">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="510.444" offset="2184448">Whatever way you put it, the argument is that state law is not put aside.</text>

            <label>Mr. David M. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="517.217" offset="2211510">One difference between the Labor Management Relations Act is that statute didn't include a comprehensive remedial scheme such as ERISA, so the courts have fashioned federal remedies under section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.941" offset="2266472">It didn't have express remedies in the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.393" offset="2280265">And it didn't have express federal preemption in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.713" offset="2293535">ERISA has both of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.697" offset="2301476">It has a private member in the statute--</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="541.499" offset="2308686">So, you say that preemption is much more stricter and more obvious here than in the 301 cases?</text>

          <turn speaker="david_m_davis" startTime="547.903" stopTime="609.559">
            <label>Mr. David M. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="547.903" offset="2334286">--That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.569" offset="2336898">That would be my position.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.438" offset="2340451">It's clear that Congress, in enacting ERISA remedies in Section 502, and claims procedures in Section 503, intended that those provisions be exclusive and preempt state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.214" offset="2407533">This can be demonstrated by the statutory language of ERISA as well as the legislative history under ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.220" offset="2439507">Congress recognized that federal governance of a growing body of employee benefit plans that implicated as participants the vast majority of citizens of this country, they declared the policy to be to protect participants by establishing standards of conduct, responsibility and obligations for fiduciaries of employee benefit plans, and by providing appropriate remedies, sanctions and ready access to the federal courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="663.758" offset="2797698">That was a 5-4 split, the majority rejecting removal because of the absence of a federal remedy in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="806.314" offset="3367899">I think it doesn't apply when the law is such that the state claims have been preempted and been replaced by federal remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.237" offset="3399664">I think this Court recognized that in Franchise Tax Court and in Avco, and the same situation exists here.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.406" offset="3424324">When that happens, the well-pleaded complaint rule doesn't preclude the Court from looking behind the complaint to determine the true character of the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.948" offset="3466433">In this case, it's a federal cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.900" offset="3478240">I think also that is very clear from the legislative history under ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.637" offset="3505199">In reviewing the legislative history it's apparent Senator Harrison Williams stressed that the substantive and enforcement provisions of ERISA are intended to preempt the field for federal regulation, thus eliminating the threat of conflicting and inconsistent state and local regulation of employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.252" offset="3595687">Congressman John Dent made note of what to many is the crowning achievement of the legislation, the reservations of federal authority of the sole power to regulate the field of employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.560" offset="3648872">Again, the Conference Committee referred to actions for claims under Section 502 as arising in federal or state courts, or to regarded as arising under the laws of the United States in similar fashion to labor laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.022" offset="3714805">Senator Javits, one of the two principal Senate sponsors, in presenting the Conference Committee report indicated that it was also intended that a federal substantive law be developed by the courts to deal with issues involving rights and obligations under private welfare and pension plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.852" offset="3802054">Allowing the plaintiff to pursue state remedies would undercut these congressional goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.856" offset="3830057">These goals were recognized by this Court in Alessi v. Raybestos-Manhattan and Shaw v. Delta Airlines where state statutes were held preempted and the benefit plan regulation was declared to be an area of exclusively federal concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.252" offset="3907693">This Court noted that Congress minimized the need for interstate employers to administer their plans differently in each state in which they have employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.477" offset="3948549">And participants, if state remedies survive, will be able to avoid the carefully designed claims procedures mandated by ERISA for all plans, both insured and self-insured.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.701" offset="4005496">This Court, in Allis Chalmers v. Lueck, held that a state tort claim for breach of the duty of good faith was preempted by federal labor law.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.843" offset="4046038">Importantly, this Court noted that the most harmful aspect of the Wisconsin decision rejecting preemption was that it would allow essentially the same suit to be brought in state court without first exhausting the grievance procedures established in the bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.554" offset="4120853">That same undesirable result would be here as well if the plaintiffs were allowed to avoid these federal remedies and federal claims procedures and proceed directly to state court under state claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.730" offset="4181561">Additionally, exhausting of the state remedies of the claims procedures and the remedies in ERISA would have the tendency of providing the participant with a reasoned knowledge of why his claim was denied and would have a tendency to reduce litigation rather than encourage it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.608" offset="4253137">The claims procedures and remedies set forth in ERISA would be rendered ineffectual for the vast majority of plans if plaintiffs were allowed to pursue state remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.285" offset="4303814">As the Solicitor General noted... and, Justice O'Connor, the figures you cited were correct... I would say about 90 percent of the welfare plans are insured and administered by insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.443" offset="4356477">Allowing different remedies for insured versus self-insured plans would act to lessen the protection for participants because employers would tend to move toward self-insured plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.685" offset="4413424">Not surprising that the United States in its amicus brief filed in Pilot Life, the case preceding, noted that Congress intends the remedies provided under Section 502 to be exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.945" offset="4474446">The government recognized that Congress had established a detailed enforcement scheme, that Congress made clear that federal law applies and that federal common law was to be developed, that Congress declared that all actions arise in similar fashion as those under the Labor law, and, further, that the legislative history under 502 failed to mention, or even contemplate, that participants could pursue alternative state remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.464" offset="4588549">The government felt that was important because had such been the intent it surely would have been mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.885" offset="4614253">Congress enacted Section 514 as an express preemption of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.891" offset="4646227">No doubt Section 514 supersedes any and all state laws that may relate to an employee benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.413" offset="4684366">And further, Section 514 provided for an insurance savings clause preserving the state's ability to regulate the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.102" offset="4719057">Nevertheless, the deemer clause limited the exception so that state laws would not be applied directly to the plans, not be applied directly in areas where ERISA comprehensively regulated the plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.028" offset="4782795">The Metropolitan v. Massachusetts case is not to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.766" offset="4801708">In that particular case a Massachusetts-mandated benefit law survived preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.670" offset="4825323">That was an area under ERISA that was not regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.372" offset="4840160">ERISA does not regulate the content of a welfare benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.990" offset="4858655">That was a... that was a result that did not provide direct regulation of the plan; it only provided regulation of an insurance company in the type of policy they could sell to a plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.547" offset="4904839">In this case, ERISA comprehensively regulates remedies available to participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.237" offset="4931589">ERISA comprehensively, if state remedies survive that would be state law acting directly on the plan, not on any insurance company, directly on the plan and its claims processing procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.497" offset="4992611">That result was far different than that in the Metropolitan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.615" offset="5009120">Lastly, Taylor's complaint contains a claim for an uninsured or self-insured benefit, that being the salary continuation benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.005" offset="5058648">That's a benefit that's not governed at all, no relevance to the insurance savings clause under Section 514, clearly a benefit that's self-insured and self-funded, independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.813" offset="5105878">That claim alone would support removal and along with the removal of that claim would come the rest of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.900" offset="5138270">In summary, allowing participants to pursue state remedies in seeking entitlement to benefits under ERISA would be contrary to Congressional intent to have benefit plan regulation to be a matter of exclusive federal concern, to encourage the continued growth of such plans by protecting plans and plan administrators from inconsistent and varying state regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2378.839" offset="9657976">But the real, what is really at issue here is that under Section 502 a claim for benefits is subject to the highly deferential, arbitrary and capricious standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.484" offset="9724640">That is a standard review in federal court in a 502 action by a claimant for benefits, including a claim for breach of the insurance policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2416.047" offset="9806874">They want full benefit of that deferential, arbitrary and capricious standard in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.320" offset="9839997">But Congress had good reason not to make that Section 502 remedy and the deferential standard that goes with it exclusively applicable precluding state remedies in cases against insurance companies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2442.865" offset="9914080">It may be one thing for Congress to make 502 remedies exclusively for suing a neutral trustee, or a neutral plan administrator, but when you're suing an insurance company, the insurance company is a contracting party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.874" offset="9970191">If you're suing an insurance company for breach of contract does it make any sense to defer to one party of a two party contract and its interpretation of the contract language?</text>

            <text syncTime="3321.431" offset="13428386">Briefly, if we talk or focus on the obviousness test, in the Avco case the issue was whether a state injunctive remedy was preempted by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.274" offset="13483765">That was not clear and obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.857" offset="13490139">There was a split in the Circuits on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.523" offset="13500797">This Court granted jurisdiction, or took the case to resolve the conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.761" offset="13521695">An obviousness test would preclude the development of any uniformity development of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.581" offset="13544996">Under ERISA it is important that it was intended by Congress that the body of the uniform law be developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.686" offset="13573417">Any obviousness test precluding removal would retard that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.722" offset="13589509">Further, this Court has recently in the Merrill Dow case indicated a preference to have federal courts decide issues of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.411" offset="13620333">In answer to the question of how the General Motors' plan came into existence, General Motors and its labor unions negotiated a plan for hourly employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.052" offset="13678848">The salaried plan is fashioned from the hourly plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.373" offset="13696193">It's a result of General Motors adopting the plans that were negotiated and conferring with insurance companies to provide the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.229" offset="13731615">Lastly, General Motors did make an argument to the Sixth Circuit on page 21 of its opening brief that 502 alone provided sufficient language and granted the federal courts original jurisdiction separate and apart from preemption.</text>
