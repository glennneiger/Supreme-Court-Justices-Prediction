            <text syncTime="15.010" offset="191867">The question presented in this case is whether military personnel should be denied judicial review when seeking only equitable relief for constitutional, statutory, or regulatory violations committed by their superior officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.702" offset="254666">The question is whether Federal courts will ensure that military services will comply with the commands of the Constitution, of acts of Congress, and of their own regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="45.112" offset="312239">Mr. Milliken, you're not contending that the district court didn't review the constitutional issue on this case, are you?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen G. Milliken</label>
            <text syncTime="52.349" offset="341183">We contend that the district court more or less commented on the issue, but did not, in the context of this whistle-blower case, give significant protection to the speech engaged in by Captain Van Drasek, and did not employ the independent scrutiny of the entire record requiring... required in First Amendment cases, as this Court said in Bose v. Consumers Union--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="77.166" offset="440553">Well, you're really complaining that he didn't rule in your favor, which isn't the same thing as to say that you got no judicial review.</text>

          <turn speaker="stephen_g_milliken" startTime="85.504" stopTime="150.548">
            <label>Mr. Stephen G. Milliken</label>
            <text syncTime="85.504" offset="473885">--Mr. Chief Justice, the district court failed not only to apply a proper First Amendment scrutiny to the whistle-blower aspect of the case; the district court failed to review at all the substantive elements of the Article 138 complaint brought by Captain Van Drasek, and failed to acknowledge that the district court did have the power to review under the Administrative Procedures Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.519" offset="565941">Thus, it is our contention that indeed Captain Van Drasek was denied review of the entire record, by the district court's refusal to review the 138 record, to review the allegations of command influence, and the failures of investigations upon those complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.397" offset="633441">The district court, indeed, denied Captain Van Drasek jurisdiction over a core element of his claim, and thus, as the BCNR has done, the Board for Correction of Naval Records, did not perform the independent review required where there are matters of protected speech addressing matters of public concern that have been raised by a service member which result in that service member losing the military career to which he has devoted his life.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="150.548" stopTime="156.702">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="150.548" offset="734065">Will you make some comment, counsel, about whether the case is or is not moot?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen G. Milliken</label>
            <text syncTime="156.702" offset="758620">This case is not moot because, John Van Drasek, although he is medically disably retired, serves in his retirement as a Captain, at the rank of Captain.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.676" offset="810551">The relief we seek is a return to the Board for Correction of Naval Records with instruction that that body undertake the review of the Article 138 investigation; and that the Federal court remain open to protect the First And Fifth Amendment claims arising on this record; and that then John Van Drasek would be entitled, following that review, to be put before new promotion boards with deletion of the retaliatory material, in order that he could be properly considered for promotion to major.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.231" offset="940746">And thus the claim is not moot.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="205.849" offset="955270">But may I ask you, in that inquiry, can the review involve any matters that happened after his second failure to be promoted?</text>
            <text syncTime="217.657" offset="1002499">I gather the first one back in April of '82.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen G. Milliken</label>
            <text syncTime="220.526" offset="1013993">The first promotion passover occurred in April of 1982, and that promotion consideration occurred immediately following what it has been uncontested was a killer fitness report, an all-grade-B fitness report given to John Van Drasek by his commanding colonel, Colonel Cooper.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Stephen G. Milliken</label>
            <text syncTime="243.891" offset="1107407">That is absolutely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.093" offset="1112213">The second promotion passover which occurred by a board sitting in May of 1983, did of course follow all of the events raised in the 138 complaint by Captain Van Drasek.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.966" offset="1155681">And thus, the second promotion passover, which would trigger under the up-or-out rule, his separation from the corps, needed to take cognizance of all of the circumstances arising prior to the date of that second promotion report.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.256" offset="1204896">It is further significant that indeed--</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen G. Milliken</label>
            <text syncTime="276.545" offset="1238019">--We would submit that, yes, the fact that Captain Van Drasek is retired from the Marine Corps resulted from his medical disability discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.587" offset="1286189">The medical disability discharge processing occurred following a May 23rd letter mailed by Captain Van Drasek's original civilian counsel, Mr. Steinberg, to the services.</text>

            <text syncTime="304.863" offset="1351286">In May of '83.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.680" offset="1354525">Within three weeks of that letter being sent, at a time when it was requested that the Article 138 proceedings be reviewed, within three weeks, on June 14th, 1983, Captain Van Drasek was ordered to submit to a medical fitness board.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.575" offset="1418159">And there is in the record the comment that he was sent there by his commanding general because of--</text>

            <text syncTime="340.453" offset="1493601">I mean, his discharge was going to follow automatically.</text>

            <text syncTime="344.171" offset="1508543">And I only raise the matter of the orders for Captain Van Drasek to report to the medical fitness board as they came so closely on the retention of civilian counsel, as a further retaliatory event.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="355.963" stopTime="360.133">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="355.963" offset="1555668">But even if you're right about that, that didn't affect his military status.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_g_milliken" startTime="360.133" stopTime="558.896">
            <label>Mr. Stephen G. Milliken</label>
            <text syncTime="360.133" offset="1572386">No, that is correct, Mr. Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.569" offset="1582104">And I would suggest that there are four very clear events which occurred starting in October, 1981, when John Van Drasek first addressed the question of the denial of equal employment opportunity to pregnant Marines to his commanding colonel, and the immediate following of the killer fitness report.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.165" offset="1668517">And it has been uncontested that the bright line all-excellent fitness report was a killer report.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.219" offset="1692759">No outstanding marks for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.171" offset="1700491">It was aberrant in relationship to John Van Drasek's career.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.623" offset="1714283">That event was followed by John Van Drasek having failed in the personal face-to-face meeting with his commander to effect the equal employment opportunity for pregnant Marines, in drafting a proposed order for the Marine Corps Development and Education Command which would permit... and this was done after he had consulted with OB/GYN experts to ensure that there was no medical danger to pregnant Marines proceeding with the training at the noncommissioned officers leadership school.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.440" offset="1821594">And immediately after the proposal of that order, John Van Drasek received the second fitness report, with a predominance of excellent marks.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.027" offset="1851897">But more significantly, within one month, he was demoted from the director of the noncommissioned officers leadership school, to a position as an academics officer; from principal of the school to a teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.021" offset="1907903">And thereupon followed his assignment to the administrative discharge board by his commanding general.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.340" offset="1929219">General Toomey.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.574" offset="1934130">When he voted in the third incident, with the unanimous board, to retain a Marine, despite an alleged drug abuse problem, he was removed from the next administrative discharge board by his commanding colonel, Colonel Cooper, and that is in direct violation of the orders from the commanding general, General Toomey, who had placed him in that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.790" offset="2018976">There was no power within Colonel Cooper to remove Captain Van Drasek from that administrative discharge board.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.360" offset="2049278">When he voted, in the fourth incident, for an honorable discharge to a Marine North, the very same day as that vote occurred, he was transferred out of that command entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.453" offset="2101627">He was returned, after a face-to-face with his commanding Colonel Cooper.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.488" offset="2117823">Then he broke his leg parachuting, and he was transferred, again demoted, to the position of publications processor.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.392" offset="2145408">Thus the incidents, we would submit the district court was wrong in just pointing to the two fitness reports as giving rise to the demotion of Captain Van Drasek.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.866" offset="2187309">Because on the fitness report brief, may it please the Court, the fitness report the promotion boards who consider captains rising to the rank of major, see the marks they receive; but they also see their duty assignments and their grades.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.376" offset="2249376">And thus, from the time John Van Drasek sat on that administrative discharge board, his career... and all he did was vote his conscience; we're talking about a situation where an executive officer who institutes charges, if displeased by what a court does, then summarily abuses or removes or takes unlawful action against a court, this is a corruption of a tribunal by command influence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1102.233" offset="4540732">In that circumstance, we would submit that the court, the reviewing BCNR and then the reviewing Federal court, should undertake the First and Fifth Amendment review required in a whistle-blower case to look at the entire record of events, all of the lawful actions taken by John Van Drasek, everyone of them required of him by law, and all of the unlawful retaliatory actions undertaken against him, both in connection with the EEO giving rise to the retaliatory fitness reports, and in regard to the complaints about command influence giving rise to his removal, transfer and demotions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1219.794" offset="5011041">In the case of a whistle-blower case arising in a government agency, there is a balancing which has been written to require an evaluation of the degree of speech, the protection to be accorded it, and the degree of intrusion in the service which the agency is providing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.505" offset="5085856">In the military's case, it would be appropriate in that balancing to ensure that the judges, to quote from Orloff v. Willoughby, are not given the task of running the Army.</text>

            <text syncTime="1682.263" offset="6860928">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.282" offset="6872945">As the preceding colloquy indicates, there is some uncertainty as to the precise question presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.971" offset="6907740">In his petition, petitioner stated the question at issue to be, whether citizens should be barred from all redress in civilian courts for constitutional wrong suffered in the course of military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.480" offset="6965732">Now we explained in our brief why we felt that question was not in fact presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.384" offset="6989346">The reason is simple, as Chief Justice Rehnquist pointed out in the preceding colloquy, the district court did entertain and decide petitioner's constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.275" offset="7036889">Essentially, he raised two claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.459" offset="7045666">First, he charged that the military's processing of his Article 138 complaint violated his Fifth Amendment due process rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.683" offset="7094568">The district court specifically considered and rejected that claim, in its opinion at page A6 of the petition, the court said, the court finds that the processing of plaintiff's Article 138 complaint comports with constitutional requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.746" offset="7174816">The investigation, report of findings, and remedial action, satisfied the minimum standards of procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.936" offset="7211596">That finding was in turn affirmed by the Court of Appeals, and petitioners offered no reason to think that it is in any way incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.042" offset="7247959">He has in fact failed to specify any procedural defect in the Article 138 proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.731" offset="7274812">Petitioner's second constitutional claim was that his First Amendment rights were violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.801" offset="7303025">That claim was also considered and rejected by the district court on the same page of its opinion, when it said, plaintiff's allegations of First Amendment violations similarly do not warrant relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.894" offset="7359449">Now, in his reply brief, petitioner appears to acknowledge that his constitutional claims were decided by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.767" offset="7398946">He argues, however, that the court didn't scrutinize the record, the entire record, before deciding those constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.956" offset="7435622">Now the basis for that claim is not altogether clear, but he appears to rely on the fact that the court declined to review the Article 138 proceeding for substantive correctness, and draws from that the conclusion that the court must therefore have truncated its review of the constitutional claims by ignoring any facts relevant to the Article 138 proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.190" offset="7540634">In other words, the court shut its eyes to crucial facts underlying the constitutional claims before it decided those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.696" offset="7578669">Now there's no basis for that argument whatsoever in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.850" offset="7595283">The district court specifically stated that it was reviewing the record for constitutional violations, and that it found none.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.419" offset="7625480">In the course of its opinion, it canvassed all the relevant facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.323" offset="7645124">Now admittedly, its discussion of the constitutional claims was brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.644" offset="7666440">But there's a very simple explanation for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.096" offset="7680233">The district court discussed in some detail, in the context of the review of the BCNR proceedings, petitioner's claims that his fitness reports were biased, and that he was improperly passed over for promotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.141" offset="7752435">The district court discussed those claims in detail, and affirmed them in finding that the BCNR's decision was supported by substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.913" offset="7783469">So when it came to the constitutional claims, the underlying factual basis for those claims had already been eliminated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2078.721" offset="8446770">First, that his first two fitness reports, and his first promotion passover, were in retaliation for his complaints that he made about sex discrimination at the officers candidates school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.313" offset="8501105">Second, he claims that he was transferred out of the officers candidate school, and removed from the administrative discharge board in retaliation for his votes as a member of the administrative discharge board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.372" offset="8557320">Third, he claims that his second promotion passover was in retaliation for having filed the Article 138 complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.078" offset="8592115">Now, the BCNR specifically addressed and rejected the first and the third of those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.548" offset="8618029">In other words, it found that the fitness reports were not biased, and the first promotion passover was not in anyway improper.</text>

            <text syncTime="2385.055" offset="9672017">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.007" offset="9687900">Captain Van Drasek has had his claim parsed by the BCNR, by the district court, by the officer of the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.880" offset="9727397">And what he seeks is merely to have his First and Fifth Amendment claims reviewed on one whole factual record, in one court, at one time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.289" offset="9784971">Whether this Court would grant relief by returning John Van Drasek to the Board for Correction of Naval Records, with instructions that the Board for correction of Naval Records is empowered to review the elements of the 138 investigation which pertain to his separation from the Marines, or whether that power lies in the district court, it is the petitioner's contention that to bar First Amendment whistle-blower cases from review is to effectively close the doors to the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.379" offset="9917359">And where relief is only sought of an equitable nature, that then this Court would not have constitutional power exercised by the Federal courts over the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.853" offset="9971276">Captain Van Drasek asks that the matter be returned to the BCNR or the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.007" offset="9991861">Captain Van Drasek in both courts made very clear that the appointment by General Carey of Colonel Lawson to interpret the complaints against Colonel Cooper, the appointment of a peer in the same command, was violative of the JAG manual; was a procedural impropriety which made the 138 investigation void from the outset; that the failure to do a formal hearing, that the failure to appoint counsel, indeed, to tell John Van Drasek, that he could talk to a JAG lawyer, but he couldn't establish an independent attorney-client relationship with a lawyer; all of those procedural irregularities have been pled by the petitioner throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.732" offset="10146714">Thus, he has done nothing other than by the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.601" offset="10158208">He has gone to every court which this Court suggested in Chappell v. Wallace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.703" offset="10174613">He has come before this Court, and been granted an opportunity once again to say that he would like to have his claim heard in its entirety under the Constitution at one time in one place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.443" offset="10221634">Thank you very much.</text>
