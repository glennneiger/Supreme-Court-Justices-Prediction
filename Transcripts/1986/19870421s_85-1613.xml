            <text syncTime="16.377" offset="157197">In the John Doe case, we are presented with two questions involving the Federal Rules and Civil Procedure that govern the secrecy of grand jury material.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.803" offset="198993">After the grand jury had completed its investigation of a possible antitrust violation and had not returned any indictments, the government attorneys in charge of the investigation thought it would be appropriate to bring a civil case, and they obtained a permission from the district judge to disclose some of the materials to lawyers in the civil division.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.228" offset="304632">One of the questions whether it was sufficient particularized need for that disclosure or should they have gone through civil discovery procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.135" offset="340263">The second question is whether a lawyer who participated in the criminal investigation and later is going to work in a civil case, is in effect making an un-permitted disclosure when he continues to use the materials that he already had in his capacity before the grand jury, and the district court, as I say, allowed the disclosure to the Civil Division and also did not find any disclosure violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.554" offset="449977">The Court of Appeals however reversed considering that the continued use later on was tantamount to the disclosure and there was not particularized need.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.229" offset="484668">We, in turn, reverse the Court of Appeals holding that the showing was adequate and that continued use does not come within the language of the rule prohibiting to disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.083" offset="528031">Justice Brennan has filed a dissent joined by Justice Marshall and Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.835" offset="547048">Justice White did not participate in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
