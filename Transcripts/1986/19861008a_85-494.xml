            <label>Mr. Theodore B. Olson</label>
            <text syncTime="14.624" offset="207456">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.193" offset="217800">This case comes to this Court on writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals after that Court reversed a District Court summary judgment in favor of petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.483" offset="258969">This case presents a conflict between two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.101" offset="277359">Federal law forbids employers to discriminate for any employment purpose on the basis of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.958" offset="304840">California law, on the other hand, requires employers to provide special job protections to employees disabled by pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.564" offset="339217">The question presented by this case is whether the federal mandate of equal protection prevails over the state policy of special protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.003" offset="377043">The facts of this case are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.622" offset="387492">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act, the PDA, makes it an unlawful employment practice to discriminate against any individual on the basis of sex, including pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.731" offset="451962">The PDA expressly requires that women affected by pregnancy shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes as persons experiencing other disabilities similarly affecting their ability to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.158" offset="509640">Petitioners comply with Title VII by implementing employment policies which treat pregnancy exactly the same as other temporary conditions which might affect an employee's ability to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.032" offset="557079">Such policies vary, but as relevant here, do not provide immediate guaranteed reinstatement rights on return from disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.221" offset="589888">In contrast, California's statute requires employers to grant up to four months' leave for pregnancy, with a right to return to the same or similar position.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.445" offset="634819">As respondents' brief puts it, and summarizes the California requirement, the California statute guarantees reasonable unpaid leave and reinstatement of female employees disabled by pregnancy; and thus ensures that pregnancy disability will not cause female employees to lose their jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.091" offset="713395">Petitioners' declaratory relief action was resolved in District Court on cross motions for summary judgment based on stipulated facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.696" offset="743802">The District Court ruled for petitioners, concluding that the state law requires preferential treatment for female employees, and was therefore inconsistent with, and preempted by, Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.904" offset="788628">The Ninth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.356" offset="798450">There are two basic conflicts presented by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.724" offset="811929">In summary, they are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.158" offset="821647">One, the equal treatment versus special treatment issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.378" offset="842545">Petitioner, along with the United States, the National Organization of Women, the United States Chamber of Commerce, the American Civil Liberties Union, and numerous others contend that federal law categorically and unambiguously forbids pregnancy discrimination and requires that employers treat pregnancy on the same basis as other temporary disabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.910" offset="928644">California adheres to a diametrically opposed philosophy, that pregnancy requires that women be treated differently in order that may be treated equally.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="204.849" offset="968350">Well, Mr. Olson, I guess in theory, an employer could comply with the California state law by offering female employees the pregnancy leave, and comply with Title VII by offering comparable leave to other disabled employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.495" offset="1042956">And if that is the case, how is the California law preemptive?</text>
            <text syncTime="228.381" offset="1062496">I guess in theory that's certainly one way to approach it.</text>

            <text syncTime="233.452" offset="1082767">And it is theoretically possible, as you suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.404" offset="1094574">We submit that that is an end run, as the United States put it in their brief, around the extension versus validation issue, which is the same... which is the second issue that I was going to mention and summarize; that in essence, it would require employers to bring up the benefits that they are required by California law to give to female employees who are pregnant, to all employees suffering any disability that would take them away from work.</text>

            <text syncTime="1657.232" offset="6777879">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.767" offset="6796060">The Pregnancy Discrimination Act amended Title VII to ensure that equality of employment opportunity would not be denied on the basis of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.040" offset="6825108">And the only issue in this case is whether California's guarantee that pregnant employees not lose their jobs is in any way inconsistent with that federal goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.611" offset="6859485">And California submits that common sense, in addition to the statutory language and history, requires that the answer be no; that all that the two laws do is to ensure that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.204" offset="6909849">And as the Court noted in its questioning of Mr. Olson, nothing in California's law requires employers to violate Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.040" offset="6937121">What I would like to do this morning is, first, to describe California's law, and then to describe the PDA in Title VII, and correct what I believe is Cal Fed's erroneous interpretation of the federal law; and finally, to show how California's law does promote equality for both men and women and prevent discrimination, once those concepts, equality and discrimination, are properly understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.354" offset="7014444">California Government Code 12945(b)(2) helps insure that working women do not lose their jobs because of pregnancy disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.794" offset="7052164">And when women employees become pregnant... and approximately 85 percent of working women will become pregnant at some time during their working lives... that inevitably causes them to be absent from their jobs for some limited period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.184" offset="7097722">Now, what California has done, and all that California has done, is to say that women may return to their work once that period of pregnancy disability is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.707" offset="7135861">And for most women, for 95 percent of women, that's approximately a six week period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.509" offset="7154982">So basically it's a right to keep your job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.844" offset="7164386">It's not a guarantee as to any paid benefits, or any type of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.681" offset="7179746">It's not a guarantee of any additional voluntary time off for child care or parenting needs--</text>

            <text syncTime="1891.881" offset="7716510">Now, since this is a Title VII preemption question, I think the Court understands that Title VII has a very limited preemptive effect upon state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.070" offset="7753291">And Congress has said in effect that states may make practices unlawful, whether or not such practices also violate federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.491" offset="7782966">And the only restriction is that you cannot require employers to violate or purport to excuse violations of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.329" offset="7810342">It would be inconsistent with the purposes of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.031" offset="7821105">And in our circumstances, warranting preemption of the state statute under Title VII, simply don't exist here, since Title VII forbids discrimination on the basis of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.220" offset="7861856">And nothing in the California statute is inconsistent with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.089" offset="7873350">Now, what Cal Fed claims Title VII says is that Title VII is satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.159" offset="7893621">But more than being satisfied, that it requires employers to treat pregnancy exactly the same as persons with other medical conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.480" offset="7926953">In particular, they reserve the right to terminate any employee on a disability leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.300" offset="7942208">But that interpretation of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act is invalid for several different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.120" offset="7969480">First of all, it ignores the first clause of the PDA, which defines sex discrimination to include pregnancy discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.858" offset="7996439">And once that substantive definition is substituted in 7038, which gives content to what's an unlawful practice under Title VII, it then becomes unlawful for an employer to adversely affect an employee's status because of that employee's pregnancy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2026.967" offset="8256827">And in fact, Cal Fed's analysis would lead to the absurd result that the guarantee against pregnancy discrimination would have no substantive content; you could treat pregnant employees as harshly as you treat employees with other medical conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.643" offset="8315550">For example, there is nothing unlawful under Title VII if an employer chose to fire all employees with, say, diabetes, whether or not that person was able to work.</text>

            <text syncTime="2053.168" offset="8361630">The flaw in Cal Fed's analysis, I think, is to equate pregnancy discrimination with discrimination against other disabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.139" offset="8389529">And what Title VII did is to equate pregnancy discrimination with sex discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2066.043" offset="8413144">And the other flaw in Cal Fed's interpretation of the PDA is that if the same treatment always satisfies Title VII, and nothing more is ever required, that you can treat pregnancy as badly as you treat every other medical condition, then that undercuts this Court's line of reasoning beginning with Criggs v. Duke Power, which is applied to pregnancy in the Satty case, saying that you cannot have an employment practice which adversely affects a group of pregnant women because of their pregnancy, because that is inevitably sex discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2392.553" offset="9719162">But when you consider providing pregnancy disability, I think it's important to keep in mind that Title VII forbids sex discrimination, including pregnancy discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2404.860" offset="9768481">And maybe it doesn't even make sense to talk about disability... pregnancy disability even in terms of whether or not it discriminates against men.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.133" offset="9801500">I think that may be why in the Newport News case, this Court found that it was ordinary sex discrimination, not pregnancy discrimination, to provide the same benefits to male employees and their spouses as was provided to female employees and their spouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.857" offset="9852386">But here, it's really irrelevant to male employees whether or not an employer provides pregnancy disability leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.595" offset="9879345">The male employee is going to keep his job when he has a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.380" offset="9890525">There's no interruption of his work life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.915" offset="9896690">There's no problem with him keeping his job despite the fact that he's decided to have a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.367" offset="9914453">On the other hand, it would be disastrous to women if they risk losing their jobs if they decide to have families.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.139" offset="9941516">So when it's viewed in that light, it's neither preferential nor prejudicial to either men or women; it's simply an equalizer making sure that women, like men, don't have to choose between employment and childbirth, that they can combine both, and that women can complete equally with men on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.916" offset="10004628">And the concept of equality that California would like the Court to keep in mind is that although the basic principle is that similarly situated persons are to be treated alike, something very different has to occur when persons are not similar situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.528" offset="10071084">Because in those circumstances, similar treatment may in fact lead to inequality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.245" offset="10089996">And maybe in most circumstances, men and women are equally situated regarding pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.835" offset="10120298">That was certainly true in Newport News, where both male and female employees had pregnancy-related expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.405" offset="10142659">But it's not true regarding the need for pregnancy disability leave, which once again, is simply something that is irrelevant to men.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.226" offset="10169931">They keep their jobs anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.459" offset="10174842">But it's very essential for women.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.459" offset="10182783">So that providing pregnancy disability leave is consistent both with the goal of providing equality of employment opportunity without discrimination on the basis of sex, and insuring that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy does not occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.687" offset="10255717">The PDA was intended to give effect to the Court's dissent in Gilbert.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.674" offset="10279645">And one very critical statement in that dissent, which the Ninth Circuit relied upon in upholding the California statute, was the statement that a realistic understanding of today's labor environment warrants taking pregnancy into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.434" offset="10334711">And that's precisely what California has done as well as either other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.819" offset="10356236">And in passing the PDA, Congress specifically noted two of those states, Montana and Connecticut, that at that time already had a statute very similar to the one that's under consideration here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.694" offset="10403779">So Congress was obviously aware of those statutes, and said, federal law may not go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.930" offset="10424677">But we're not preventing states, if they wish to, to do something in addition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.732" offset="10439933">And the state obviously has a very strong interest in protecting the rights of both men and women employees to keep working and not to lose their jobs on a basis that the other group is not subject to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.011" offset="10501059">But it's not just an adverse effect upon pregnant employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.813" offset="10520285">It would be an adverse upon their families, upon the state's disability and employment insurance compensation programs, and on the right to procreation itself, if for any reason, women faced a choice between keeping their jobs or having a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.590" offset="10583397">And what the California statute says is that women, just like men, don't have to face any conflict between the two; that they have the same opportunity as men to combine childbirth and employment; and can become parents without risking job loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.684" offset="10643688">So it removes an unequal burden that men never face.</text>

            <text syncTime="2984.064" offset="12085229">And if that happens, Your Honor, then this particular California statute does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.716" offset="12099857">What would happen then would be what Justice O'Connor was suggesting, in that you would have to prove a typical Title VII or employment discrimination case in showing that failing to give more than four months had an adverse impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.957" offset="12144788">Whether it does or doesn't is really irrelevant to this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3002.059" offset="12157222">What I wanted to point out by my question is that there is an area of general legislation in the California statute where they specify four months as the period that the limit can't exceed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3013.034" offset="12201108">That is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.667" offset="12203616">They have made a presumption that four months will take care of the majority of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.368" offset="12222424">And there may be some pregnant employees that... for which that is not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.605" offset="12239456">But what we would like the Court to keep in mind is that California's guarantee is purely for job retention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.378" offset="12278535">And in being sure that pregnant employees keep their jobs, it not only is not inconsistent, but we believe it's perfectly compatible and consistent with Title VII's goal of equality for both and women, despite the fact that only women become pregnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.090" offset="12349379">It doesn't require employers to violate Title VII in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.624" offset="12367456">It simply corrects for a biological burden that only women, and not men, in the workforce face.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.795" offset="12392220">And, finally, that it is a legitimate exercise of California's authority to ensure that equal employment opportunity will not be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.567" offset="12423253">Unless the Court has any further questions, thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3080.525" offset="12471110">This case is about assumptions regarding groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.894" offset="12492530">The United States Congress decided that assumptions on the basis of pregnancy were impermissible in the workforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.552" offset="12535162">California has made an assumption about pregnant individuals that they need some extra assistance in order to be equalized in the workplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.176" offset="12577689">The effect of the California statute is inconsistent with the Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.330" offset="12602349">The purpose of the California statute is squarely inconsistent with the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.365" offset="12622411">And the philosophy of the California statute is inconsistent with the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.352" offset="12642368">The federal law, and Congress, throughout the legislative history in hearings relative to this matter, assumed that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.327" offset="12686254">The assumption here in part of this debate has been that there's some sort of favorable discrimination going on in the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.247" offset="12713944">Congress assumed, and stated, that discrimination was wrong; and that there is no, in this context, favorable discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.586" offset="12751351">Because it requires and causes people to have assumptions about groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.240" offset="12769950">It is the point that the ACLU is making in footnote 30 which I read, and I believe it's the point that Justice O'Connor was making for the Court in the Mississippi University case, that those assumptions about groups, that they need some extra help, in order to be equal with everyone else, ultimately causes damage.</text>
