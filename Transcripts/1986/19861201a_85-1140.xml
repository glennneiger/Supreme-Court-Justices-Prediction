            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="148848">We will hear argument first this morning in No. 85-1140, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company against Buell.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.939" offset="192525">Mr. Lee, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="15.641" stopTime="278.842">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="15.641" offset="211333">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a statutory construction case.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.061" offset="233067">There are two statutes to be construed and they are the two that govern relations between employers and employees in the railroad industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.583" offset="267130">On the one hand, the Railway Labor Act provides for exclusive mandatory nonjudicial resolution of so-called minor disputes which the Act defines as all disputes growing out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.462" offset="342677">The basic objective of this minor dispute part of the Railway Labor Act was to assure that workplace controversies would be resolved by persons who were expert in railroad matters and by processes less cumbersome than courts can offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.072" offset="409132">The Federal Employers Liability Act, on the other hand, gives a special federally created remedy against railroads for injuries that they cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.029" offset="448943">The problem in this case arises out of the fact that you have one federal statute that precludes a judicial remedy while the other provides a judicial remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.820" offset="492097">Nevertheless, over the 60 years that these two statutes have existed side by side there has been very little conflict between them, and the reason is simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.276" offset="529922">So long as the RLA is given, as it usually has been, its traditional usually understood meaning as applying to the resolution of workplace disputes, that is, how the shop ought to be run and what the relationship should be between supervisor and employee, and the FELA on the other hand is given its traditional, usually understood meaning as applying to the redress of physical injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.326" offset="638069">Then there will be few cases, if any, in which courts will have any difficulty deciding which statute covers which case.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.913" offset="672446">Clearly, if that approach is followed here there is no question how this case must be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.833" offset="700136">Mr. Buell's grievance against his employer, Santa Fe, really boils down to a disagreement with his foreman, Mr. Wright, over their respective duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.005" offset="736812">He makes three basic allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.124" offset="749246">The first is that he had been given two conflicting sets of instructions as to how to fill out car inspection reports, second, that he was forced to assist Mr. Wright in what he considered to be illegal activity, namely or principally removing ice and plywood from the yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.317" offset="814030">And third, and beyond any question the most important, that his supervisor aid not adequately discipline other employees and prevent them from ridiculing and intimidating Mr. Buell by doing such things as posting anonymous cartoons making fun of Mr. Buell's physical appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.380" offset="886337">The first step taken by the respondent and other employees was to initiate RLA grievance procedures on account of Mr. Wright's alleged wrongdoings, and then about a year later Mr. Buell filed this FELA suit alleging that Santa Fe had wrongfully failed to prevent his foreman and his fellow employees from intimidating him, as a result of which he suffered severe mental and emotional injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.698" offset="991558">He did not allege any physical injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.817" offset="1004097">Several federal courts of appeals and district courts have cautioned against the potential for effectively repealing the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.506" offset="1046833">Through what those courts have called artful pleading in drafting personal injury complaints under either the RLA... excuse me, under either the FELA or state law, and ironically the most thoughtful of those opinions comes out of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.300" offset="1109945">This case is the classic example of why that is a legitimate concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.538" offset="1134918">Look at the issues that are going to have to be resolved by whoever decides this cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.656" offset="1155398">They arise out of disagreements between an employee and his foreman over the rules of the shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.928" offset="1180476">Were there in fact conflicting instructions, and if so then which instruction should prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.064" offset="1201060">What are the company rules concerning taking scrap plywood home?</text>
            <text syncTime="267.718" offset="1219659">And most important of all, what are the foreman's obligations to keep other employees from making fun of Mr. Buell?</text>
            <text syncTime="275.205" offset="1249648">Those are the issues in this case.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="278.842" offset="1264172">Mr. Lee, wouldn't that also be the case if you had just a standard FELA negligence action where prior to the accident there had been complaints about slipshod procedures within the shop or about some other matters that would constitute negligence?</text>
            <text syncTime="302.625" offset="1359258">You could grieve those, those negligence matters, and instead of grieving them you certainly could bring an FELA lawsuit later.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.346" offset="1406174">This case is different simply because there is no legitimate FELA complaint that has been stated.</text>

            <text syncTime="327.020" offset="1456851">Well, that is quite a different issue, and I was going to ask you that, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.189" offset="1469599">Why is there any... if you want to talk about artful pleading I would think the artful pleading consists of causing an intentional injury to become a negligent injury within the meaning of the FELA by simply saying that a foreman who inflicts intentional injury is not adequately supervised.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.919" offset="1548489">Are you making that assertion here, that this matter is not even covered by the FELA anyway?</text>

            <text syncTime="355.321" offset="1570118">We are making two arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.989" offset="1576701">The first is, we are doing all of it in the context of the general proposition that in order to reach a proper accommodation between these two statutes, what you have to look at is, first, what is the interpretation of each that will harmonize the two so as to minimize the conflict between them, and then you have to ask yourself what is the real thrust of this particular complaint?</text>
            <text syncTime="383.473" offset="1682654">Is it really in the nature of a traditional FELA complaint which is tied to physical injury or is it, does it really arise out of a disagreement as to what are the rules of the shop and who is to do what in this particular--</text>

            <text syncTime="409.305" offset="1785994">And the injury alleged here is proximately intentionally causing emotional distress which may or may not, depending on which side you believe, have led to properly alleged physical injury, but you know, proximately you have intentional action on the part of the foreman and some of the coworkers causing emotional distress, and that has been converted into a negligence action by saying that it was the company's failure adequately to supervise that constitutes the negligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="674.056" offset="2844998">We have two arguments and they have been correctly summarized by the Chief Justice, and one of them is, this is not an FELA case.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.773" offset="2867881">Now, if it were an FELA case then what you have to do at that point is to ask... there are really two subsequent questions that you ask.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.927" offset="2900482">The first one is, is the real gravamen of this dispute, does the real gravamen of this particular dispute put it into the RLA came or the FELA camp, and that is the approach that was taken by the Ninth Circuit in its earlier Magnuson decision, and we think that is the one that... that is an approach that has to be taken if you are to avoid the artful pleading type of problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.542" offset="2987000">Now, there can be some instances, and perhaps this is the thrust of what Justice Scalia is asking, there can be some instances nevertheless when you have a hard time saying, well, does it squarely fit in one or does it squarely fit in the other, and under those circumstances we contend that the tilt should be, in the close cases, should be toward the Railway Labor Act for a couple of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.789" offset="3071950">One is that the basic question here is a question of what is the proper forum, and it is the Railway Labor Act that deals precisely with that issue of what should be the proper forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.929" offset="3120538">Let me deal just briefly then with the Ninth Circuit... what we consider to be the Ninth Circuit's error on both of these grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.952" offset="3152616">First of all, that the Railway Labor Act... it should have held that the Railway Labor Act does apply, and second, that it should have held that the FELA does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.975" offset="3192740">There is no question that this case involves a disagreement that arises out of the employment relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.747" offset="3227744">It is at bottom a disagreement over how to run a railroad and who should be doing what toward that end.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.151" offset="3257419">But the respondent nevertheless contends that a workplace controversy is not a minor dispute subject to the RLA's compulsory grievance procedures unless it involves the interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.410" offset="3310396">That is the respondent's principal argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.528" offset="3322935">It is the principal issue that is discussed in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.878" offset="3332339">It is essential to his case in our view, and it is the lynchpin of the RLA part of the Ninth Circuit's opinion, but in our view it is wrong for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.968" offset="3364626">The first is that it just doesn't apply to this case because, as explained in our briefs this controversy does involve interpretation of the bargaining agreement, specifically Rules 39 and 40, which are discussed in our briefs, and remarkably have never been addressed by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.680" offset="3431499">But the even more important point is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.964" offset="3440695">If this dispute were not covered by the bargaining agreement, then you have effectively repealed part of the RLA because by its terms it applies to, and I am quoting,</text>
            <text syncTime="835.205" offset="3489596">"all disputes growing out of grievances or the interpretation or application of bargaining agreements. "</text>
            <text syncTime="841.759" offset="3515823">That language very simply could not be more plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.145" offset="3529406">The respondent cites cases saying that the RLA applies to interpretation of the bargaining agreement, and of course it does, but it also applies to something else, and that something else is grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.603" offset="3579248">Otherwise why would Congress have used this disjunctive, "or".</text>
            <text syncTime="861.507" offset="3594817">The legislative history makes it very clear that Congress meant what it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.791" offset="3611953">We have those citations in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.141" offset="3621357">I will refer just to the one from Congressman Barkley, who was the principal legislative sponsor of this bill, that what they wanted to do was to resolve, and I am quoting,</text>

            <text syncTime="946.458" offset="3934618">We think the only way to prevent that is to ask in each instance what is the real thrust of this particular claim, and if it is physical injury, if what he is talking about is the traditional kind of thing that has fallen within the FELA, then the FELA prevails, but if it does not, if the real thrust of what he is complaining about is how the workshop ought to be run, what are the rules of the railroad, then it ought to be an RLA grievable offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="988.551" offset="4102951">The reason that in Farmer this Court held that state law does not... excuse me, that the National Labor Relations Act does not preempt state law was twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.524" offset="4150912">The first is that in Farmer the Court simply reasoned that there was nothing in the National Labor Relations Act that would be impeded by allowing arbitration to... excuse me, by allowing personal injuries to go ahead under state law, but the difference between the NLRA and the RLA is very significant in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.074" offset="4249132">The central focus of the Railway Labor Act is a dispute or at least the minor disputes part of it is a dispute resolution process that is extrajudicial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1390.156" offset="5709377">Nevertheless he argues that the FELA should now be given coverage more broad than Congress intended in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.012" offset="5748874">We think that is wrong for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.612" offset="5755248">The first is that if the FELA is to be expanded in this coverage it ought to be Congress that does it rather than the Court, but even more important is this, that if you interpret the FELA as expansively as my opponent would suggest, then you do put these two federal statutes into conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.841" offset="5836123">The basic error of the Court of Appeals approach was that it went out of its way to create conflict between these two federal statutes by giving an unnecessarily crabbed interpretation to the RLA by saying that it applied, that it did not apply to this circumstance notwithstanding the existence of these provisions in the bargaining agreement and notwithstanding the fact that under any circumstance this dispute is really about how to run a railroad, and then gave an unnecessarily expansive interpretation to the FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.896" offset="5968407">As long as the two are carefully interpreted each sensitive to the needs of the other, then there need never... then there is no reason that the two cannot continue to coexist for another 60 years as they have over the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.791" offset="6036012">This point is really driven home by the respondent's attempt to change his allegations once the case gets before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.016" offset="6084809">He now contends for the first time before this Court that he really has alleged physical injury for reasons stated at Pages 17 and 18 of our brief it is our view that that cannot be done before this Court, that he has presented one state of facts before the lower courts, the Ninth Circuit has made its ruling on the basis of that state of facts, and we are now entitled to have that ruling reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.781" offset="6179895">But even more important is this, that even if he were now permitted to change his allegations this would not save the Court of Appeals holding, and the reason is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.922" offset="6220437">Congress determined 60 years ago that disputes over how the workplace should be run are to be resolved nonjudicially.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.295" offset="6262024">That Congressional judgment can be thwarted by the wording of complaints unless courts at some appropriate point ask the question, what is the real gravamen of this grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.018" offset="6308835">Is the real thrust of this dispute an FELA cognizable injury or is it really a disagreement over how to run the shop?</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.458" offset="6342585">Here there is no question that the real focus of Mr. Buell's grievance is friction between a foreman and his employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.964" offset="6376649">This is not a case that concerns gastritis or one employee bumping another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.618" offset="6399219">The real grievance here is that Mr. Wright was not doing a good enough job of keeping the other men in line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.955" offset="6428580">And this is borne out by the fact that the physical injury argument wasn't even made until the case reached this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.043" offset="6457001">Mr. Chief Justice, unless the Court has further questions I would like to save the rest of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1584.214" offset="6485632">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, it is my privilege to address you today as counsel of record for Jim Buell, a veteran railroad worker of over ten years' employment with the Santa Fe Railroad who in October of 1981 sustained a severe and grievous injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.752" offset="6607780">Of that there can be no doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.802" offset="6616035">Certainly the primary aspect of his injury was psychiatric.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.822" offset="6636097">He was confined to a psychiatric ward in St. Joseph's Hospital in Stockton, California, for 17 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.493" offset="6662742">For six months he was on psychiatric medication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.778" offset="6675908">Over a year on psychotherapy before he could go back to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.580" offset="6691163">His admitting physician, psychiatrist Robert Austin, said the man suffered a severe psychotic illness related to pressures on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.019" offset="6732855">The injury, we submit, was grave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.371" offset="6746229">Santa Fe's position in the lower court was simply that because the facts or some of the facts that were necessarily alleged in the FELA action involved a dispute or controversy or friction if you will between Mr. Wright and his foreman, Mr. Buell, pardon me, Mr. Buell and his foreman, Mr. Wright, that Mr. Buell was precluded and unable to use the FELA as a vehicle to attain redress for the injuries he suffered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.859" offset="6872244">Now, that position has altered in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.294" offset="6885932">Now the focus has been more on the fact that psychiatric injury is the primary ill or grievance that Mr. Buell suffered in October.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.101" offset="6933161">The Santa Fe position, I think, needs some elaboration by me on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.707" offset="6959597">Basically Mr. Buell had worked for Santa Fe for ten years before Mr. Wright became his foreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.694" offset="6983526">Friction developed between the two some time after Mr. Wright became foreman in the fall of 1979.</text>

            <text syncTime="1782.659" offset="7279441">The motion for summary judgment was basically met on the basis of a point of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1882.822" offset="7680055">That was really resolved long before this course of conduct about which we really complain.</text>

            <text syncTime="1916.959" offset="7816623">Isn't the source of the grievance that the employer by reason of his collective bargaining agreement has an obligation, a contractual obligation not to let his supervisors behave in this fashion?</text>

            <text syncTime="1935.021" offset="7888930">If you approach it as a grievance, but, Justice Scalia, under the FELA Congress was very clear about wanting to make the master responsible for the acts of the fellow servants in the workplace, in the railroad workplace, and it would seem to me that the FELA imposes a duty on Santa Fe to take reasonable steps to see that their foremen do not abuse their workmen, so in that sense it seems to me a classic FELA case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1970.194" offset="8029573">The particular quotation from the House report on the FELA in 1908 that supports this, and it is very, very clear on the notion that Congress wanted the master to police, if you will, the acts of the servants so they didn't injure one another appears at Page 42 in the Buell brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.774" offset="8111911">After the grievance proceeding which Santa Fe chose to take no action on, there was a letter by the union representative, Mr. Pickleman, who was a supervisor overseeing the work of Mr. Wright on June 6th saying the men are still complaining about the intimidation and harassment and the tactics that Mr. Wright uses in running the work crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.207" offset="8201668">After this, there was harassment directed to Mr. Buell that is outlined in the Buell brief and there is no need to go into it, but that is the course of activity of which Mr. Buell complains, really, the harassment, the intimidation, and the acts after the grievance proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.334" offset="8278154">If I may, I would like to offer an analogy which I think is somewhat helpful to clarify the difference between the Santa Fe position and ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.524" offset="8310859">If you assume that you had a dangerous foreman, a foreman who was sadistic, clearly that would be a grievable matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.331" offset="8358089">The workers, workmen under the foremen could grieve it, they could get the union representative in and they could present the issue to Santa Fe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.771" offset="8395914">If Santa Fe chose to take no action and a number of months went by and the foreman then became infuriated with one of the men on the job who had complained about his activities previously and brought a gun onto the worksite and shot that workman we contend there would be no conceivable way that the FELA would not give a cause of action to the foreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.184" offset="8477521">Now, to bring it much closer to this case and make it almost all fours on Mr. Buell's complaint, if we assume that after the nonproductive grievance the foreman some months later becomes infuriated with one of the men who complained about his conduct as a foreman, brings a gun onto the worksite, but the gun isn't loaded, but of course the worker does not know that, and the foreman points it at the worker and pulls the trigger and it just goes click.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.483" offset="8574696">Now, in that situation let's further assume that the workman in fear of his life has a psychiatric event, and has a psychiatric breakdown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.755" offset="8607819">That, I submit, is very, very close to the exact facts that we have in this case, and I doubt that Congress would have wanted to preclude or shut the federal courthouse doors to that workman when he wanted to come in and try and make his proofs to the court under the FELA.</text>

            <text syncTime="3046.709" offset="12335597">We would have a situation where if the state of Nevada... well, the state of California does acknowledge infliction of emotional distress, and the FELA has been interpreted by the California Supreme Court in 1960 to allow it, as I point out in the brief, for 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.754" offset="12403829">If you had workmen in the position of Mr. Buell relegated to state law, then if California allowed intentional infliction of emotional distress but Nevada did not, and you had a situation where a railroad worker was going back and forth between the two states, then you get into some terrible conflicts about it or questions, and it is very, very hard for the railroad to operate, I would think, knowing what it has to counsel its foremen to avoid, just what sort of steps it has to take to see that things don't happen such as happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.106" offset="12525246">So I would think that national uniformity would mean that those state causes of action should be preempted and the FELA should be... allow for actions purely for solely psychiatric injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.133" offset="12585328">If there are no further questions, I would just once again say that it is our position that the FELA, because of the acknowledged humane and humanitarian and remedial aspects of the statute as recognized by this Court speaks to us today simply because the idea that emotional distress was not cognizable in most states in 1908 should not preclude federal courts from being able to recognize the evolving law of torts and if there is any bright line needed between the RLA and the FELA it is fact of injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="3472.197" offset="14037632">Is he really complaining about gastritis or is he really complaining about his foreman's supervision of the workplace?</text>
