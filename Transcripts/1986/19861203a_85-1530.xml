            <text syncTime="73.012" offset="446675">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="76.131" offset="459214">The statute at the center of this case, Section 405 of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982, prohibits an employer in the motor transportation industry from retaliating against an employee who asserts his right to safe working conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.308" offset="519923">The statute authorizes the Secretary of Labor to investigate an employee's complaint that the statute has been violated, and when the Secretary finds reasonable cause to believe that the employer's action violated the statute he must issue a preliminary order directing the reinstatement of the employee and awarding other appropriate relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.471" offset="592543">If the employer objects to the Secretary's order, he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing before an administrative law judge regarding the reasons for the discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.660" offset="629324">The Secretary issues a final decision on the basis of the facts developed at the evidentiary hearing and the Secretary's decision is subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.265" offset="667776">The particular feature of Section 405 that is in dispute here is Congress' determination that employees should be provided with preliminary as well as permanent relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.991" offset="714692">The statute states that an employee must be reinstated on an interim basis if the Secretary finds reasonable cause to believe that his discharge was in violation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.148" offset="759309">This interim reinstatement remains in effect during the subsequent evidentiary hearing and through the resolution of the case on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="167.558" offset="824929">Do you think the statute requires that the reasonable cause investigation be completed within 60 days?</text>

            <text syncTime="221.093" offset="1039028">I was going to mention that, that case, Brock against Pierce County, which involved a similar statutory time limit, which the Court interpreted as directory and non-mandatory.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="231.183" offset="1079361">But there was a good deal of legislative history that supported the Secretary's argument there that that was directed to a different purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.070" offset="1102976">But there's no such history in this case, is there?</text>

            <text syncTime="246.093" offset="1139025">If the time limit was interpreted to divest the Secretary of jurisdiction, then the Secretary's failure to act would cut off the employee's rights, and it couldn't be that Congress intended that a statute that was intended to help employees would fail if the Secretary, because of lack of administrative resources or just the complexity of the particular investigation, wasn't able to complete the investigation within that time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.125" offset="1239231">Congress obviously wanted to protect employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="315.337" offset="1416027">Still, it might be considered a quid pro quo for the employers who are subject to this Act that what's taken away is that they have to reinstate; on the other hand, what they get is a pretty good estimation of whether they're going to have to pay back pay ultimately.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.395" offset="1468272">That is to say, if the Secretary finds against them on that initial determination I expect a lot of employers would simply throw in the towel and reinstate and not be subject to any more back pay liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.953" offset="1518532">And by delaying that for a long time, the Secretary has taken away a lot of the quid pro quo.</text>

            <text syncTime="347.540" offset="1544863">Well, on the other hand, Your Honor, the employers are protected by the thoroughness of the investigation, because the Secretary's determination becomes that much more accurate, and so his reasonable cause finding--</text>

            <text syncTime="365.520" offset="1616752">Just to briefly consider stating the facts in this case, the proceeding began on November 22nd, 1983, when Appellee discharged Jerry Hufstetler, who was one of its truck drivers, on the ground that he had intentionally disabled his truck to obtain extra pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.030" offset="1686760">Hufstetler filed a grievance under his collective bargaining agreement, asserting that he had been discharged in retaliation for his safety activities, and after his grievance was rejected he filed a complaint with the Secretary under Section 405.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.805" offset="1737856">The Secretary conducted his investigation, which took eleven months, and in the course of that investigation Appellee was informed of the charges and the complaint and given an opportunity to present its side of the story.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.930" offset="1782369">The Secretary issued a reasonable cause finding and directed that Hufstetler be reinstated on a temporary basis pending the completion of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.703" offset="1821448">Eleven days after the issuance of the preliminary order, Appellee commenced this action in federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.857" offset="1846107">It sought an injunction against enforcement of the temporary reinstatement order on the ground that the order violated Appellee's due process rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.878" offset="1878186">The district court issued the injunction and held that the due process clause requires the Secretary to hold an evidentiary hearing before issuance of the temporary reinstatement order, and that Section 405 was unconstitutional to the extent that it permitted the issuance of such an order without the prior hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.424" offset="1948403">Now, both sides in this case agree that an employer is entitled to an evidentiary hearing prior to a final determination of the lawfulness of the discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.196" offset="1983511">The only question is whether the hearing must be held before the discharged employee is temporarily reinstated or afterward, and in our view the due process clause as it has been interpreted in this Court's cases does not preclude Congress from authorizing a temporary reinstatement prior to an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.991" offset="2054669">Now, this constitutional question is not new to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.609" offset="2069089">In a line of recent cases, the Court has considered the question of the timing of an evidentiary hearing in connection with an interim or temporary deprivation of liberty.</text>

            <text syncTime="535.946" offset="2298444">Let me add that if there were no reinstatement, obviously if the employer was just required to pay money in the interim, then that payment of money itself would be a loss of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.004" offset="2342747">In this case, since there is reinstatement the employer gets a day's work for a day's pay, and so really the only diminution in his rights is this question of being able to control the workplace, which, as we discuss in our brief, is already subject to quite a lot of federal regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="694.665" offset="2933324">Section 405 is based on what the Court has characterized as the Government's paramount interest in highway safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.901" offset="2958297">When the statute was enacted, Congress had before it evidence of massive noncompliance by the motor transportation industry with the federal safety standards that apply in that area, and Congress concluded that if employees were protected from retaliatory discharges and thus able to act to enforce safety standards that compliance with safety standards would be encouraged.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.351" offset="3052129">And therefore, it adopted Section 405 to provide employees with this protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.940" offset="3078460">And it seems clear that the interim reinstatement protection that's at issue here is essential to Congress' employee protection plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.260" offset="3107717">An employee has to pay his monthly bills for food and shelter on an ongoing basis as they come due, and so an award of back pay several years down the line does not give the employee the protection that he really needs if the protection that Congress designed is to become real.</text>

            <text syncTime="1267.268" offset="5223740">Well, Your Honor, the time limits are directory, and if in a particular case, as in Loudermill, the Court indicated that there was a two-step inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.772" offset="5253729">The first question is whether the scheme that the Government follows provides for an expeditious hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.159" offset="5279329">The second inquiry is whether in the particular case those limits were met and, if they were not met, were they exceeded by such a degree that it amounted to a due process violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.133" offset="5319244">So we think that's the inquiry here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.399" offset="5324259">The Secretary set up a scheme that complies with what the due process clause requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.787" offset="5341813">In a particular case it might be that those time limits might be exceeded and it might be open for an employer to argue that he's been subject to a due process violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.559" offset="5380893">But that doesn't mean that the scheme is invalid, and the only question here is whether the scheme should be upheld and we submit that it should.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.249" offset="5423629">I'd like to briefly discuss another way of looking at the case that we think confirms the constitutionality of what Congress has done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.438" offset="5460409">The interim reinstatement remedy could also be viewed as at accommodation of conflicting interests, similar to preliminary relief in a judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.293" offset="5503877">Here the conflicting interests are the interests of the employer and the interests of the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.816" offset="5529895">On the one hand, the employee has an interest guaranteed by Section 405 in not being discharged in retaliation for safety activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.220" offset="5559570">On the other hand, the employer has an interest in protecting his authority to discharge employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.624" offset="5581200">And in drafting Section 405, Congress had to decide where the interim burden was going to fall in a dispute over the discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.294" offset="5611815">And as I've discussed, the absence of interim relief would threaten the employee with the prolonged loss of his means of livelihood and adversely affect employees' willingness to engage in conduct protected under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.370" offset="5660194">On the other hand, permitting interim reinstatement does not unduly burden employers because they suffer no economic loss in the sense that they get a day's work for a day's pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.476" offset="5696556">So in these circumstances, Congress made a reasonable determination that it was the employer that could best bear the burden of the dispute over the discharge where there has been a showing, based on an investigation, that there was reasonable cause to believe that the discharge was unlawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="2029.827" offset="8274006">And I'd like to speak a moment in response to the question, Your Honor, of what is the property interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.714" offset="8297516">The property interest is significantly more than a simple right to terminate an individual, either the contract right or under the collective bargaining agreement or the common law right to terminate at will if there is no collective bargaining agreement, or perhaps the at-will employment agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.176" offset="8363345">We lose the bargained for arbitration right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.378" offset="8376197">Now, if we were wrong, as the Solicitor General suggests, and the man should have been put back to work, then that can be established in a hearing, a preliminary hearing during the investigative stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.936" offset="8422382">But if the investigator is wrong, we have lost that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.304" offset="8439936">Most importantly is the coerced employment relationship, particularly in the trucking industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.672" offset="8457386">We are being asked to take an individual in whom we have lost all confidence, put him back in a 40 ton piece of equipment out on the open highway, transporting millions of dollars worth of our customers' product and goods, including toxic wastes, chemicals, nuclear wastes, explosives, and general commodities, put him on the highway with our name on the side of the truck as our representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.871" offset="8550173">That's the coerced employment relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="2955.561" offset="11976915">An additional point that I would like to make in connection with the risk of error is the dual role of the investigator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.065" offset="12010979">He functions as both a prosecutor or an agent of the prosecutor and as a decisionmaker or as an advisor of the decisionmaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.104" offset="12055074">The guidelines used by the Secretary of Labor's investigator are the same guidelines used under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, Section 11(c), which is substantially the same as 405 except in the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.763" offset="12105751">It prohibits the same activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.846" offset="12114111">405 was passed simply to extend the 11(c) protection to truck drivers who were covered by DOT and exempt from OSHA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.969" offset="12150578">However, under Section 11(c) once the investigator concludes that there is reasonable cause to believe that the Act has been violated, that is 11(c), the Solicitor goes into federal district court and files suit and the employer gets a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.712" offset="12209510">Using that same procedure, investigative procedure which focuses toward prosecution, the investigator conducts an investigation in which he attempts to resolve credibility issues, resolve fact issues, make a recommendation to his regional supervisor as to whether or not he believes the Act has been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.809" offset="12293938">So we have a situation in which the investigator functions as the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.196" offset="12315462">And I would point out by analogy that this is prohibited under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 554(d), in which the investigator is specifically directed not to participate or advise in the decisionmaking process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3077.821" offset="12465928">There is a substantial risk of error evidenced by the fact that the investigator and then the supervisor and the regional administrator make decision which is contrary to a prior arbitration award which is based on an adversarial hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.914" offset="12522352">That certainly raises significant questions as to whether or not there is error in the investigator and regional administrator's decision if there is reasonable cause when it upsets a prior arbitration award.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.757" offset="12585673">This statute need not, however, be declared unconstitutional by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.126" offset="12603227">The statute is hearing neutral during the investigative stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.529" offset="12616811">There is no provision in the statute which provides that the employer may not have a hearing during the investigative stage and before the order of preliminary reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.718" offset="12653591">There is nothing in the statute that says he must, either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.587" offset="12664981">The court below recognized this and said that the statute is only unconstitutional to the extent that it mandates preliminary reinstatement without a prior evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.626" offset="12709180">This Court in Califano versus Yamasaki recognized that a hearing neutral statute can have read into it a hearing requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.549" offset="12744915">It had a similar fact situation to the extent that the issues to be resolved in the hearing or resolved by the decisionmaker were inherently subjective, were inherently controversial, and therefore an evidentiary hearing was necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3226.334" offset="13060057">A few points, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.453" offset="13072491">I first want to address the question of the information that's available to the employer during the investigatory process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.289" offset="13099867">Although the statute doesn't require it, there is nothing... first of all, there is nothing in the record to indicate what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.926" offset="13122333">But the Department informs us that its practice is to provide employers with the substance of the information that the Secretary is relying on for his reasonable cause finding, so that they have a chance to respond to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.020" offset="13178757">We don't take a position that... so we agree that that information can be provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.090" offset="13207074">With respect to the names of the witnesses, however, we think it's important that those names not be disclosed until the time of testimony, because there is a genuine danger that those people will be intimidated and that they will not testify, and we think that they should be protected until... under the rationale that the Court has used in its FOIA cases, until the time comes when they take the stand, so that the employer won't have an opportunity to tamper with the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.174" offset="13303413">Now, about the question of when the hearing is required, Roadway relies on some other statutes that don't require... that don't have preliminary remedies, for the proposition that there is no need for a prior hearing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.251" offset="13363704">But the Congress has made a different choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.051" offset="13370914">Congress has created a preliminary remedy here, and that's the reason why there's no... that's the reason why this case is different and the reason why this Court's decisions in cases like Loudermill are applicable here, because Congress has made a decision that a hearing should be held afterward, and the due process clause does not invalidate that decision because the employer is provided with notice and an opportunity to respond, a reasonable cause finding, and the subsequent evidentiary hearing.</text>
