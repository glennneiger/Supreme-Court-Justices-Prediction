            <text syncTime="118.327" offset="579095">But to answer your question, Congress amended the statute specifically to overrule the Sixth Circuit's decision in Graham, which held that loan discount fees were not covered by the statute -- in that case involving a kickback.</text>

            <text syncTime="148.279" offset="698945">Since you pay more, that means you borrow less.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.331" offset="715141">So your interest rate is lower, because you borrowed less.</text>

            <text syncTime="169.526" offset="783895">And it did that in order to encompass kickbacks, at the very least, involving loan discount points, which is what was at issue in Graham.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.382" offset="819317">Now, you can have debates -- and we will have in this case eventually -- debates about what does it mean for a loan discount fee to be unearned.</text>

            <text syncTime="243.324" offset="1079079">It's a complicated question that involves interpretation of another provision of the statute that Congress amended to deal specifically with this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.347" offset="1111157">And it wouldn't solve -- it wouldn't resolve the circuit conflict that the Court granted cert to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.149" offset="1130383">And so if I could turn to that, if you look at the language of the statute, which is reproduced on page 6a of the -- the blue brief, in the words of the statute, a lender who charges an unearned fee accepts within the meaning of the statute a portion, split or percentage, i.e., 100 percent, of a charge that was made for the rendering of a covered real estate settlement service other than for services actually performed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1292.331" offset="5275180">You have two sets of verbs in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.866" offset="5285316">One is the "give and accept" set of verbs and then the other is the "charge made or received".</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.704" offset="5312588">So it seems to me that what this statute is thinking about is at first that there's a charge made or received, and that charge is, of course, the charge that the consumer pays to the provider.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.097" offset="5366191">And then there's another transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.697" offset="5372565">And that transaction is the "give or accept" transaction, and that transaction occurs between two service providers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1589.307" offset="6463020">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.325" offset="6475141">In passing RESPA in 1974, Congress was stepping into the middle of a primarily local market controlled by State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.265" offset="6506906">The statute shows that in doing so Congress tread carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.549" offset="6519967">It did primarily two things in the area of settlement charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.018" offset="6533864">First, its major reform was to standardize and increase disclosure of charges, including requiring a written estimate of charges to be given to people weeks before the closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.976" offset="6577750">That in fact was done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.744" offset="6584751">Second, as RESPA's finding and purposes section tells us, Congress found that some consumers needed particular protection from a particular market failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.884" offset="6625397">And I'm quoting from section 2601 in the first page of the blue brief, quote:</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.854" offset="6649221">"Unnecessarily high settlement charges caused by certain abusive practices that have developed in some areas of the country. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.293" offset="6682971">Congress identified those as kickbacks and referral fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.745" offset="6692793">But in 1974, Congress went no farther.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.197" offset="6706586">It rejected proposals for direct price regulation which had been proposed in both House and Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.517" offset="6727902">Congress did recognize more legislation might be necessary and that price controls might be advisable, and so it sent HUD out to do a study and report back.</text>

            <text syncTime="3397.639" offset="13696326">Justice Breyer, you had asked why Congress would engage in a statute that gets at overcharges and there is a rate regulation kind of thing, which is very unusual, and I agree it's unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.278" offset="13742929">That's a reason to read this statute not to do that, to only get at truly unearned fees, which are the equivalent of fraudulent fees, which the law does forbid pervasively.</text>

            <text syncTime="3462.831" offset="13957133">It's on -- it's on 5305.7 and what they are explaining is that -- and they are talking about a third situation and they say one settlement service provider charges a fee to a consumer where no work is done, or the fee exceeds the reasonable value of the services performed by that provider.</text>

            <text syncTime="3496.403" offset="14091402">And that involves the agency in the job of deciding what's a fair or just price for this particular service.</text>

            <text syncTime="3544.749" offset="14284813">It's much more complicated than I thought coming in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.418" offset="14295471">I have to look at a lot of things.</text>

            <text syncTime="3549.853" offset="14305188">Well, Congress said its purpose was, was to get at abusive practices that unnecessarily increase the costs of settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.957" offset="14329639">What -- the legislative history was focused on kickbacks, but there were examples in the HUD/VA report at page 16 of that report and in the Washington Post articles about markups that are a form of undivided, unearned fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.749" offset="14376764">Congress knew subsequent to the passage of this statute, HUD has frequently found and reported to Congress instances of unearned fees, including those involving loan discount fees; and the States -- 21 States have filed a brief in this case tell you that there is a pervasive problem with settlement closings included padded charges for things that were never performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.243" offset="14454818">With respect to the agency's interpretation, I would point you particularly to this 1996 rulemaking where the agency withdrew an exemption for certain payments between consumers and providers for the use of a particular kind of computer service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.520" offset="14515840">That exemption would have been unnecessary had HUD thought, as Quicken does, that the statute only regulates transactions between providers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.592" offset="14548127">And in withdrawing that exemption, HUD explained in quite a lot of detail that it rejected specifically that -- the split fee requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.032" offset="14581982">And so I don't think there is any question that they have grappled with this question and that they have explained why they think that split fees aren't covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.120" offset="14614269">The question ultimately is whether that's a reasonable conclusion in light of this statute--</text>

            <text syncTime="3631.422" offset="14631510">And then part of that is -- you might want to say something about the other part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.224" offset="14646661">I mean the purpose of this kind of APA/Chevron stuff is to prevent agencies saying the supreme importance of their own mission, taking a statute, running with it and in particular transforming into a criminal law something that really wasn't much there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.038" offset="14725969">Now procedure is important in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.573" offset="14736104">And that's why I'm very interested in whether -- whether -- whether they gave notice to the public:</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.643" offset="14760346">"Dear public, we are thinking that this is far more than a kickback statute. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3686.259" offset="14850834">In Long Island Care they did the opposite of what they had proposed to do, and this Court said that was enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.144" offset="14866403">In this case -- and even in 1996, they received comments with respect to the case law that said that only splits are required and they said we disagree.</text>
