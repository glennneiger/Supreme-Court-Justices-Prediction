            <text syncTime="8.759" offset="139452">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.415" offset="150006">If Congress had intended to waive the sovereign immunity of the United States to allow uncapped emotional distress claims under the Privacy Act, it would have and was required to state that waiver clearly and unambiguously in the statutory text.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.956" offset="204236">The substantive requirements of the act sweep far beyond any pre-existing common law protection of privacy to impose a detailed set of new and pervasive requirements on the collection, maintenance, use and dissemination of millions of Federal agency records.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.483" offset="270378">The act, for example, forbids agencies from keeping too much information about an individual, compels agencies to collect information about an individual, when practicable, from the individual himself and not from other sources, and can require agencies to safeguard information about an individual even when that information is otherwise already publicly available.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.269" offset="357522">Congress would not have taken lightly the question of whether to expose the United States to expansive damages for intentional or willful violations of these novel recordkeeping requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.997" offset="400363">Indeed, the way in which the district court believes that the Social Security Administration violated the Privacy Act in this case is something that never would have been actionable at common law and never would have resulted in emotional distress recovery.</text>

          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="86.054" stopTime="150.872">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="86.054" offset="448637">Then maybe Congress shouldn't have passed this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.258" offset="457415">But the injury, the invasion of privacy, that's not something where pecuniary damages are -- are prime if they exist at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.051" offset="512585">I mean, this is -- the -- the tort that this is comparable to is intentional infliction of emotional distress.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.950" offset="544246">The -- the person who is subject to this, to this embarrassment, this humiliation, doesn't have out-of-pocket costs, but is terribly distressed, nervous, anxious, and all the rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.024" offset="620523">The -- the act that the Congress is reaching, the impact of it is of that nature, not -- I mean pecuniary damages, you know, ordinarily attend conduct that embarrasses, humiliates you, causes mental distress.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric J. Feigin</label>
            <text syncTime="150.872" offset="707877">Well, first of all, Justice Ginsburg, I would like to respectfully disagree with the premise of the question that the Privacy Act is comparable to common law invasion of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.132" offset="748941">All the requirements I just described that are under the Privacy Act would not have existed at common law invasion of privacy even though common law invasion of privacy was, as you say, compensable with emotional distress awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.673" offset="799096">In fact, even if we focus just on the disclosure-related provision of the Privacy Act, it itself is much broader than common law invasion of privacy.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="182.030" stopTime="234.118">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="182.030" offset="832533">Even if it is -- even if it is, the damages are -- the damages are not of a pecuniary kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.961" offset="872239">So you could say that Congress was much more generous than the common law was, but the impact on the person who is suing is not going to be out-of-pocket business loss, pecuniary loss; it's going to be the embarrassment, the humiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.986" offset="952383">So it's -- it's -- if Congress wanted to do something about the impact on the person it has given a right, it's not going to do something that has to do with pecuniary damages it's not likely the person in -- in this plaintiff's situation is not likely to suffer.</text>

            <text syncTime="234.118" offset="1040886">Well, first of all, Your Honor, there sometimes are, as there were at common law, pecuniary damages resulting from either violation of the Privacy Act or invasions of privacy; and the government sometimes pays out very large pecuniary judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.426" offset="1098146">But to get to the core of your question about why Congress might not in the Privacy Act have provided an emotional distress award, I think the text of the act demonstrates that Congress thought about the possibility of providing an emotional distress award, but decided not to do that in the initial version of the act that it passed in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.155" offset="1156974">Instead, that version of the act in section 5(c)(2)(B)(iii) assigned to the Privacy Protection Study Commission the task of making a recommendation as to whether the act should later be expanded to provide for general damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.335" offset="1217787">The commission understood its mission to -- was to determine whether the act ought to be expanded to provide for dignitary and reputational harms, such as compensation for emotional distress.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.580" offset="1266688">And the Privacy Commission further understood that the act as it had been enacted provided only for actual damages, which it interpreted as synonymous with special damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="395.828" offset="1687677">But this court in Doe described the adverse effect requirement as simply codifying the Article III standing requirements and made very clear that simply because a plaintiff may have suffered an adverse effect that doesn't mean that the plaintiff suffered actual damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.008" offset="1752461">But Justice Ginsburg--</text>

            <text syncTime="413.291" offset="1757581">I'm a little bit confused by that, because in your brief, the Solicitor General's brief in Doe, it described the earlier version of general damages in the following way -- and I'm quoting from your brief there:</text>
            <text syncTime="427.314" offset="1813692">"The general damages provision in the Senate bill likely derived from the common law of tort of invasion of privacy where general damages may be awarded as. "</text>

            <text syncTime="440.357" offset="1865832">""presumed damages", without proof of harm. "</text>
            <text syncTime="445.040" offset="1884536">So I think there in Doe you argued that general damages presumed injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.992" offset="1916406">But that's very different than, I think, the question Justice Ginsburg was asking you.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.570" offset="1934691">It's -- and I read your brief and your arguments as sort of an -- an assumption that if you suffer nonpecuniary harm, you haven't been injured.</text>

            <text syncTime="473.047" offset="1996549">There is a big difference between presumed damages and proven injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.136" offset="2016925">In Gertz we reference the common law tort as requiring actual proof of injury for emotional distress.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.961" offset="2060288">Most State laws say you have to prove the emotional distress.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.103" offset="2076797">We are not presuming the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.552" offset="2086619">So, I guess what I'm saying to you, aren't you the one confusing what injury is from presumed damage?</text>

            <text syncTime="507.388" offset="2133953">But the -- the -- I think to get at your question, what we said in the Doe brief is that general damages are a type of presumed damages, and that's correct under the common law, but that isn't all that general damages encompasses.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.928" offset="2192154">General damages, as the Court recognized in Doe, are always presumed, in the sense that they are always assumed -- this is the common law definition of general damages -- are always presumed in the sense that they are always assumed to have taken place and an award of general damages can be made even without proof of specific harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.064" offset="2256624">But in cases where a -- at common law, in cases where a plaintiff did introduce evidence of the extent of, for example, the emotional distress that he had suffered.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.543" offset="2298525">So if he wanted to say I am not happy with the presumed damages that you would give to just anybody who had suffered this invasion of privacy, I have a particularly sterling reputation or I am particularly sensitive to this sort of thing, I suffered a -- an increased amount of harm from what you might presume the average person would suffer, The award that that person would receive is--</text>

            <text syncTime="595.992" offset="2488383">Now, to get to your question as to why that is not actual damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.242" offset="2497369">Sometimes the terms "actual damages" or "actual injury" can be used to include proven emotional distress, but the term is ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.079" offset="2536761">We cite cases in footnotes 1 and 2 of our reply brief in which the term "actual damages" or "actual damage" is used to mean exclusively pecuniary harm.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="617.844" offset="2575736">I have looked at those cases and in all of them except for two, where the reference wasn't really precise, it was because the use of "actual damages" in the particular statute were limited to pecuniary harms or the nature of the harms at issue were pecuniary by nature.</text>

            <text syncTime="639.600" offset="2662776">Well, most of those cases are cases out of the common law and sometimes they used "actual damages" in the same sentence with a reference to emotional harm, making clear that they think that the two types of harms are separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.425" offset="2706139">But, Your Honor, maybe I can try to explain it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.735" offset="2719305">I think actually Respondent implicitly agrees with our definition of general damages as including proven harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.093" offset="2740726">If you look at footnote 2 on page 20 of the red brief and then again at page 22 of the red brief, the definition of "actual damages" that Respondent is offering, he divides into two subcategories: Special damages and general damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.662" offset="2807077">Everybody agrees that special damages are limited to pecuniary harm, and Respondent makes no claim, nor could he, that the type of damages he is seeking are special damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.578" offset="2846678">So to the extent he thinks that he is entitled to recovery under the act, it's because he thinks that the emotional distress harm that he wants to prove are general damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.229" offset="2889310">And if there's one thing we know about the definition of "actual damages" in the act, it's that it doesn't include general damages, because again Congress separately in the text of the Privacy Act assigned the Privacy Protection Study Commission to make a recommendation about whether the act should later be expanded to include general damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="735.025" offset="3044477">But the term "actual damages" by itself in a waiver of sovereign immunity is not a clear and unambiguous waiver of the United States' sovereign immunity for claims of emotional distress.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.815" offset="3087632">And as for statutes which do not allow claims against the United States, it would be a question of context and legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.268" offset="3113441">And we would have to do the same kind of workup of the Fair Credit Reporting Act that we have done of the Privacy Act in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="791.142" offset="3268921">If the United States were subject to suit under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, then because there is ambiguity about the meaning of actual damages, we think that the narrower interpretation as limited to pecuniary harm would control.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.855" offset="3311867">One other distinction between the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Privacy Act is again, as I said, the Privacy Act specifically carves out general damages as a type of damages that aren't going to be awarded and the Fair Credit Reporting Act does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.259" offset="3361395">The Fair Credit Reporting Act also has a much more permissive remedial scheme, allowing in certain cases for statutory damages and also allowing for punitive damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1042.864" offset="4275890">And I think one reason there might be that structural similarity is that defamation per quod at common law solves the problem that Congress faced when it was crafting the Privacy Act, which is trying to figure out when a plaintiff's injuries are sufficiently serious and concrete as to justify an award of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.605" offset="4350809">I think it makes sense if, as the Court supposed in Doe, Congress were aware of how defamation per quod had solved that problem, that Congress would have adopted the same limitation, in other words the requirement of showing of pecuniary harm, as the threshold requirement under the Privacy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.299" offset="4409637">Now, Congress had very good reason to be cautious about extending the scope of liability under the Privacy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.830" offset="4435759">As I said, the Privacy Act regulates a great deal of conduct that wouldn't have been compensable at all in common law, let alone resulted in any sort of emotional distress award.</text>

            <text syncTime="1149.816" offset="4703671">--Well, two points on that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.629" offset="4710881">First of all, the reference of the general damages issue to the Privacy Protection Study Commission is in the text of the act that Congress enacted in 1974, so the exclusion of general damages doesn't depend at all on anything the Privacy Protection Study Commission said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.982" offset="4772321">As to the weight we think the Privacy Protection Study Commission report should receive, first of all we think it's very telling evidence that there is at the very least ambiguity about what the term "actual damages" could mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.682" offset="4823103">The Privacy Protection Study Commission interpreted the term "actual damages" in precisely the same way that we do in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.617" offset="4846822">That is, as special damages, as that term was understood in defamation torts at common law, which the Privacy Protection Commission Study report makes very clear at page 530 is limited to pecuniary harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.394" offset="4893947">I think, if for no other reason than that that's a reasonable reading, I think the sort of judicial restraint that is embodied in the canon that requires courts to construe waivers of sovereign immunity narrowly requires this Court to adopt that narrower reading, because it shows that the narrower reading is at the very least a reasonable one or, as the Court said in Nordic Village, is a plausible one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.524" offset="4990495">I -- I think it would have been very unusual for Congress silently or ambiguously to have decided to open the door to emotional distress awards under the Privacy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.971" offset="5032291">As I've said, the Privacy Act is quite a broad, substantive act that would have exposed the government to damages in -- in very new ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.454" offset="5062175">And I think this case illustrates -- illustrates that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.531" offset="5074505">The district court here concluded that the law enforcement-related disclosure of Respondent's medical information by the Social Security Administration was in fact authorized under the Privacy Act by a routine use published in the Federal Register.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.837" offset="5123720">But it concluded that Respondent could nevertheless bring suit against the Federal Government under the Privacy Act because the forms he filled out in seeking Social Security disability benefits didn't adequately disclose to him that his information might be released to other government agencies for law enforcement purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.192" offset="5189130">I don't think there's any reason why Congress would necessarily think that an omission on a government form should give rise to a claim for emotional distress damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.516" offset="5226433">There certainly wouldn't have been any analogue for it at common law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1286.871" offset="5251929">But let's take the worst case, where -- where a government official spreads all kinds of false information, or even true but terribly embarrassing information about a person, does it deliberately.</text>

            <text syncTime="1354.158" offset="5520990">I think the -- you know, looking through the act, which takes up maybe 30 pages of the petition appendix, it clearly isn't simply a codification of common law invasion of privacy against the Federal Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1367.806" offset="5575638">Your Honor, even if we look just at the disclosure-related provision, it's broader than common law invasion of privacy in two very important ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.509" offset="5602388">So for common law invasion of privacy, a plaintiff would have to prove disclosure of very personal and private information to the public at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.833" offset="5639690">Under the Privacy Act, however, a disclosure even to a single person would constitute a violation of the act, and the information doesn't even have to be private.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.221" offset="5673232">Let me give a concrete example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.251" offset="5677411">So if the government has a record that contains information that someone has a criminal conviction, it might be a violation of the Privacy Act for the contents of that record to be disclosed, even though someone could obtain the same information by going to the court records or potentially looking them up on the Internet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.008" offset="5740419">And particularly since violations of Federal law are typically -- typically, the only type of relief a plaintiff can seek for violation of Federal law is equitable relief under the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.788" offset="5779498">I don't think there's any reason to assume that Congress ambiguously, or I think really silently, decided that it was going to ratchet things up to a serious degree and expose the United States to uncapped emotional distress damages under the Privacy Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1450.445" offset="5906139">Well, three points on that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.290" offset="5909588">First of all, I think if Congress had thought that the limitation to intentional or willful conduct was itself a sufficient limitation on the liability of the United States, it wouldn't have been so reluctant to provide for general damages, or perhaps even for punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.581" offset="5970714">Second, the courts of appeals now generally interpret the intentional or willful requirement to require only something slightly less than recklessness or slightly more than gross negligence, which in practice provides district courts and courts of appeals with a great deal of flexibility to find intentional or willful violations in cases where the Federal Government doesn't believe it should be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.259" offset="6057441">Third, to the extent the intentional or willful requirement does impose a limitation on a plaintiff's recovery, what actually winds up happening in practice is that plaintiffs or courts will look to all the various technical provisions of the Privacy Act to try to find some violation that can be classified as intentional or willful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.813" offset="6139674">So for example, if a plaintiff about whom information has been disclosed can't show the disclosure is intentional or willful, he may try to prove that a violation of the -- of (e)(10), which requires the government to safeguard information, was intentional or willful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.668" offset="6195054">With the Court's permission, I would like to reserve the balance of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1554.137" offset="6320964">To carry out the act's protective purposes, this Court need only give the words "actual damages" their common and ordinary meaning that appears in Black's Law Dictionary:</text>

            <text syncTime="1608.064" offset="6536631">If you affirm, there will be a proximate causation question that arises on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.565" offset="6554708">The act requires the damages to be the result of the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.637" offset="6574979">So he cannot recover for the emotional distress that followed from the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.088" offset="6596712">But as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, we're talking today not just about Mr. Cooper; we're talking about every single person to whom this act applies: the whistleblower who the government chooses to silence by embarrassing and humiliating them--</text>

            <text syncTime="1640.519" offset="6666512">But you allege that -- that Mr. Cooper suffered a severe emotional distress when he was confronted with the fact that his records had been turned over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.081" offset="6696709">So you're -- you're saying that the court -- that on remand, there would have to be a separation of the degree of distress that he suffered as a result of simply knowing that somebody in the FAA had access to his Social Security records, but disregard the distress that somebody in that situation would naturally feel when confronted with the fact that a criminal violation that he had committed had been exposed?</text>

            <text syncTime="1675.396" offset="6806006">And that's the kind of thing judges routinely have to sort through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.302" offset="6817604">For example, someone suffers emotional distress and then they lose their job thereafter, and the injury that produces the emotional distress, the job -- the job loss wasn't the proximate cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.640" offset="6866923">Judges -- in fact, we ask juries to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.062" offset="6876641">In this case, it would be a judge sifting through that and making that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.293" offset="6893568">As happened in Petitioner Doe's case, the judge could find that the emotional distress claim wasn't sufficient and reject it altogether, but that's the nature of an emotional distress remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.946" offset="6944141">One thing you didn't hear in that argument almost at all was any discussion of the text of this act, which tells you in at least four separate ways that "actual damages" simply means proven, not presumed, damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.842" offset="7023762">Beginning with the words themselves, that's of course the most common meaning of actual damages, is the one that appears in Black's Law Dictionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.698" offset="7051139">As Justice Sotomayor pointed out, the term of art for economic loss in this arena is "special damages".</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.865" offset="7087815">If that's what Congress meant, presumably it would have used that term, it's the more common way to express one category of damages only that's economic.</text>

            <text syncTime="2692.300" offset="10873584">And this is how I would clarify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.051" offset="10880585">What the doctrine of sovereign immunity requires is that the waiver be expressed in text and the court can't read it in, it can't add words to the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.735" offset="10915380">If you -- if your intent is to separate out presumed liquidated, punitive, other forms of damages that do not -- are not tethered to proof of harm, actual damages is a phrase that does that precisely because that's what actual means; it means real.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.713" offset="10983299">There is no ordinary definition of actual where it means pecuniary only, that is -- you get when you use it in certain contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.130" offset="11020915">So this Court doesn't need to add, expand or read anything into these words "actual damages".</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.143" offset="11048918">It simply needs to give them the meaning that they have in ordinary English definitions, in Black's Law definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.907" offset="11087997">This definition this Court gave to actual damages in the Birdsall case over 100 years ago is the same thing: presumed -- proven damages, not presumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.340" offset="11133764">So the waiver of sovereign immunity is here expressed; it doesn't arise by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.820" offset="11163648">But the one -- but there's another side to the sovereign immunity point that the government never mentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.299" offset="11189561">The court's obligation is dual here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.783" offset="11211504">When there has been a waiver, the court can't expand that waiver, but neither can it contract it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.453" offset="11242224">You have here the government spinning out theoretical -- theoretical possibilities that actual damages was -- was used in this more peculiar sense; what it really meant was special damages -- to produce a deconstruction of the statute that eviscerates it, leaves most of the people who suffer intentional, willful violation without any remedy at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2889.377" offset="11661855">And recall the rule from the Morisette and Molzof case, case when Congress is legislating against a common law background.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.578" offset="11702711">The rule is if Congress's silence is taken as an indication that Congress intends to follow established norms, not depart from them, when Congress says actual damages in a privacy context, it's fair to -- it's going to assume that people are going to understand that at common law, actual damages included emotional distress for privacy violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.380" offset="11809917">So rather than assuming that it departed from the common law, we typically require the contrary direction, under Morisette and Molzof, and we don't have that contrary direction here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.528" offset="11854535">And you get the same answer as you roll through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.777" offset="11875537">You don't need to look -- go past the text, but you get the same answer as you roll through all of the tools of construction: the common law background and the Morisette Molzof Rule points you to the same place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.536" offset="11926528">The legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.613" offset="11938858">This act, the act that emerged, was a compromise between a far broader remedial scheme that authorized punitive damages, did not have the intentional and willful requirement, had a negligence standard, and a more measured version.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.997" offset="12008344">The government's construction of this act throws that compromise out of the window and rewrites the act as a one-sided in the government's favor when what clearly happened in the legislature was that a balance was struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.399" offset="12061947">Another thing about the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.990" offset="12076366">Both the House and Senate bills originally had the term "actual damages" in there from the start, and they both had "actual damages" simply as a counterpart to punitive damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="3347.186" offset="13493144">I just have a few points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.918" offset="13500040">First of all, Respondent would like the Court look -- would like the Court to look to, quote, "the common and ordinary meaning" of actual damages, and asserts that the term "actual damages" fits exactly here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.960" offset="13548210">But no court to consider this issue has ever thought that the meaning of actual damages was plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.098" offset="13572765">You have to look at the context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.693" offset="13579139">And the context here includes the exclusion of general damages, which I think Respondent conceded when Justice Alito asked him this question -- includes--</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="3376.628" offset="13610904">Counsel, you seem to be arguing throughout that general damages meant actual damages, when general damages, in my understanding, meant two things: presumed and actual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.997" offset="13660432">So why is it illogical for Congress to look at what general damages meant, and pick the meaning that included proven damages, actual?</text>

          <turn speaker="eric_j_feigin" startTime="3402.895" stopTime="3441.976">
            <label>Mr. Eric J. Feigin</label>
            <text syncTime="3402.895" offset="13716020">--Well, Your Honor, I think if you look at the sources cited in our brief, as well as the sources cited in his brief -- in particular, I'd refer you to the block quote on page 22, "general damages", that term, most typically refers to a class or a type of damages that could be presumed but could also be proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.874" offset="13791880">And when they are proven -- and I think Respondent effectively conceded this -- they remain general damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.795" offset="13811628">And because Congress decided to think about general damages later, because that would have been such a great expansion of the waiver of sovereign immunity, I don't think the act should be construed to allow those type of emotional distress damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.603" offset="13858858">Now, Respondent would like to--</text>

            <text syncTime="3441.976" offset="13872337">I'm still confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.692" offset="13879129">General damages meant presumed or actual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.507" offset="13882472">Congress says we don't want general damages because it includes presumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.394" offset="13909953">So we are going to use the word "actual".</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.378" offset="13917895">How do you get from that that Congress meant "only pecuniary"?</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.670" offset="13939106">I mean, that has its -- why didn't they just use that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.218" offset="13953317">Instead of "actual damages", why didn't they just say "pecuniary damages", if that's what they intended?</text>

            <text syncTime="3470.072" offset="13984664">--Your Honor, I think that's essentially Respondent's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.805" offset="13995635">He wants to fault Congress for not using the specific term "special damages".</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.444" offset="14010159">But I think that flips the canon of interpreting waivers of sovereign immunity on its head, and requires Congress to unambiguously not waive its sovereign immunity, when in fact, what I think the Court does is precisely the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.395" offset="14061986">I also think, Justice Breyer, addressing the Privacy Protection Study Commission, the commission included two of the Congressmen who sponsored the Privacy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.248" offset="14093437">It agreed with our reading, the reading that we are offering here, of what both actual damages mean and what general damages mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.934" offset="14124157">And -- and not only do they agree with that, but there is a statement in the legislative history that adopts our definition, too, that's discussed in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.318" offset="14157699">Now, I think what Respondent essentially wants the Court to do here is to adopt the recommendation of the Privacy Protection Study Commission that the act be expanded to allow both special and general damages, in which case, emotional distress awards would be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.516" offset="14214437">Now, there may be some good policy arguments for that, as the Privacy Protection Study Commission said, but the judicial restraint that is embodied in the sovereign immunity canon I think compels the Court not to get out ahead of Congress on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.448" offset="14262188">Congress didn't provide emotional distress awards when it passed the act in 1974, it never amended the act to include them, and the act does not provide for them.</text>
