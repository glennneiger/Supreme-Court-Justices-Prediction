            <text syncTime="32.202" offset="234203">California has enacted its own set of rules regarding nonambulatory animals, rules which were intended to be and are different than and in addition to the Federal rules regarding the handling of nonambulatory animals.</text>

            <text syncTime="93.860" offset="480904">Well, Justice Kagan I -- because the scope of the FMIA starts at the gate of the slaughterhouse and ends with sale, California I think could regulate and not -- not have its regulation be expressly preempted if it attempted to prevent purchase before the purchase occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="993.435" offset="4079114">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="995.971" offset="4089354">I haven't heard any quarrel this morning with the proposition that if an animal goes down, say, as it's entering the abattoir to be slaughtered, that the State cannot at that point tell the slaughterhouse how it is to handle that animal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.379" offset="4138987">But that is not any different, of course, than the situation where a pig goes down as it's coming off the truck, or it presents as nonambulatory when the gates of the truck are open, because it's still an operational consideration; the same humane handling requirements still apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.204" offset="4198233">It's still a State requirement and it's not -- it's still different from the Federal requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.775" offset="4220489">So the Court's questions this morning I think have gone to kind of the situations at the margins, at the extreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.512" offset="4247448">So let me try to -- try to address some of those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.083" offset="4265733">The -- the question about whether -- the question about the purchase of the nonambulatory animal and the regulation, the regulation there, the first thing is, as a practical matter, I think you have to think about it in a concrete situation, which is that there is a nonambulatory animal that's on the slaughterhouse premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.198" offset="4362177">That's the hypothetical that we are in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.614" offset="4367924">And the question is what is the slaughterhouse employee to do with that animal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.150" offset="4382030">And the State law says well, you can't buy it, you can't hold it, you can't receive it, you can't turn it into meat, and you have to immediately euthanize it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1075.637" offset="4407944">Well, before you get to that point, the animal has to be transported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.189" offset="4418184">Does Federal law regulate for humane purposes the transportation of animals to slaughterhouses?</text>

            <label>Mr. Benjamin J. Horwich</label>
            <text syncTime="1085.027" offset="4445560">There are Federal laws regarding transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.313" offset="4458621">The Federal Meat Inspection Act has not been interpreted by the secretary to apply specifically to trucks that are in transit, although I should say that the secretary has, for example, interpreted the FMIA -- and this is in Part 309.1(b) to apply, at least to the extent of humane handling, to pens at stockyards that are committed exclusively to a slaughterhouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.547" offset="4567604">And I think if there were a situation such as I think, Justice Kagan, your hypothetical envisioned, where a State determined that it wanted to essentially assert an inspection jurisdiction over animals that were in transit to a slaughterhouse, so essentially between the pen and the slaughterhouse, the secretary might well recognize that -- that his authority needs to extend, needs to extend to those, because the purpose of the act, after all, is to set a Federal inspection standard for animals to determine if they are suitable to be turned into meat.</text>

            <text syncTime="1150.287" offset="4706576">Well, if the Federal -- if Congress has not chosen to regulate the transportation of animals to prevent inhumane treatment in transit, why should a State law that aims at that objective be preempted?</text>

            <text syncTime="1173.300" offset="4798631">But of course the injunction that I understand Petitioners to be seeking is not one that goes to State regulation of trucks, but rather to State regulation of animals that are on the slaughterhouse premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.025" offset="4845547">And the secretary has made unmistakably clear that the scope of the FMIA is at least as large as the official slaughter establishment's premises.</text>

            <text syncTime="1253.537" offset="5119519">I mean, State laws of general applicability would, to the extent they don't in some particular application introduce into the scope of the FMIA, they would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.227" offset="5154314">And I also want to be very clear, so that there's no mistaking the government's position: State prosecutions for animal cruelty are not preempted to the extent they are prosecuting conduct that is unlawful under Federal law, because that is -- that is an example of a State that is not applying a different or an additional standard of conduct, but simply adding -- applying its own sanction for conduct that Federal law would similarly sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.144" offset="5262043">So there is absolutely room for State, the application of State law on the premises of the slaughterhouse.</text>

            <text syncTime="1293.912" offset="5281061">In that respect, do State inspectors routinely go on the premises of slaughterhouses to ensure that their coextensive laws are properly enforced?</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.970" offset="5329335">And if that's so, are there problems of judgment, that a Federal inspector says, no, this is okay under Federal law and the State official says, no, this is not okay under the State law, even though they say the same thing?</text>

            <text syncTime="1318.730" offset="5380326">I'm -- I am not aware that in general State inspectors or other State officials would go to the Federally inspected premises as a general matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.537" offset="5427555">But let's assume for the sake of argument that they were and then your question -- excuse me -- presents the question about these sort of differences in judgment that might be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.643" offset="5467993">The Federal regulations generally provide that the disposition made by veterinarians, by Federal veterinarians, is the conclusive judgment of the secretary as to the fitness of the animal for turning into meat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.403" offset="5523059">And so in that situation, the State official would not be able to reach a different judgment on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.973" offset="5549286">And so I -- so I think that would resolve any situation where State officials were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.544" offset="5575617">Of course, the situation where State officials do inspections is the one that the act itself envisions and that California has not taken the opportunity to implement, which is for intrastate-only plants States can enact their own inspection regulations and have their own inspectors there as long as they are following Federal standards at a minimum.</text>

            <text syncTime="1419.926" offset="5785119">The answer to your question is this case comes here on preliminary injunction, so I think the Court could appropriately articulate its answer and its understanding of the different provisions, and that probably would then lead to the lower courts working out the particulars of the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.903" offset="5857008">But let me actually make a point in that regard about what the injunction might or might not look like with respect to the buying provision, which is that I don't understand the State to have some free-floating interest in when title or does not pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.997" offset="5913433">The State is interested in regulating what animals can be purchased because of a background principle of State law that I assume exists, that slaughterhouses can't slaughter things they don't own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.769" offset="5952512">And if you put those two pieces together, the ban on buying is nothing, is nothing but doing in two steps what the State clearly can't do in one step, which is tell slaughterhouses how they are to deal with an animal that is on their premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.411" offset="6003085">At least they can't -- States can't tell slaughterhouses how to do that when there is a Federal regulation on the subject.</text>

            <text syncTime="3349.021" offset="13501482">--Well, not necessarily, because the law -- if we look at the entire California penal code section it's dealing not just with slaughterhouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.477" offset="13535336">So it is trying to deal with a comprehensive problem that it sees with respect to nonambulatory animals, not just at the slaughterhouse but at other market agencies, etcetera -- and livestock agencies and so -- so the focus on purchasing, buying, receipt, selling of the meat is to prohibit and -- and stop the -- the commerce in nonambulatory animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.611" offset="13643901">And -- and California's purpose there as I said was twofold, to one, protect general public health but also to prohibit animal cruelty in an area where -- where California legislators were concerned about the humane treatment of nonambulatory animals, not -- not just swine because the law is broader than that, but that's what's at issue here today.</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven J. Wells</label>
            <text syncTime="3432.525" offset="13835536">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.275" offset="13838566">I just have a couple of quick points to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.061" offset="13845671">One is that the Secretary has interpreted the -- section 602 and section 603 and section 604 to require that all animals be handled, all animals on the premises be handled humanely and that all animals be subject to the regulations under the chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.208" offset="13930203">That's set forth in 9 CFR 302.3 and it's also set forth in the Secretary's directives, it's directive 6100 at appendix at 47.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.865" offset="13972835">So the Secretary does not make a distinction in implementing section 602 through 604 between animals that the State may choose to try to categorically remove.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.156" offset="14018079">It applies to all animals, and that is critical because a State -- a slaughterhouse worker who is on the premises needs to have one set of rules that the worker follows so that the worker knows that if he follows the advice of a Federal inspector and, for example, puts a nonambulatory animal -- separates the animal, put -- puts it in a covered pen and it -- lets it go through the ante-mortem inspection that it's required to have under Federal law, that the slaughterhouse worker won't go to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.307" offset="14126644">And that's why it's critical that -- to Congress -- that was critical to Congress that we had this uniformity and I think it's critical that this Court find preemption on this case, because otherwise Federal law will appear and disappear, apparently based on when the State believes that it's removing animals from -- in connection with slaughter, whenever that would occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.721" offset="14208355">Just one other point and that is, it is also crystal clear that the Human Methods of Slaughter Act of 1978 incorporated the standards of humane treatment that were included in the Human Methods of Slaughter Act of 1958, and it isn't just the preamble to that public law that indicates that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.848" offset="14284842">Those requirements are found now in 21 U.S.C. section 603(b) and they are backed up by prohibitions which are backed up by criminal penalties in section -- in 21 U.S.C. section 610 -- yes, 610(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.060" offset="14357671">And if the Court has no more questions, I'll conclude my remarks.</text>
