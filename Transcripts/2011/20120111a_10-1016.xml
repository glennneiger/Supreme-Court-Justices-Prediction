            <text syncTime="13.103" offset="156797">The propriety of any section 5 legislation is judged by in reference to the historical perspective that it reflects, and that historical perspective is very clear in -- and it's set very clearly by Congress and by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.299" offset="225552">It -- it is an unfortunate, long history of State-Sponsored gender discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.624" offset="258884">And that discrimination embodies gender-based stereotypes that took a very firm hold in the employment area, where women had difficulty obtaining employment and holding employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.541" offset="318548">And this Court in a litany of cases recognized these gender-based stereotypes as an improper assumption about women's abilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.067" offset="368703">In Frontiero v. Richardson, it rejected this issue that women's mission were to be women -- to be wives and mothers; Stanton v. Stanton, that women were to be the homemaker and men the breadwinner, and--</text>

            <text syncTime="88.164" offset="457101">Well, Mr. Foreman, I -- I guess the question in this case is what this particular statutory provision has to do with gender discrimination and the history of gender discrimination: Whether Congress was aiming to eradicate gender discrimination through this provision, or whether it was trying to do something else entirely.</text>

            <text syncTime="110.096" offset="544768">--And -- and it was directly attempting to address these gender-based stereotypes in a couple different ways as a practical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.714" offset="587295">At that time, when an employer saw a woman, they didn't necessarily just see a worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.461" offset="622195">They-saw a person that could become pregnant, and worked on these gender-based stereotypes, that that woman would either become pregnant, would be disabled because of pregnancy-related disabilities, but in any event was a least -- least attractive employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.313" offset="701607">And the Family and Medical Leave Act addresses that specifically in its purposes section.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.996" offset="732432">It specifically says that it is intended</text>
            <text syncTime="159.810" offset="743612">"to promote the equal opportunity for women and men pursuant to the Equal Protection Clause. "</text>
            <text syncTime="166.104" offset="768794">But more specific to the self-care provision, Congress made it very clear what they were trying -- attempting to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.840" offset="899720">That's the negative inference argument that we make in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.087" offset="924693">But even more to the point, if you move to the purpose sections at appendix 2, page -- appendix 2, it specifically is intended to minimize the potential for employment discrimination on the basis of sex by ensuring generally that leave is available for eligible medical reasons, including maternity-related disabilities, and for compelling family reasons, and ensure equal protection under the law--</text>

            <text syncTime="260.472" offset="1146316">I -- I just don't see how that would affect the incentives of -- of an employer in that situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.757" offset="1263449">So we're just dealing with (D), which concerns a serious health condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.647" offset="1274943">So you have an employer who is willing to discriminate on the basis of gender, and the employer has two applicants for employment, a man and a woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.672" offset="1319037">And the employer says, well, if I hire the man, he might take 12 weeks of leave for a serious medical condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.168" offset="1353101">And if I hire the woman, she might take 12 weeks of leave for a serious medical condition which might be something that either men or women could get, or it also could be a sickness related to pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.786" offset="1403570">So, there still is -- there still would be an incentive for this hypothetical employer to discriminate against the woman.</text>

            <text syncTime="344.308" offset="1481624">I just don't understand how giving both men and women 12 weeks for self-care affects the incentive.</text>

            <text syncTime="499.129" offset="2100935">Mr. Foreman, I think everyone has been trying to get you to focus on the health care sickness leave alone, and in the -- in the portions of the act that this Court upheld, the Congress said there is this close association of women with children; we think it's going to be good for everybody if fathers recognize their responsibility for elderly parents, sick children, sick spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.921" offset="2240115">So, we -- we can see the rationale for trying to change the stereotype, trying to open up care-giving for both sexes.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.906" offset="2284001">But you have answered the question that women and men get sick; there's no -- there's no disproportion.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.369" offset="2333842">So how do you tie that, just that part of the act, where there isn't the obvious association of women with childbearing?</text>
            <text syncTime="571.298" offset="2389640">So we extend the benefit to men, so they will be associated with child care.</text>

            <text syncTime="603.926" offset="2520148">You are saying that the -- that Congress is thinking that an employer actually does think that women take more sick leave because women get pregnant.</text>

            <text syncTime="628.865" offset="2619831">And in response to Justice Alito's question -- and I'm sorry if I gave a confusing response.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.288" offset="2645535">There are two separate ways of addressing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.520" offset="2658492">You can look at self-care as a stand-alone provision, without (A), (B), and (C), Congress passed just self-care.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.967" offset="2692242">In that case it would be responding to exactly that type of gender stereotype, and 12 weeks would be a congruent proportional response.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.400" offset="2729963">The other way to look at it is that's not the way Congress passed the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.100" offset="2752846">They passed it as a comprehensive response with (A), (B) and (C), and hence (D) then becomes a bit of an equalizer to take away this negative incentive that only women would take (A), (B), and (C).</text>
            <text syncTime="676.486" offset="2810316">So there's two separate ways that this Court can get to the same conclusion, and that conclusion is that this is a congruent and proportional response to gender-based discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1645.968" offset="6688246">I took from Mr. Foreman something that I hadn't understood from his briefs -- maybe because I just missed it -- which is that he's making a kind of analogous argument, that, just as in the prior provisions of the act, employers thought of women as caregivers and the response of Congress was to provide a gender-neutral leave benefit that had both -- that both women and men were eligible for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.925" offset="6804125">So here, employers think of women as needing more medical leave because of pregnancy, and the response of Congress is to provide gender-neutral sick leave.</text>

            <text syncTime="1688.952" offset="6860236">--Congress, Justice Kagan, did not I think take that stereotype or perception that Mr. Foreman referred to into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.975" offset="6912272">And I'd specifically point the Court to page 21 of our brief, where we cite some Bureau of Labor Statistics studies indicating that men and women at the time took roughly the same amount of sick leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.031" offset="6984474">In fact, Mr. Foreman has conceded as much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.406" offset="6993983">And that same study projects that men and women will take roughly the same amount of time after the enactment of the FMLA--</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="1735.041" offset="7044556">But, there certainly was -- there was certainly much conversation and testimony that, whether they in fact took the same amount of leave time or not, that women who were pregnant or were perceived as capable of getting pregnant were hired less frequently because subjectively the employers thought that they were more likely to take the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.593" offset="7138806">So, frankly, for years there was questions about whether law firms were hiring young -- not hiring young women because they feared they would leave in the middle of a big case or something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.915" offset="7200037">We all know those stories, so it is sort of common knowledge in many ways, but there was plenty of testimony related to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.383" offset="7225950">So assume that that was Congress's perception, because it was supported by the record or as much of the record as Hibbs recognized as adequate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1792.721" offset="7275269">--Well, I would make a couple of points in response to that, Justice Sotomayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.095" offset="7296794">First, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act was already in place, and so to the extent there were perceptions that employers might discriminate based on pregnancy disabilities, that would be unlawful under Title VII as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.238" offset="7401388">And the fact that -- and you are quite right that there is a fair amount of discussion in the legislative record, although I think it's less of a predominant theme than the concern for job security for working families, but there certainly is discussion about pregnancy discrimination and pregnancy disability as a type of illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.990" offset="7532314">But, we again would note that this is valid Commerce Clause legislation, and so to the extent that kind of discrimination was occurring, and leave was being denied or women were suffering adverse consequences in the workplace as a result of pregnancy discrimination, they could enforce the 12 weeks through a Title &lt;VII&gt; [= VII] action.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="1888.135" offset="7656970">They couldn't -- the Pregnancy Discrimination Act says you have to treat pregnancy like any other disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.461" offset="7690198">So if they are not giving anybody any leave for anything, they don't have to give any leave; not 12 weeks, not 1 day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.410" offset="7717992">And that's what -- that's the gap that this legislation fills, essentially.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.908" offset="7747981">Yes, you do have to provide leave for women who have disabling conditions, including pregnancy, but then you have to give that to the men as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.151" offset="7809003">You can't reserve that for the one sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.980" offset="7816317">So it was the gap in the Pregnancy Discrimination Act that this -- this was referring to.</text>

            <text syncTime="1942.959" offset="7876190">But the gap that existed was the absence of a guaranteed period of leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.420" offset="7910045">In other words, it was the absence of the substantive entitlement to a certain amount of leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.339" offset="7941705">And in effect the gap that was being filled served as prophylaxis for Title VII, but not for constitutional violations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1975.597" offset="8006802">Assume for the sake of argument that for the applicants for particular provisions -- particular positions, I should say -- where the applicants are typically of a certain age, men tend to take less sick leave than women, because women also take sick leave for pregnancy-related illnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.228" offset="8121323">So giving everybody 12 weeks eliminates the possibility that women who will be taking -- want to take additional -- want to take more sick leave will be fired because they exceed the amount of sick leave allowed by the employer for everybody.</text>

            <text syncTime="2053.097" offset="8316824">I think that the principal reason why employers do view potential hires as -- when they are women, as likely to take a lot of time off, I think goes more to the family caretaking provisions, and I think that is largely reflected in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="2152.912" offset="8716079">One, the easiest, is in (D) itself, sometimes a woman could have a miscarriage and of course she has to stay home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.799" offset="8751606">And that isn't covered by (A), (B), or (C), so we cover it in (D), you know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.519" offset="8766443">And then we put the men in too because we don't want to make this incentive just to not hire women.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.391" offset="8793924">That's one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.937" offset="8796118">The second one was the one Justice Ginsburg brought up, that there is a gap in the pregnancy law which won't work unless you have to give people some medical leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.025" offset="8836451">So here it is, (D).</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.850" offset="8843766">And the third one, which I think was related to what Justice Alito just said, is when -- you have to read it together to understand the third one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.062" offset="8876680">You get weeks altogether, all right?</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.779" offset="8891517">Now, that means once you put in (D) this act will have less of a bad effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.587" offset="8930701">The bad effect of the act is if you protect the women then the employers say, well, we're not going to hire women, perfect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.117" offset="8956824">We have to give them 12 leaves, we'd have to give the men -- terrible, it's a terrible disincentive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.069" offset="8968631">But then they worked out how to lessen the disincentive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.238" offset="8985349">And the way you do that, you say 12 weeks overall.</text>

            <text syncTime="2378.949" offset="9620229">I think that's what Justice Breyer was getting at.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.354" offset="9629842">But just suppose that Congress wanted to improve conditions for the -- in the job market for women, which I think it's fair to say was the motivating force behind this act, and they also wanted to protect families so that sick children, sick spouses are attended to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.903" offset="9736004">Now, what leave policy would say, okay, to do that we will have leave when a spouse is sick, a child is sick, a parent is sick, but not when the worker herself is sick?</text>

            <text syncTime="2510.877" offset="10147903">But if we look at what Congress was trying to do, they were trying to do it as a whole.</text>

            <text syncTime="2518.953" offset="10180190">And they are trying to do it as a whole because, no matter what numbers I use, if I look at it without (D) -- is it (D)?</text>

            <text syncTime="2533.791" offset="10239540">And if I look at it with (D), suddenly the ratio from the point of view of the employer of the disadvantage of hiring a woman over -- over hiring a man, it goes way down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.723" offset="10287292">And that helps women.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.769" offset="10299517">And that is why I think, reading this and listening, a major reason why they put in (D) as part of the other, because working with that 12-week limitation, and the whole rest of the statute, we now have a statute that doesn't defeat itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.137" offset="10368899">We now have a statute that actually can achieve the end of leading employers to not discriminate against women.</text>

            <text syncTime="2639.327" offset="10661679">Now, those could be taken advantage of by either men and women.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.496" offset="10678397">It makes both men and women increasingly unattractive as employees and therefore reduces any special disincentive that might have been created by (A), (B), and (C).</text>

            <text syncTime="2986.933" offset="12052125">But when you look at (D) as passed at the same moment on the basis of the same record as (A), (B), and (C), with the overwhelming purpose of Congress being to protect women from discrimination in the workplace because of unfair stereotypical gender -- views about what women do as workers, then (D) assumes a different kind of aura.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.218" offset="12161317">And you can talk about a-number of theories for that, but I guess I would just ask for your reaction to that, that (D) is just part of a package which was about telling employers, get rid of your old stereotypes, don't act on your old stereotypes, employ women.</text>

            <text syncTime="3107.229" offset="12533300">So I would really emphasize, in response to your question, that one could look at it as a package, but from the standpoint of States it's a separate and independent claim and it's an extraordinarily broad one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.814" offset="12607697">And it is not necessary, not simply because Pregnancy Discrimination Act claims are available, but, Justice Alito, there are Ex parte Young claims available.</text>
