            <text syncTime="1922.994" offset="7797768">And what everybody understood was that if that were the case, if the new guidelines and the old mandatory minimums sort of -- both applied together, it would lead to ridiculous disparities in the way people were sentenced.</text>

            <text syncTime="1949.061" offset="7902049">I think, you know, one of the fundamental points here is that a premise of the law is to treat like people alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.233" offset="7934754">And people who committed the same offense on the same date and may have done so with each other we would expect to get comparable punishment if they were comparable situated as to criminal history, and the -- that the solution that's being urged undermines that even though that is exactly what section 109 says.</text>

            <text syncTime="1983.634" offset="8040289">But the point about the guidelines and statute working together, wasn't there a time when the Sentencing Guidelines -- they wanted to do away with this distinction and Congress said, no, Sentencing Commission, you can't do it, you can't do it to the guidelines when we don't do it to the statute?</text>

            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="2006.500" offset="8131822">There are two points about the guidelines that I think we have to keep in mind, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.202" offset="8150630">The first one is that they are guidelines, especially in the world after Booker, which is the world that confronted Congress in 2010.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.842" offset="8189187">They are guides that must be considered by the judge to inform judicial discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.294" offset="8211025">So in the nature of the guidelines there is nothing inherent in saying that we must have new ones that also implies a new obligation of statutory law to people whose offense conduct occurred earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.387" offset="8259404">The second aspect of it is that it has been part of the nature of a guidelines system for two decades that it has been consistent with the decision by Congress in some areas to constrain the exercise of discretion with mandatory minimums.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.879" offset="8313320">And this Court has recognized that in multiple occasions in Kimbrough, in Neal, in DePierre, any number of cases, and the guidelines themselves in section 5G1 recognize that the mandatory minimum may trump a lower guideline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.506" offset="8383851">So when you have a long history in 2010 of rulings from this Court acknowledging, as you said in your opinion in Kimbrough, that this may lead to cliffs, et cetera, and you also have a recognition by the Commission itself that they have to integrate this reality of sentencing law into their own guidelines, there is very little basis for an inference that Congress in providing new guidelines would have contemplated that the effective date of the law would change--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="2098.925" offset="8501507">But Congress did say: Sentencing Commission, you conform your new guidelines to applicable law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.365" offset="8535257">The applicable law has got to be the new law, because if it were the old law, there is nothing to conform.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.137" offset="8566395">There is nothing that they need to change.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.687" offset="8572560">It's only that this section (a)(2) makes sense only if the applicable law is the new law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.779" offset="8616968">Otherwise the Commission doesn't have to do anything to achieve consistency.</text>

            <text syncTime="2144.490" offset="8683737">The question is cui bono: For whose benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.292" offset="8698992">And Congress clearly contemplated for some of the reasons that you outlined that the system in the change in the statute would not do any good for people coming to be sentenced 6 months later if they still had higher guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.952" offset="8757611">But much has been said here today about the 90-day window.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.070" offset="8774120">The 90-day window is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.189" offset="8778509">The really relevant window is the comparison of what the new guidelines would have been and when they would have come out absent the emergency authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.395" offset="8823335">Absent any emergency authority, new guidelines would have come out November 1, 2011, which would have been a good 15 months after the passage of the FSA.</text>

            <text syncTime="2935.221" offset="11846643">So that, henceforth, I guess the Commission has to conform to the 18-to-1 ratio, and it would no longer be open to the Commission, for example, to do what it did in 2007, which is we changed our mind; there's a mandatory minimum that constrains us, but in light of the most recent scholarship, we think the ratio should be 16 to 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.398" offset="11911427">And -- and one of the reasons why I am reluctant to urge you to accept, you know, the government's construction, which I can see how they would be helped by in future cases, is that I think it's very implausible for Congress to have considered this, as they say, the centerpiece of the statute and have -- have it be the last depending clause of section 8.</text>

            <text syncTime="3093.792" offset="12481000">And so whereas there are mandatory minima that are troublesome and give rise to cliffs, there are also occasions in which the Commission is able to do things that are not consistent with the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3484.495" offset="14043750">Justice Kagan, it is not happening in that manner, because the guidelines, every book of the guidelines, I believe since 1987, which is the first one, has had, like, 5G1.1, which says these are the guidelines, but 5G tells you if a mandatory minimum applies, for whatever reason, you apply that and that becomes the mandatory sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.474" offset="14127655">And so there has never been any reason to have two sets of guidelines to account for cliffs or andatory minimums, because every guidelines book has had a built-in solution to that problem, which is we understand that there are cliffs, we understand that there is a world of mandatory minimums; we can't fix those, this is our guideline sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.238" offset="14210725">If somehow, for some reason -- because it occurred, you know, before or whatever -- there is a mandatory minimum that applies, the guidelines say the mandatory minimum becomes the guideline sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.279" offset="14258894">So in that sense, a Congress that knew the law would understand that saying you have to have new guidelines had no logical force in saying that therefore the effective date of mandatory minimums or any other factor that bore on the application of mandatory minimums would be changed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3563.513" offset="14359832">Obviously this Court recognizes the difficulty of those district court judges sitting and asking themselves: What do I do with this defendant as opposed to another defendant?</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.337" offset="14411136">And after listening to my colleague, Mr. Estrada, I still have to ask the Court to consider the question that the Court has been asking: What possible reason could Congress have to want a district court judge to have to sit back 5 years after the date of enactment of the Fair Sentencing Act and impose mandatory minimums that everyone agrees at this point are racially discriminatory?</text>

            <text syncTime="3606.524" offset="14531926">I mean, that's what section 109 says: Even though we have decided that this old law is bad and the penalty should be lesser, even though we have decided, when we do that you continue to apply the bad old penalty to people who committed a crime before the amendment.</text>
