            <text syncTime="641.613" offset="2671846">I mean, my simple question really is you are a drafter, imagine you are a drafter, and you are charged with drafting section 43.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.469" offset="2703297">And you read -- try to get the fraud and deceit crimes, okay?</text>
            <text syncTime="654.170" offset="2722105">So now we read 76 -- 7206(1) and (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="659.158" offset="2742063">And you see for both of those you can't be convicted unless you materially and willfully make a false statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.328" offset="2770693">So you think, hey, I don't need a special section on that one.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.264" offset="2782501">But then you go to 7201, and you say, oh, my God, I just thought, somebody might violate this by going off to some special country, taking all his assets and writing ha-ha-ha.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.238" offset="2822416">Now there is no fraud or deceit in that.</text>

            <text syncTime="689.778" offset="2864525">--What's wrong with it, Your Honor, is that what we're talking about is the aggravated felony statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.466" offset="2903291">And the issue -- and it may be a narrow one for this Court -- is whether the conviction under 7206, which does not require anything more than filing of a false statement without any intent to deceive or defraud -- whether that is an aggravated felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.415" offset="3003079">And this Court has said time and again that it's the elements of the offense that determines aggravated felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.188" offset="3038187">If I may illustrate the point, if -- if a conviction under 7206 was viewed by this Court as including fraud and deceit for the reasons many of the justices have indicated, that, you know, that when somebody writes a false tax return, it's got to be deceit, what that does is that would collaterally estop a taxpayer from denying fraud and deceit in the civil collection action.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.966" offset="3209237">So this is what Commissioner Walters was concerned about, why he has filed his brief, that it in effect would undermine the ability of the government to get an easy conviction based simply on a false statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.880" offset="3292933">Similarly, if you are convicted of tax evasion, the -- the tax evader cannot challenge fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.271" offset="3338491">He is collaterally estopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.438" offset="3347163">And as we know, when the government goes to seek recovery, that is getting the taxes back in a civil proceeding, there is no statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.613" offset="3415918">The intention of Congress is also reflected in the Internal Revenue Code section 6501, where if a person is convicted under 7206 and the government seeks to collect the unpaid taxes in an assessment proceeding, Congress particularly said that where there is a conviction under 7206, the government has the burden of proving fraud, which seems to me to be evidence -- or rather, the government has the -- a duty to prove there was an attempt to evade the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.082" offset="3625733">But the conclusion is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.700" offset="3636182">If Congress had intended that proof of fraud and deceit would be in 7206, there would be no reason at all for congress to put that in 70 -- 6501.</text>

            <text syncTime="1486.849" offset="6052822">I'd also note that it is not at all clear that in the context of the evasion of payment cases that I was just discussing in the context of tax evasion, that the same civil tax fraud penalty would be applicable there, because the civil tax fraud penalty is triggered by an understatement of an amount required to be shown on the return.</text>

            <text syncTime="2953.739" offset="11920342">So here, there is a different phrase, but I think what's important is that 7201 doesn't define a class of revenue loss offenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="2961.959" offset="11953256">Instead, it defines a class of tax evasion It only refers to the one statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.463" offset="11971229">And -- and then in that context, where there has to be a deficiency in order to -- for there to be a 7201 conviction, there must be a tax deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.652" offset="12004039">Then it is natural to talk about the relevant losses being revenue loss to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.287" offset="12018563">The phrase in (M)(i) is broader because it also applies to other types of frauds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.072" offset="12033714">And I think that the reference to 7201 alone doesn't indicate Congress is intending to weed out all tax offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.893" offset="12057015">As Justice Ginsburg mentioned before, although 7201 has a 5-year maximum statutory penalty, which is longer than the 3-year maximum that applies under 7206 and some of the other tax offenses in that particular chapter of Title 26, as a practical matter, the -- the sentencing guidelines use the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.540" offset="12139562">The -- the same criteria that are both tied to loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.409" offset="12151056">And more importantly, a lot of these other offenses, like 371 and 1341 and 1343 in Title 18 actually have longer maximum punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.514" offset="12191493">So if the government wants -- has a particularly big fraud that they want to -- to get after somebody who has a tax evasion case in which they've cost the government a great deal of money -- it may choose to proceed under one of the other provisions where it can get an even greater punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.291" offset="12250634">And so just referring to 7201 as the capstone I don't think allows it to be a stand-in for all other tax offenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="3138.091" offset="12657831">And it's a very important case decided by this Court which said that filing a false statement is not -- is not indicative, not evidence of an intent to deceive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.768" offset="12716450">Similarly, the Harry Bridges case, also decided by this Court, said that -- and the Court held that making a false statement about Mr. Bridges' involvement with the Communist Party is not evidence of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.484" offset="12815402">These cases, I believe of this Court, control the issue that deceit or fraud is not an essential element for this crime of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.511" offset="12883425">Following up what Justice Kagan has said, has asked, that the rules -- canons of construction that the Petitioner has invoked, the rules of superfluities -- again superfluities -- the idea that a court must give cognizance to different words meaning different things -- that is, revenue loss from the government is different from revenue loss to victim or victims, and the specific versus the general.</text>

            <text syncTime="3259.620" offset="13143918">The position of the government in this case is simply that tax evasion may not be in 72 -- or may not be in (M)(ii), the reason, rather, that fraud and deceit may not be in tax evasion, but that a lesser revenue offense is in (M)(i).</text>

            <text syncTime="3442.037" offset="13873570">In any compromise the government chose only to charge them with a crime under 7206 which -- and to settle on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.118" offset="13945877">As Justice Alito has mentioned in the Padilla case quite emphatically, that attorneys representing immigrants deal with the government in order to avoid deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.733" offset="14040336">And that -- in this case whether the Kawashimas had in fact filed false returns in an attempt to deceive, that was by the boards, because the government and the taxpayer agreed that their offense would be solely 7206, which as you read the elements, and you can read the Justice Department handbook which tells you what the elements are, and it does not include fraud and deceit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.387" offset="14174919">If there are no further questions I -- finally I would like to mention one case which hasn't been brought up, which evolved from the questions by the justices, and that is a Third Circuit case which we cited, Nugent -- mentioned in response to Justice Breyer's question, that the Nugent case said that you must fulfill both elements, that is the perjury, S under the statute, and if it's included in fraud and deceit, you must fulfill the elements of both crimes at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.900" offset="14352969">And of course in this case, the Kawashimas did not -- were imprisoned for 4 months and did not meet the statutory requirement for an aggravated felony of 1 year.</text>
