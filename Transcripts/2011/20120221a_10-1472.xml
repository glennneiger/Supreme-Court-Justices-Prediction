            <text syncTime="335.198" offset="1447590">And the way they -- these provisions interact in broad strokes that makes perfect sense in our reading is that in the -- in the primary class of cases that motivated the passage of this statute, namely cases brought by the government where there were significant constitutional confrontation clause concerns about criminal defendants not understanding the spoken proceedings, in those core class of cases the Congress elected to pay for spoken interpreter services directly in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.099" offset="1551243">Now, in the non-core class of cases litigation, private civil litigation, the Congress elected not to pay for these services, but in 1920(6) to facilitate them in the lesser manner of providing that a party that incurred these expenses could recover them at the end of the case if it won.</text>

            <text syncTime="389.201" offset="1663674">And in fact, to certify a document that comes into the Federal court in San Juan, you have to have it translated very often.</text>

            <text syncTime="430.945" offset="1830649">And this just, again, confirms that the usual congressional practice of differentiating between these terms in -- in statutes generally was fully applicable here, that the Congress knew the difference between these terms, used them appropriately, and the fact that having removed that -- that provision from the statute, the statute as passed contains only the words "interpreter" and "interpretation", and no forms of "translate" just again reaffirms that -- that the ordinary meaning of these terms should apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="2873.207" offset="11599609">And so, the question is, do we take -- go with the smaller capabilities and leave well enough alone or do we say, gee, that is just too hard to translate that -- to interpret the statute that way.</text>

            <text syncTime="2927.628" offset="11817366">I think the history of this is strong evidence that it's not difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.412" offset="11836488">Courts have been doing this, certainly, since 1978 when this provision was added and even before then.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.166" offset="11859475">And they haven't had any evident difficulty in deciding whether to tax documents in its document translation, and if so, how much.</text>

            <text syncTime="2977.458" offset="12016628">--I can't think of any case off the top of my head, and I think it's true that this case is a little bit different, because insofar as courts were taxing document translation costs before 1978, they were relying on something other than the word "interpreter".</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.403" offset="12084442">So it may be a stretch to say that when Congress chose to use the word "interpreter", it was necessarily incorporating what courts had previously done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.109" offset="12123312">But I don't think it's entirely irrelevant that this has been done for a long time, and I think it's not unfair to presume that Congress would have been aware of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.566" offset="12161137">The Court Interpreters Act has two main provisions as relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.387" offset="12192380">There's section 2, which is really the more -- the main provision -- and then section 7, which became 1920(6) in Title 28, which is the provision at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.849" offset="12258208">An important part of Taniguchi's submission is that section 2 is limited to oral translators, and therefore, it should follow that section 7, the provision at issue here, is likewise limited to oral translators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.226" offset="12327694">And our main submission on that -- on that question is that Congress actually used different language in section 2 and section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.832" offset="12366146">Section 2 added two provisions to Title 28: section 1827 and section 1828, which are titled, and which address, respectively, interpreters in courts of the United States, and special interpretation services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.692" offset="12429572">In section 7, which added subsection (6) to 1920, Congress does not use those two phrases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.715" offset="12461650">Instead, it uses the phrase "interpreters" simply, not</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.618" offset="12681288">"interpreters in courts of the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.501" offset="12681183">and then "special interpretation services".</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.570" offset="12681079">So to the extent that there is any appropriate canon about the use of similar or different language in different provisions of a statute, it seems to us that the appropriate canon is that one should presume that when Congress uses different language, it intends different meanings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.099" offset="12680974">I do want to respond to Mr. Fried's point about the number of times the word 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.538" offset="12680870">And as I understand his point, it's that -- it's that it is much more frequently used by itself than it is with the -- with the words</text>

            <text syncTime="3135.512" offset="12680661">What the statute actually does is add -- say that it's adding section 1827, which it calls</text>

            <text syncTime="3157.692" offset="12737608">I'm sorry, this is the red brief, 1a of the appendix, which is the very beginning of the Court Interpreters Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.865" offset="12766238">And then there's subsection (c), flipping over to the next page -- I'm sorry, subsection (b) -- which says that</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.138" offset="12799361">"the director has to certify interpreters in courts of the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.172" offset="12819528">So what it does at the beginning of the statute is establish this thing called a certified interpreter in courts of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.397" offset="12856412">When it thereafter speaks of interpreter simply, that's just a shorthand for a certified interpreter in courts of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.336" offset="12892148">So it seems to us that as far as the Court Interpreters Act is concerned, even if it's true that section 2 uses the term in the narrower sense, it doesn't necessarily follow that it's used in the narrower sense in section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.346" offset="12960171">And the only point I would add about that, as we set -- point out in our brief, it's really not clear that section 2 is limited to oral translators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.236" offset="13003743">Soon after the Court Interpreters Act was enacted, and for approximately 16 years thereafter, the administrative office would publish these notices in the Federal Register notifying the public that they were -- there were going to be certification exams for interpreters under section 2 of the Court Interpreters Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.269" offset="13095903">These were pretty streamlined notices, not long at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.904" offset="13114398">And one of the main aspects, the main sections of the notice, was a list of what the director of the administrative office said were the -- were the duties of interpreters in courts of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.528" offset="13160896">And to be sure, it listed simultaneous and consecutive interpreting, but it -- it listed sight translation and it listed document translation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.586" offset="13205199">So at a minimum, section 2 is not sufficiently clearly limited to oral translators, that the director of the administrative office couldn't issue these notices saying otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.513" offset="13268834">I guess the -- the last point I want to make about other statutes, some of which use the term "interpreter" and "translator" together, I have already addressed that in part by saying that in many of those statutes, it really is pretty clearly used in the narrower sense, because you're talking about members of a profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.846" offset="13374264">The -- the only other thing I would say about that is that the premise of Taniguchi's reliance on those statutes seems to be that it would be strangely redundant for Congress to speak in other statutes about interpreters and translators together, if, in fact, the two terms could be used interchangeably, and that redundancy should be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.580" offset="13473111">But subsection (6) of 1920 itself has a redundancy in it, because it covers both interpreters and special interpretation services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.836" offset="13514176">And I don't think anybody could dispute that anyone who carries out a special interpretation service is an interpreter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.507" offset="13540821">So it's not at all odd to have redundancy when Congress is addressing the subject of translation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3366.529" offset="13572899">Very briefly, Your Honor, three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.862" offset="13582303">In the first place, Justice Breyer, I just wanted to let you know that the first decision -- first appellate decision construing 1920(6) to encompass document translation was the D.C. Circuit's decision in Lam Quy in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.204" offset="13639668">Second, Mr. Himmelfarb noted that Black's Law Dictionary takes a definition that arguably could encompass document translation, but he didn't mention that the operative version of Black's in 1978 when this statute was passed did not -- was a different definition that excluded document translation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.802" offset="13726081">And this change in the definition occurred in 1999, in the seventh edition, after a number of these judicial decisions construing 1920(6) had come down, which supports Your Honor's observation that it could very well merely reflect a recognition of these decisions, rather than independent support for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.414" offset="13792537">Finally, Your Honors, Mr. Himmelfarb cited certain notices issued by the administrative office from many years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.452" offset="13824615">These brief notices were ministerial documents that simply announced a forthcoming examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.856" offset="13850215">The office has issued the guidance to judiciary policy, which is -- which is the fully expressed views on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.279" offset="13883965">And it's posted on the office's website.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.481" offset="13892742">It's current as of June 9, 2011 -- and expressly provides that document translation is not a part of the statutory services of an interpreter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.818" offset="13926074">If there are further questions, I'd be happy to address them.</text>
