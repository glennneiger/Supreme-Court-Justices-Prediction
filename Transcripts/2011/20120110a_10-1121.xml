            <text syncTime="10.172" offset="146119">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.058" offset="157612">Before addressing SEIU's motion to dismiss for mootness, it is important to remember the underlying facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.562" offset="183630">For 10 months in 2005 and 2006, more than 36,000 nonmembers, or nearly 40 percent of those employees represented by SEIU employed by the State of California, were compelled to contribute to the SEIU's $12 million Political Fight-Back Fund without being provided the opportunity to challenge the amount of the fee, and to object to its exaction required by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.927" offset="281119">Adding insult to that injury, the Ninth Circuit said that nonmembers could never say no to contributing to SEIU's political expenditures for ballot propositions, at least Proposition 76.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.603" offset="331797">They have no right to refuse to bankroll that element of SEIU's political speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.573" offset="355725">This defies this Court's decisions, distorting the political process on a massive scale.</text>

            <text syncTime="73.881" offset="400969">As -- as I understand your brief, you're -- you're essentially saying that it's impossible to moot a claim for nominal damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.785" offset="432525">Is -- is that a correct reading of your position?</text>

            <text syncTime="84.904" offset="445064">I'm not sure I would go that far, Justice Kagan.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.141" offset="461991">I think in this case, the wishy-washiness, as it were, of the language used by SEIU when it distributed this pasted-on dollar to the class -- or dollars, more accurately -- was inadequate because it failed to represent the importance of the judgment that the nonmember class had won.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="111.971" offset="553315">So that's a different point, right, which is that the notice was inadequate--</text>

            <label>Mr. William J. Young</label>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="115.791" offset="568571">--And when you say "inadequate", I read you to be saying sort of not apologetic enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.843" offset="588842">And -- in other words, not saying, look, you had a claim against us, we think you're right; it was a valid claim; here is your judgment in satisfaction of that claim; that it didn't forthrightly say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.937" offset="645162">But do you think if it had forthrightly said that, we would be living in a different Article III universe?</text>

            <text syncTime="152.048" offset="713603">If -- if the only question were the distribution of nominal damages, then perhaps we would be living in that different Article III universe.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.218" offset="742337">But this case is about the judgment of the district court that the SEIU was attempting to comply with.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.241" offset="770341">They failed to do so in virtually all of its elements.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="169.426" offset="783088">And how is that?</text>
            <text syncTime="171.212" offset="790298">How did they fail to comply, other than the question of whether they were forthright enough about the fact that they were satisfying the claim?</text>

            <label>Mr. William J. Young</label>
            <text syncTime="178.866" offset="820914">The -- the district court had ordered -- described the type of notice that it anticipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.137" offset="853932">The district court specifically determined that SEIU's subsequent 2006 financial disclosure was inadequate to cure the problem that was caused by the seizure of fees starting in September 2005.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.033" offset="921537">And that is on 73a of the petition appendix B.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.420" offset="947137">The union in this case merely sent the same financial disclosure in the notice that it sent -- to try to moot the case, that it had sent in June of 2006.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.362" offset="1006905">Well, the district court had already said this is inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.631" offset="1019967">That seems to me to end the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.000" offset="1033446">Obviously, the district court did not contemplate that the notice that was sent in June 2006 satisfied the obligations of its judgment; else it hardly could have ordered a useless act in ordering a new type of notice go out.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.866" offset="1124874">The reason that is important, Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, excuse me -- is that the SEIU is asserting that the case has become moot because it has now complied with the district court's judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.337" offset="1258726">But since the purpose of the notice is to provide the information necessary to -- to object, one of the purposes, then we certainly anticipate that there would be more objectors were there to be an -- an adequate notice that complies with the district court's judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1597.287" offset="6494605">Justice Ginsburg is absolutely correct that what we have suggested to the Court is that the court of appeals decision be vacated, with the consequence of reinstating the district court judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1616.599" offset="6571823">That's correct, Your Honor, and the reason for that is when the events in this matter were new and the then union officers' actions were being challenged, the instinct was: We are going to defend the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.043" offset="6633576">And as time went on there was no rethinking of that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.197" offset="6658236">When the case was granted here over our opposition, noting that we didn't think the questions presented were really presented, the officers of the union, who were not the ones involved in the original case, thought about the situation and came to the realization that they have no stake in the procedures that are at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.794" offset="6748620">This is a local that had never done a mid-year increase in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.049" offset="6773593">What was contemplated as a temporary increase here turned into a permanent increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.601" offset="6795849">The dues went up to 1.5 percent of salary a year after this increase ended.</text>

            <text syncTime="1700.705" offset="6908280">But this local has put in a procedure which frankly would satisfy the Petitioner s' concerns for the future if future conduct was legitimately at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.114" offset="6961883">But it is not, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.980" offset="6969302">First, when we state that the district court judgment would be reinstated, that's a judgment that was not appealed by the Petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.220" offset="7002321">That defines the limits of what they can attain from this case, whatever this Court may decide, and that decision gives whatever protection it gives against future conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.361" offset="7050909">Now, it gives essentially none for a very good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.646" offset="7063970">This was a case that has been noted, brought only about a one-time event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.532" offset="7079539">There were no allegations of an ongoing practice, there was no request for declaratory or injunctive relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1749.001" offset="7101377">Mr. Collins, as I understand Mr. Young's argument, there is a serious dispute about the adequacy of this notice, and it might be a dispute about whether it was clear enough, about that it was satisfying claims, or it might be a dispute about whether it allowed refunds easily enough, but that Mr. Young is contesting whether the notice complied with the district court's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.951" offset="7193224">Now, as long as that's true, don't we have a live case before us?</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.003" offset="7209420">Somebody has to answer that question about whether your notice complied with the order, and if it's the case that a court has to answer that question, doesn't that depend on the questions presented here, the substantive questions?</text>

            <text syncTime="1789.828" offset="7264695">No, it doesn't, Justice Kagan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.964" offset="7273263">The Court's explained in a number of cases, beginning I think with Walling v. Ruder, and also obviously Munsingwear, and U.S. Bank Corp., a case can be in a posture where this Court in disposing of it needs to grant certain relief, clarification of the status of prior orders, and yet the case is moot on the merits such that the Court cannot appropriately reach the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.432" offset="7379111">That's what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.932" offset="7385172">If there is a dispute -- and I will explain in a moment why there really isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.752" offset="7400427">But if there is a dispute, for example, as to whether an individual failed to get their refund because the notice was inadequate, that dispute is not affected by and requires no decision of this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.809" offset="7456643">If the district court judgment is reinstated then the question of whether we have fully provided all relief called for by that judgment, which we believe we have, would be before the district court's decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1853.855" offset="7520799">The whole point of your friend's argument with the Hudson notice is they want people to understand what's happening with their union money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.179" offset="7570119">And they say this notice didn't let people know that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.047" offset="7581612">And if the case is not moot and if they prevail, they will have a right to be heard on what the notice should say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.553" offset="7611601">And that will make a difference in how many people opt out or how many people don't.</text>

            <text syncTime="1895.615" offset="7687879">First of all, the district court required a certain kind of notice to be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.086" offset="7713792">We are stating the district court judgment should be reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.304" offset="7726644">If the notice we have given does not comport with what the district court judgment which was not appealed by the Petitioners requires, it will be provided by the district court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1922.932" offset="7797175">The notice is only required by the district court if the case is not moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.021" offset="7825492">If the case is moot by the notice you sent out, the district court doesn't have a case on the basis of which to order a different notice.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeremiah Collins</label>
            <text syncTime="1938.461" offset="7859242">No, I don't think that's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.494" offset="7867392">A case can be moot in this Court and this is what I believe Munsingwear, Walling v. Reuter and the other cases, U.S. Bancorp more recently, explained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.666" offset="7904068">At first it seems paradoxical, but it is not paradoxical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.053" offset="7925593">A case -- there can be remaining issues potentially in the district court, such as whether the check that the plaintiff paid bounced or not, that could potentially have to be resolved by a district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.246" offset="7982435">And it -- but it means, at least in terms of prudential mootness, there is not a substantive merits issue remaining for the court to be deciding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.519" offset="8023500">And it's really quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.388" offset="8031023">The Petitioners, as I say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.638" offset="8035934">Are looking a gift horse in the mouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.271" offset="8042517">The apex, the acme that they can achieve in this case, is what they got from the district court and it was reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.910" offset="8069057">We are saying: Give it back to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.960" offset="8077312">Take back the reversal, reinstate the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.612" offset="8087865">Whatever they won they will have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.731" offset="8096329">We believe we have already given them everything they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.433" offset="8107196">If we have not, the district court will do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.051" offset="8117645">But let me explain the second point, if I may, Mr. Chief Justice, which is that there is no legitimate issue here about whether the notice was adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.721" offset="8148261">Mr. Young stated quite incorrectly that the notice we have provided is the same as the notice the district court struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.029" offset="8189534">That's absolutely incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.231" offset="8198311">The district court said that the 2005 notice issued before the dues increased obviously did not give specific notice of the dues increase, although it stated that dues could be increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.623" offset="8247944">The district court specifically held at petitioner appendix 73a that the 2006 notice which described the so-called fund and the dues increase and the purposes of it was completely adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.882" offset="8312936">And the notice the district court -- one also has to realize, the district court was requiring the union to refund only the non-chargeable portion of activities attributed to this increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.160" offset="8378034">A certain kind of notice would be needed for that to justify how the union was computing what it was saying with the chargeable portion to refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.266" offset="8414501">But what the union has done here is provide greater relief than the district court ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.884" offset="8428920">We have refunded every penny that anyone who requests had paid during the increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.073" offset="8461730">So there is no serious question that the notice that the union sent out, which explained what the increase had been spent on, sufficiently informed individuals as to whether they now want to get back every penny, as we have offered them, of what they paid under the increase.</text>
