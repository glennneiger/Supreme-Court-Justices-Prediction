            <text syncTime="1451.471" offset="5913391">But that does assume that "newly awarded" can't mean an entitlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.077" offset="5943798">And then you run up against some other statutory provisions where an award does seem to mean, not a formal compensation order, but instead an entitlement to funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.765" offset="5986534">So 908(d)(1), it seems as though the word 910(h)(1), it seems as though the word 933(b), which says "award in a compensation order", suggests that awards can be made in a formal order or awards can be made differently because of an entitlement that is automatically paid.</text>

            <text syncTime="2900.301" offset="11708709">I would like to begin if I may by addressing Justice Scalia's and the Chief Justice's questions on whether the term award can bear the meaning that ascribe to it and then explain why, since it can bear that meaning, this is the only sensible interpretation of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.394" offset="11768999">First, it is not uncommon, Your Honor, to use the term award to describe a benefit conferred by a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.814" offset="11794704">The dictionary definition is a benefit conferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.247" offset="11804421">Your Honor, Justice Scalia used a formulation, what if a statute awards a tax credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.301" offset="11828663">Well, the Court's decision in New Energy Company v. Limbach began an Ohio statute awards a tax credit to a certain producer of ethanol.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.609" offset="11865861">I think even Your Honor Alderson Reporting Company was the author of that decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3015.157" offset="12168046">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.724" offset="12170344">And that's why this is a case like Robinson v. Shell Oil, in which the word employer was used throughout Title VII in different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.096" offset="12199811">And what the court said is you then have to look at the context of the individual provision in which the word appears that you are construing to determine how the word is being used in that particular provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.052" offset="12239726">And here the most fundamental reason why it is an untenable construction of this act to rely on the date of a compensation order to determine the applicable maximum rate is that then the act would be silent as to the maximum rate in the vast majority of instances in which compensation is paid, because as Mr. Palmore said, in the vast majority of instances no claim is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.834" offset="12334811">And as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, when no claim is filed, no compensation order will ever be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.988" offset="12359471">And that's not an accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.523" offset="12365531">That is a function of a very central feature of the act's design that Petitioner's interpretation is entirely at odds with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.994" offset="12391445">The act is designed to enable compensation to be calculated precisely and as early as possible so the money can get into the employee's hands very quickly and with a minimum of instances in which the administrative machinery has to be invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.503" offset="12445466">That's why the norm is no compensation order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.872" offset="12458945">And so Petitioner's interpretation is counter to that in at least two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.757" offset="12474514">It relies on the existence of a compensation order which in most instances won't and shouldn't issue, and would maximize, rather than minimize, the number of instances in which someone has to go and get an order to force compensation orders out of a system to make Petitioner's interpretation work even though everything is happening exactly as the Act says it should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.504" offset="12561450">The employer is voluntarily paying exactly the amount that the employee says is due, and there is no need to get the agency involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="3122.979" offset="12599380">I understand the amounts are here, but if it's five years, and apparently the employee was happy to wait five years to get an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.132" offset="12631980">Normally if you are an employee and you are disabled, and the employer says, well here's what we are going to give you, and it's based on the maximum of the latest we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.055" offset="12659670">You're not going to say: I'm going to wait; these wages are going to go up nationally, and I'm going to wait a year; maybe I'll wait for years because I think there's a trend on national average wages, and I'm going to cash in on that; I am going to be without money for the next four years and I am disabled but -- I mean, that doesn't sound to me to be a plausible situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3163.754" offset="12762488">Then the question is, in that circumstance where the employer is doing everything right, what can the employer do to force out of the system a compensation order that will lock in the maximum rate?</text>

            <text syncTime="3196.058" offset="12891742">And under Petitioner's interpretation, there would therefore be no knowable maximum rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.212" offset="12912327">And Petitioner's solution to that problem, on page 16 of his reply brief, is to say that the employer should threaten a bad faith cutoff of funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.901" offset="12947122">The employer should say: I will cut you off unless you file a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.019" offset="12959556">That is bad for everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.519" offset="12965512">It's bad for the employee who has access to payments delayed; it's bad for the employer who apparently is being told that it must controvert liability in bad faith because the employer doesn't in fact disagree that the employee is entitled to liability or face a 10 % penalty for cutting off the employee without a basis for controverting liability, and it's bad for the agency who suddenly has all these claims filed, all in a situation in which everything is working exactly as the Act intends.</text>

            <text syncTime="3370.221" offset="13588376">If, according to Justice Scalia's old opinion, the statute awards compensation at the time of disability, essentially what you would be saying is that an employer who becomes disabled in a certain year is awarded compensation at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3398.925" offset="13703210">I agree the statute awards it, but when you say somebody is "newly awarded", you're talking about an event at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.495" offset="13733407">And that's -- that's a different usage.</text>

            <text syncTime="3408.161" offset="13740095">I think the function of "newly" in this statute is something different, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.947" offset="13755246">And that relates to the questions that Your Honor and Justice Breyer were asking about the relationship between the "currently receiving" clause and the final clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.636" offset="13785966">I think the 19(f), which provides for a COLA, a cost of living increase every year for that narrow subset of the most disabled of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.895" offset="13851063">They and they alone get that annual bump-up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.497" offset="13861407">And so that "currently receiving" clause is written for that category to make sure that their bump-up isn't capped by a static maximum rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.572" offset="13901740">The other part of the clause, "newly awarded compensation", is about everybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.624" offset="13917936">Now, I think the use of the word "newly" there is just to distinguish it from the "currently receiving" clause, which is escalating year by year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.278" offset="13944581">And those newly awarded compensation, meaning at one point, fixed in time -- only when you are "newly" awarded compensation are you then going to have your maximum rate fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.901" offset="13983033">And then -- and both Petitioner and we agree -- whatever it's fixed at, whatever year, that stays the same for the duration of your collection of compensation.</text>
