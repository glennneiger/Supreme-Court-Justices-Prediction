            <text syncTime="13.974" offset="160246">We're here today to urge the Court to reinstate the district court's decision, which faithfully applied this Court's precedents under section 101 of the Patent Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.198" offset="205176">The problem with the Prometheus patent is its broad preemption of a physical phenomenon, which prevents others like Mayo Clinic from offering a better metabolite test with more accurate numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.423" offset="254077">And this is a huge practical problem for patients.</text>

            <text syncTime="67.894" offset="376017">And it can't have a -- a different standard for a legion of autoimmune diseases, and there are dozens and dozens of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.298" offset="409558">And that's a broad field to preempt the natural phenomenon.</text>

            <text syncTime="84.987" offset="444353">And so it has already changed one range, and that's not the subject of the district court's finding that the lower number it's proposing is infringing.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.580" offset="502763">So it's not as broad as you are stating.</text>

            <text syncTime="102.949" offset="516242">Well, you -- you see, Your Honor, we believe the correct number is 450 to 700.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.935" offset="536095">And that's necessary to cure various autoimmune diseases.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.589" offset="554799">And Prometheus took the position that its patent preempts everything above 400, all the way up to infinity, it said, for all autoimmune diseases, dozens and dozens of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="126.814" offset="611641">Well, you know, actually it didn't, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.033" offset="620523">You will see in that opinion, there are two rulings: one is the 15 percent ruling, which lowers the number; but it said 400 and above all the way to infinity.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.407" offset="662006">There's no upper limit on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.591" offset="670783">So as a practical matter, there's no room for anybody else to offer a metabolite test.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.727" offset="691263">And what this means for patients is one opinion in the United States.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard P. Bress</label>
            <text syncTime="1910.569" offset="7746623">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.104" offset="7756863">I would like to start out, I think, with answering the question about what these patents cover and what they don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.792" offset="7787583">And I'm going to answer that really not because I think it has any relevance to the 101 issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.094" offset="7804824">I actually don't think it has any relevance to 101.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.363" offset="7813810">And I will explain that it does perhaps have relevance under 102 and 103 and why the difference matters, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.219" offset="7845261">So the district -- my friend is correct that in the district court at the initial infringement stage, before the Court decided the validity of the patent, we argued that the right way to look at our numbers was that we were claiming that if a doctor correlated or associated a number greater than 400 with toxicity, that's what we were claiming, that would be within our claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.321" offset="7965633">And if the doctor correlated under 230 with not enough drug, well, we were claiming that as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.761" offset="7999488">Now, the district court agreed with that and said that those were the ranges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.998" offset="8020386">But then it confused things a bit, and that's where we get to the 15 percent plus or minus point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.633" offset="8038881">The court also said -- and by the way, I think this is a correct reading -- that when we said about 400, that means plus or minus 15 percent of 400, and about 230 plus or minus 230.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.507" offset="8090394">And then the court held that there was infringement, but it held it for two different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.661" offset="8107008">It said that -- that the patent for Mayo -- or the -- I'm sorry, not patent, the product Mayo had, which by the way was awfully close -- it was 235 to 450 -- fell within the 15 percent on the top side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.088" offset="8172732">It didn't look at the bottom side for purposes of this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.373" offset="8181927">But 450 was within 15 percent of 400.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.075" offset="8196660">And it also said it violated it because 450 is greater than 400.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.729" offset="8215364">At the court of appeals we argued that the right way to read the district court's opinion was that you had to actually do that comparison, that the ranges, the 15 percents, mattered and that the doctor, in order to infringe, would have to look at the result and say: Is this or isn't this greater than 400 and compare it to 400, or 230.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.225" offset="8297284">The court of appeals accepted that reading of it, and that reading wasn't disputed by Mayo, and on page 38 of the court of appeals opinion, the court of appeals says it has to be compared to a predetermined number.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.985" offset="8352350">I think you could go either way on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.771" offset="8367501">I think, frankly, the Court could go back to the district court and look at that, perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.973" offset="8384324">But the problem with that is that there was no objection at the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.543" offset="8398535">And I think any objection to how the court of appeals understood it is probably waived at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.244" offset="8417343">Now for why it doesn't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.130" offset="8424866">If there is a problem with the broad ranges here, in other words if there is a problem with the fact that we're saying over 400 indicates toxicity, let's think about what is that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.754" offset="8479410">Suppose we are right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.123" offset="8484843">I mean, at this stage the Court certainly can't presume we are wrong in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.492" offset="8498322">So let's suppose that we are right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.860" offset="8507831">If we are right, then we are simply claiming the fact that we found, that after you administer the drugs and determine the metabolite level, if it's over 400, it indicates toxicity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2368.133" offset="9576970">Your Honor, this Court has looked at two different ways to try to limit what are laws of nature, abstract ideas, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.739" offset="9611348">One way it has looked at is to say we need something physical; it has to be in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.059" offset="9636634">In other words, you have to move things, you've got to transform them, you have to apply machinery to them, that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.297" offset="9661607">So we just know off the bat you are not literally claiming just a principle in the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.082" offset="9680729">So in your example, if you used, you know, machines, implements, et cetera, to do it, at least we would know that much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.438" offset="9710195">I think the problem that Your Honor's raising is more in the second stage, which is, okay, it isn't just a mere principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.293" offset="9741542">I get that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.826" offset="9743736">But are we as a practical matter preempting an abstract idea in such a way that we are going to too greatly suppress follow-on invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.851" offset="9795772">And the classic example of that, Your Honor, is the Morse case, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.886" offset="9811968">In Morse there were two different claims that were being discussed, actually eight different claims being discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.826" offset="9839658">But one of the claims had to do with the actual invention of how you can make a telegraph work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.980" offset="9860347">And Morse described a working telegraph system and he got a patent for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.765" offset="9879468">And the second one that he tried to claim was the use of electricity to write at a distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.787" offset="9907576">AND the reason he didn't get that one is that it was expressed at such a level -- high level of abstraction, that it would preempt many, many things that he had never invented and never thought of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.226" offset="9953343">In fact, the Court's words were wonderful in that case: "For aught we now know", the Court said, somebody may come up with wonderful inventions in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.534" offset="9990541">And of course now we have the fax machine, e-mail, et cetera.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard P. Bress</label>
            <text syncTime="2520.932" offset="10188131">Well, there's a -- let me explain why I think there is not a problem with that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.085" offset="10204745">If you looked at the process for vulcanizing rubber, which Firestone patented many, many years ago, that involved you heat India rubber to a high temperature, you add sulfur and mineral salts, and that way you cure rubber into a usable way of using it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.463" offset="10274231">Now, many years later in Diehr this Court looked at an improved process, if you will, for making rubber which involved continuous measurement and the use of the Arrhenius equation to know when the rubber was cured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.938" offset="10328148">Now, there is no doubt that if somebody came out with a second one 10 years after Firestone had gotten the patent on vulcanization, they would have had to pay patent royalties for 10 years before their second one would have been free of patent royalties, right, because they would have had to respect the patent that Firestone got.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.434" offset="10410172">So the simple fact, in other words, that there may be further improvements to what you've done isn't where the court has ever drawn the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.105" offset="10436817">And I do think that in conceptualizing where to draw these lines, because at the edges they're indeterminant, they're elusive and they're going to be somewhat arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.230" offset="10473284">This is judge-made law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.680" offset="10479135">I think that what you've got to look to is what you've done before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.015" offset="10492406">And if we take this case in the spectrum of what this Court has looked at, where you've got Morse on one side, on that same side you've got Benson, which was simply a formula for converting binary coded decimals to pure binary, which the court said you could use for an infinite number of uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.809" offset="10563668">It was way too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.345" offset="10569728">If you look at Bilski, a general way of -- a general -- the concept of hedging.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.999" offset="10592402">Now Bilski was limited, admittedly and this Court discussed it and said, well, they tried to limit it with the conventional step of having the inputs determined by random analysis techniques.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.140" offset="10640990">I would like to focus on that for a second, because the Court said that was not significant extra solution activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.961" offset="10664291">It wasn't enough to either render the process a physical one in the world or to narrow its scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.031" offset="10688533">Well, why is that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.131" offset="10692921">Because random analysis techniques are themselves just an abstract idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.684" offset="10715178">So you were adding one abstract idea to another one and it's no wonder that the Court found that it didn't narrow it to a patentable scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.088" offset="10744748">Now on the other side of the line we have cases Tilghman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.242" offset="10761362">Now if you look at Tilghman, Tilghman was a patent on the fact that if you use water at a high heat and high pressure, you can separate out from fat bodies, the fatty acids on the one hand and the glycerin on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.567" offset="10814652">And this Court approved a process -- a patent process on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.371" offset="10829908">Now that's of course a natural law, Justice Alito, no question about it, in terms of is it a law of nature that makes you do that, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.524" offset="10858538">But the Court was comforted in that case by the fact that the patent wasn't trying to generally patent monopolize the idea that water at high pressure and temperature is going to in general break bonds of chemicals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.534" offset="10914544">And it wasn't trying to either monopolize the whole idea of how you can separate fat acids and glycerin from fat bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.473" offset="10946309">There are other ways, including the use of sulfuric acid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.707" offset="10955191">Let's place this case in the continuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.259" offset="10965431">Now, we are not trying to pass the general broad idea that you can use metabolite readings after you administer the drug to determine what the likely, what the best level of the next administration might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.900" offset="11016004">That would be kind of like the Morse patent, and that's not what we are doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2787.557" offset="11254659">All right, Your Honor, first of all most of the claims here have three steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.961" offset="11276288">So you have an administering step which clearly carries its own benefits with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.115" offset="11300843">It's not novel, but it's certainly a process step that in and of itself could be a process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.435" offset="11326130">We couple that with determining -- you determine the amount of metabolites and the next step gives the doctor valuable information in order to decide what to do next.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.409" offset="11373986">Now why didn't we say, if it's over 400 you must decrease because that doesn't correspond with how doctors practice medicine, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.480" offset="11402303">So for example, you've got a patient for whom you've got a particularly sharp outbreak of Crohn's disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.384" offset="11425917">You may well be willing to go above the normal 400 level if your other tests, your liver toxicities, your white blood cell counts etc.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.656" offset="11463011">, tell you that for this patient at this time given that condition I am willing to risk some additional toxicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.810" offset="11483596">On the lower end of the scale you may have somebody under 230 who seems to be improving, they seem to be moving towards remission, why push it, why increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.332" offset="11517764">And this is not unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.284" offset="11525496">And that's one of the things I think I've got to stress here is the notion of a patent only in the end producing information is old in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.657" offset="11563008">And by the way to produce the information you are always going to have a step at the end that is some kind of an algorithm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.794" offset="11583592">Like a very simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.211" offset="11589235">But it takes the data, the raw data and turns it into something useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.579" offset="11606685">So for example, in the 19th century there were patents on the use of electricity to locate veins of ore and valuable minerals in the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.721" offset="11647331">Now that patent didn't say after you found it, you have got to dig it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.540" offset="11670528">And according to Mayo, that would have to be the next step.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.909" offset="11684007">But of course you might have reasons for digging it out or not digging it out depending on your finances, depending on how deep it is and depending on what kind of ore it is, etc.</text>

            <text syncTime="3077.362" offset="12413868">And this is why -- and I'll use my case as a wonderful example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.398" offset="12425989">So in our case, what existed before in the prior art, so to speak, was people knew that you could administer thiopurines for these particular diseases, and by the way, they're not all diseases, just -- we do specifically exclude in these patents, for example, Host-versus-graft disease.</text>

            <text syncTime="3104.246" offset="12521388">But in any event, administration of thiopurines to address certain diseases: old in the art.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.983" offset="12540301">Different methods for finding analytes in blood cells such as high pressure liquid chromatography?</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.054" offset="12564647">Old in the art, no doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.704" offset="12571230">They were used together before we did them, but why were they used?</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.208" offset="12589202">They were used by people who were trying to come up with what we came up with.</text>

            <text syncTime="3127.945" offset="12616161">They were determining in order to try to find a new treatment method, a new way of calibrating the right dose for each individual patient based on their metabolism, and help seriously ill patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.538" offset="12670600">And the idea that we are not novel because people took some of the same steps along the way to invention that we actually succeeded in is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.810" offset="12715635">And in fact, this Court said so in American Wood-Paper, where it said that</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.381" offset="12729950">"incomplete and unsuccessful attempts to invent will not render not novel the successful inventor. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.718" offset="12759312">And in Bell, the Court said the difference between those who -- those who did not get the patents in Bell was only the difference between failure and success, and didn't say that because many of them had used similar methods but had not understood that continuous electrical lines as opposed to intermittent or pulsing electrical lines was going to be the difference for a working telephone.</text>

            <text syncTime="3307.346" offset="13333797">I -- I think that the answer is that when the problem is lack of novelty, when the problem is obviousness, the right place to go are the sections that actually have very clear rules on how to apply those, and that the problem with taking a short cut in that instance is, essentially, the Court would just imbue its own notions or pre-conceived notions of what should be patentable and pour it into it as opposed to following those rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="3588.325" offset="14457689">--Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.325" offset="14461659">Well, I think that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.361" offset="14465839">That's -- that is a second issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.044" offset="14472526">But the first issue is the breadth of the preemption, which precludes anyone else in the country, from saying as Justice Scalia did -- those numbers are wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.467" offset="14506277">And patients can't use those numbers safely or they won't get cured of this disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.252" offset="14521428">For 20 years, the public is stuck with the erroneous information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.203" offset="14537206">Now, counsel suggests that it's narrow preemption because it doesn't cover Host-versus-Graft or leukemia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.440" offset="14558208">Those are not autoimmune diseases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.559" offset="14566672">Every autoimmune disease is swept in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.344" offset="14577748">And there are dozens and dozens of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.661" offset="14587047">They have different characteristics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.046" offset="14592585">You don't take a "one size fits all" approach to autoimmune disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.998" offset="14608363">There are different numbers for different diseases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.284" offset="14617558">That's what Mayo is trying to do, to have some personalized medicine for skin disorders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.736" offset="14635321">And they said that -- that is an infringement and we're entitled to treble damages and an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.906" offset="14656010">Now, is this like the Morse case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.758" offset="14667400">Yes, it is like the Morse case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.210" offset="14673251">Prometheus is trying to preempt diseases it never researched, and it's trying to preempt numbers that differ from its numbers fundamentally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.732" offset="14707315">They have the number 7000 in their patented number.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.684" offset="14719122">We thought the number should be 5700.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.201" offset="14729153">This is a very dangerous toxic drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.386" offset="14737930">If you get the wrong number set in concrete for 20 years, that is a huge problem for patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.790" offset="14763530">And there are millions and millions of patients suffering from autoimmune disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.611" offset="14778890">So we urge the Court to protect the research process here that's so fundamental to American health and to the economy and the healthcare industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.300" offset="14813581">We thank the Court.</text>
