            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="107520">I have the opinion for the Court in Case No. 10-1491, Kiobel and others versus Royal Dutch Petroleum Company and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.570" offset="145763">The plaintiffs in this case are from Ogoniland located in the Niger Delta Area of Nigeria.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.216" offset="172304">The defendants are Dutch, English and Nigerian oil companies that engaged in oil exploration in Ogoniland.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.273" offset="204591">The plaintiffs protested those activities because of their adverse environmental effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.260" offset="228519">They alleged that the companies then enlisted the Nigerian Government to suppress those protest that, as a result, members of the Nigerian Army and police forces violently attacked, beat and murdered Ogoni villagers.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.889" offset="287033">The plaintiffs were eventually granted political asylum in the United States and they sued the companies in federal court for atrocities relating to the events in Ogoniland.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.336" offset="328829">The question is whether the US courts can hear a case such as this brought by foreign plaintiffs against foreign defendants over events that occurred on foreign soil.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.345" offset="372820">The plaintiffs say they can bring their suit under one of the oldest laws on the books, the Alien Tort Statute or ATS.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.027" offset="403540">It was passed in 1789 during the very first session of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.701" offset="422243">It is one sentence long and provides “The District Court shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only committed in violation of the law of nations or treaty of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="95.217" offset="488385">The issue is whether that statute applies to conduct that occurred entirely outside the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.285" offset="516598">Now, when Congress passes a statute, we normally assume that the statute governs only conduct here in the United States, not conduct in other countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.317" offset="552751">The reason is simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.842" offset="558811">First, it's just a matter of common sense that when Congress passes a law, it is passing a law that applies in the United States and not some other country unless the law tells us otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.431" offset="601234">Second, regulating conduct abroad risks serious foreign policy consequences and courts are and should be reluctant to invite such consequences unless that is what Congress clearly intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.238" offset="656405">Now, we see no reason to treat the ATS any differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.647" offset="670093">Like any other statute, we assumed that it applies only to conduct here at home unless we determine that Congress intended for it to reach conduct abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.208" offset="708336">And the text of the ATS, that one sentence, provides no indication of such reach, the mere fact that the statute mentions aliens or the law of nation is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.221" offset="752327">Violations of the law of nations affecting aliens do not necessarily occur abroad, they can happen right here at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.429" offset="781166">In fact, there were two notorious episodes just before passage of the ATS that show just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.296" offset="808647">In one, in 1784, a French adventurer assaulted a French diplomat in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.988" offset="835396">The French filed a formal protest with the continental Congress and threatened to leave United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.916" offset="859115">The potential lack of a judicial remedy for the diplomat precipitated a serious crisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.965" offset="883357">In the other episode, in 1787, a New York constable rated the Dutch Ambassador's home in New York and arrested one of his servants.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.198" offset="916271">The constable was arrested intern but Secretary of Foreign Affairs, John Jay, told the Dutch not to expect much because there was no law on the books that would allow a lawsuit for such a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.739" offset="966426">That changed when the ATS was passed two years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.801" offset="978651">This contemporaneous examples fall within the precise terms of the ATS but do not involve any conduct occurring abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.836" offset="1014805">Justice Story wrote in 1822 that no nation has ever yet pretended to be the custos morum of the whole world, the guardian of morals of the whole world.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.286" offset="1056601">It is implausible to suppose that the very first congress wanted their fledgling republic, still struggling to gain international recognition, to be the first such country and to open their new courts to suits by foreign plaintiffs against foreign defendants for wrongs occurring entirely on foreign soil.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.052" offset="1135700">Now, in modern times, when lower courts have undertaken to apply the ATS to such conduct abroad, affected foreign countries have vigorously protested what they have viewed as an infringement by the United States under sovereignty, country such as Canada, Germany, Indonesia, South Africa, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.400" offset="1213022">And keep in mind that if we say we can entertain suits by foreign plaintiffs against foreign defendants for conduct on foreign soil, there is no reason another country might not do the same to us that is, assert jurisdiction to hear a case by a US citizen against another US citizen for events occurring in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.131" offset="1292016">Now, for all these reasons and others set forth in an opinion we have filed with the clerk, the plaintiffs cannot proceed with this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.841" offset="1322841">All members of the Court agree with that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.803" offset="1334648">Justice Kennedy has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.742" offset="1346456">Justice Alito has also filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Thomas has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.435" offset="1369234">Justice Breyer has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan have joined.</text>
