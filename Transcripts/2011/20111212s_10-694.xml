            <text syncTime="6.874" offset="135001">Petitioner in this case is Joe Judulang, a native of the Philippines who has lived in this country for many years as a lawful resident alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.105" offset="171886">Recently, the Government sought to deport Judulang based on a manslaughter conviction occurring in 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.055" offset="203651">Judulang tried to apply to the Attorney General for what's called relief from deportation, essentially, a waiver of the deportation law that would allow him to stay in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.445" offset="253283">The Board of Immigration Appeals, I'm going to call it the BIA, ruled that Judulang was not eligible to seek a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.671" offset="290168">In this case, we've reviewed the BIA's policy for deciding when resident aliens like Judulang may seek relief from deportation under former section 212(c) of the immigration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.765" offset="350563">Today, we hold that the BIA's policy is arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.919" offset="375118">The legal background of this case, as you will see, is complicated, but the principle governing our decision is anything but, when an administrative agency sets policy, it must provide reasons, an explanation for its action that makes at least a modicum of sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.522" offset="449515">That's not a high bar, but it is an important one.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.599" offset="465816">And here, the BIA failed to meet it.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.962" offset="483265">Now, the BIA policy here rests on a distinction that the immigration laws draw between exclusion and deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.541" offset="513672">An exclusion case involves an alien trying to gain entry to this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.146" offset="532062">A deportation case involves an alien already in the country whom the Government is trying to remove.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.789" offset="558602">The immigration laws provide one list of reasons for excluding an alien and a separate list for deporting an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.612" offset="593920">The statute calls these reasons grounds and many of the grounds focus on prior criminal convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.721" offset="626312">So for example, one ground for excluding an alien is that the alien has previously committed a crime involving moral turpitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.980" offset="663406">Well, one ground for deporting an alien is that he has committed what's called an aggravated felony involving a crime of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.649" offset="702067">Section 212(c) is the key statutory provision in this case.Congress repealed that provision in 1996, but it continues to apply when an immigration action is based on a guilty plea entered before that year, as Judulang's was.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.890" offset="771030">Under section 212(c), the Attorney General had broad power to permit the entry of aliens who could have been excluded from this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.806" offset="810736">The provision was silent about whether the Attorney General had similar power to waive the immigration law in deportation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.041" offset="843651">But over time, the BIA decided that section 212(c) should sometimes apply in those cases, as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.181" offset="880222">This case concerns the BIA's method for deciding when that is so, when a deportable alien is eligible for relief under section 212(c) or to say that another way, when the Attorney General may waive the deportation law and allow the alien to stay in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.251" offset="960470">The BIA's approach is called the comparable-grounds rule and it's the thing that we review and that we invalidate in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.734" offset="1002371">Under the comparable-grounds rule, the BIA first looks to the ground of deportation charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.239" offset="1028389">So here, Judulang was charged with what was called an “aggravated felony involved in a crime of violence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="237.818" offset="1058691">Then the BIA asks whether that ground has an analog in the exclusion context.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.850" offset="1082828">In other words, is there an exclusion ground that covers the same set of criminal offenses, neither more, nor less, nor different?</text>
            <text syncTime="253.496" offset="1121489">If there's no matching ground, the alien is ineligible for a waiver from deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.264" offset="1148552">So here, Judulang could not apply for relief because the crime of violence, deportation ground with which he was charged, has no analog in the list of exclusion grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.915" offset="1199125">Now, in an exclusion case, an alien with a manslaughter conviction would be eligible for section 212(c) relief because that crime would have fallen within the ground for crimes involving moral turpitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.542" offset="1257639">But according to the BIA, the moral turpitude exclusion ground does not correspond to the crime of violence deportation ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.037" offset="1295569">Although both grounds include manslaughter which was Judulang's crime, each includes some criminal offenses that the other does not and so Judulang was out of luck.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.704" offset="1350322">Now, I'm looking into the courtroom right now and I'm seeing some confused faces.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.433" offset="1377176">But if the comparable grounds rule doesn't make much sense to you, not to worry because it doesn't make much sense to us either, and that's the point of our decision today.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.312" offset="1428689">It's why we hold that the rule is arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.954" offset="1447288">The problem here is that we can find no good explanation for the comparable-grounds rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.173" offset="1472157">Under the BIA's approach, an alien's eligibility for a waiver does not turn on the seriousness of his prior crime, neither does it turn on the length of the alien's residence in this country or on any other circumstance of his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.676" offset="1542165">Instead, the alien's eligibility hinges on the chance correspondence between disconnected statutory categories, but that matter is irrelevant to an alien's fitness to reside in this country and because that is so, it cannot form the basis of a deportation decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.750" offset="1626488">We detail in our opinion why the Government's various attempts to justify the comparable-grounds policy do not succeed, but the long and short of it is, that we think the BIA's policy is essentially random, almost as if an alien's eligibility for relief depended on a coin flip.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.845" offset="1710811">When we cannot discern a reason for an agency policy, we cannot uphold it.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.750" offset="1734426">We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which approved the BIA's use of the comparable-grounds rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.229" offset="1768385">Our opinion is unanimous.</text>
