            <text syncTime="2970.508" offset="11987425">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.727" offset="12004352">The searches at issue in Bell are very similar to the searches at issue in this case, and they should be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.281" offset="12022533">I want to start with Justice Kagan's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.050" offset="12029639">It is true that contact visits with Bell are different from a person coming into the jail for the first time, in that there might be a greater opportunity for planning, but as one of the Justices pointed out, there was less of an opportunity to actually get contraband, the person coming in was going to be searched, the inmate, as Justice Marshall pointed out, was wearing a one-piece zip-up jumper, and he was being watched the entire time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.729" offset="12116365">The visit -- the contraband situation in this case at intake, the person does have an opportunity, even if they are not self-reporting, knowing that they are going to be arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.602" offset="12155862">Protesters, for example, who decide deliberately to get arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.971" offset="12169341">They might be stopped by the police, they see the squad car behind them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.256" offset="12182403">They might have a gun or contraband in their car and think hey, I'm going to put that on my person, I just need to get it somewhere that is not going to be found during a patdown search, and then potentially they have the contraband with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.546" offset="12223572">Also, the process of going from the arrest -- point of arrest to the general jail population is not a quick one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.900" offset="12253038">The person typically goes, for example, to a metropolitan police department -- that is what happens here -- and the person would mix potentially there in a holding cell with other offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.490" offset="12287415">If this Court for example adopted a rule saying that minor offenders would not be searched in a way that other offenders would, I have no doubt that there are some offenders in those circumstances, all on the bus together to go to the general jail population, who would give the stuff to the minor offenders--</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="3582.651" offset="14436039">Thank you, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.937" offset="14441159">I have three points to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.120" offset="14445861">The first is that my friend from the United States says defer to the experts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.507" offset="14463415">But the point that the United States consistently omits is that there are 600,000 offenders that go into the Federal system every year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.695" offset="14496225">I don't understand the claim that one -- this only involves 1 percent of Federal offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.882" offset="14508972">The marshal service and ICE admit 600,000 offenders every year under our standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.219" offset="14534259">They are not kept in separate housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.686" offset="14540215">These are cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.255" offset="14546484">600,000 people, is their expert judgment, are subject to a reasonable suspicion standard when they are admitted to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.491" offset="14571353">The second point about numbers, Justice Breyer, there is a significant empirical study, and that is, the County of Orange case, the district judge there did an unbelievable detailed job going through the record of 26,000 admissions into the system and was able to identify only a single instance where contraband would have gotten in under a reasonable suspicion standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.338" offset="14658811">There is also evidence in this case, and the evidence, to my surprise, that my friends keep pointing to, there is a memorandum from the Essex jail system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.944" offset="14693188">It's at page 70A to 71S of the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.065" offset="14709697">And it tells you two really relevant things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.298" offset="14718579">It says, every year they admit 25,175 people into this jail, and that they only found 14 instances of contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.055" offset="14757658">And they don't even make the claim that those 14 instances out of 25,000 would not have been found under a reasonable suspicion standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.976" offset="14789319">So you have evidence in this record about this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.361" offset="14802902">Third, a couple of points have been made about whether, Justice Breyer, you asked whether someone who is high on drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.267" offset="14830488">The uniform rule, and this is not just the ABA but the expert standard of the American Correctional Association, what they say is that essentially -- almost anything will do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.023" offset="14865492">What will not amount to reasonable suspicion is when you have a minor offender, and we do have -- There are 700,000 people in jail in the United States every year for misdemeanor offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.078" offset="14909691">There are a lot of people who are having a very significant intrusion on privacy and the expert standard, the rule that was applied under Bell v. Wolfish is when you have people who come in on a minor offense, they don't have any drug history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.222" offset="14958279">They are not high on drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.705" offset="14964234">There was no opportunity to hide a weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.940" offset="14973221">I'm not sure where they think the gun is going to be hidden that is not going to show up in the very close manual pat down that they do of every one of these people that isn't going to show up in--</text>

            <text syncTime="3742.491" offset="15075412">--Well, first, there are real categories that are overinclusive in favor of the jails, like if it's a serious offense or if they have any drug history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.495" offset="15103415">And then on top of that, if there is any individualized basis that the jails can articulate, that will do as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.999" offset="15129433">We are not saying that categorically people will be excluded from being searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.617" offset="15143852">We are saying that there are entire categories that is will automatically be searchable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.155" offset="15158063">We are just saying don't throw the baby out with the bath water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.355" offset="15166840">When somebody is pulled over like Mr. Florence and there's just -- it's laugh out loud funny to think he is smuggling in -- something into this jail; that it's too much of an intrusion to put him under the direct, you know, two feet away, I'm going to look at your genitals, as opposed to the ordinary intrusion of saying we are going to oversee the showers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.982" offset="15237371">There is no when it comes to that group of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.934" offset="15249178">And there are a lot of them that they represent anything like a material threat of smuggling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.222" offset="15266314">And this is a significant intrusion on individual privacy and individual dignity.</text>
