            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Scalia has our opinion in Case 10-1062, Sackett versus EPA.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="7.353" offset="135858">I'm tired already.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.730" offset="141396">[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="11.988" offset="154352">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.817" offset="177758">The Clean Water Act prohibits “the discharge of any pollutant by any person” into navigable waters, which the Act defines as “the waters -- the waters of the United States”.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.200" offset="251214">If the Environmental Protection Agency determines that a violation has occurred, it may then either issue a compliance order or initiate a civil enforcement action.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.747" offset="305445">If the agency initiates a civil enforcement action and wins, the resulting civil penalty may not exceed $37,500 per day for each violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.445" offset="364272">But at least as the Government tells it, that amount doubles to $75,000 per day when the EPA initiates and wins a civil enforcement action after a person has failed to comply with the compliance order.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.671" offset="437102">Michael and Chantell Sackett, the petitioners here, own a two thirds acre residential lot in Bonner County, Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.620" offset="476912">The property lies just north of Priest Lake but is separated from the lake by several lots with permanent structures on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.953" offset="514215">In preparation for building a house, the Sacketts filled in part of their lot with rock and dirt.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.661" offset="545040">Some months later, they received a compliance order from the EPA which stated that their residential lot contained navigable waters and that their construction project violated the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.091" offset="598852">The compliance order directed them not only to stop filling the lot, but also to restore the lot to its pre-construction condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.876" offset="633960">And the agency said, “For everyday the Sacketts failed to comply, they expose themselves to an additional $75,000 in potential liability.”</text>
            <text syncTime="144.469" offset="684325">The Sacketts, who did not believe that their land contained navigable waters having -- never seen a ship or other vessel cross their yard, [Laughter] sought declaratory and injunctive relief in the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.913" offset="746078">They argue that the compliance order was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act and that it deprived them of due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.083" offset="794770">District Court dismissed the claims for want of subject matter jurisdiction and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.583" offset="820788">The Court of Appeals held that the Clean Water Act precluded pre-enforcement judicial review of compliance orders and that such preclusion did not violate due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.000" offset="866450">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.639" offset="889020">The Sacketts may bring a civil action under the APA to challenge the issuance of the EPA’s order.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.685" offset="913157">The APA provides for judicial review of final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.913" offset="950147">First, the compliance order here has all the hallmarks of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.699" offset="973239">Through it, the APA determined rights or obligations, requiring the Sacketts to restore their property according to an agency approved plan and to give the EPA access to the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.082" offset="1026738">Legal consequence is also a flow from the order, which according to the Government’s litigating position, exposes the Sacketts to double penalties in future enforcement proceedings and the order severely limits their ability to obtain a permit -- a permit for their fill from the Army Corps of Engineers if, indeed, they are filling waters of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.040" offset="1130600">Further, the -- the order’s issuance marks the consummation of the agency’s decision making process, since the EPA’s findings that the Sackett's land was subject to the Clean Water Act were not subject to further agency review.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.451" offset="1196220">Second, the Sacketts had, as review requires, no other adequate remedy in a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.409" offset="1232060">A civil action brought by the EPA ordinarily provides judicial review in such cases, but the Sacketts cannot initiate that civil action process and each day, they wait for the EPA to drop the hammer, they accrue additional potential liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.787" offset="1309592">The Sacketts also may not obtain an adequate remedy by applying to a separate agency, the Army Corps of Engineers, for a permit and then filing suit under the APA if that permit is -- is denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.114" offset="1370927">They -- they would claim then that their land is not subject to permitting.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.601" offset="1392870">Since the agency’s decision was final and since the Sacketts have no other adequate remedy in a court, they may bring their suit under the APA.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.063" offset="1430695">Contrary to the Ninth Circuit's conclusion, the Clean Water Act is not a statute that precludes judicial review under the APA.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.969" offset="1462356">The APA creates a presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action as we have said in many prior cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.628" offset="1496942">While this presumption “may be overcome by inferences of intent drawn from the statutory scheme as a whole” the Government’s arguments do not support an inference that the Clean Water Act’s statutory scheme precludes APA review as it explained in further detail in the opinion filed today with the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.716" offset="1589311">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.714" offset="1609268">The opinion for the Court is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.134" offset="1618986">Justice Ginsburg and Justice Alito have filed separate concurring opinions.</text>
