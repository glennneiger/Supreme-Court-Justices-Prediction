            <text syncTime="1077.422" offset="4417202">Because it is clear from the history of this line on the passport that it is purely an identification of the individual; it is not an exercise of any foreign policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1095.717" offset="4490344">"any travel document issued by competent authority showing the bearer's origin, identity, and nationality. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.822" offset="4518766">And in this case, the history of this line on the passport demonstrates I think conclusively, and the State Department has acknowledged it, that it is purely a means of identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.695" offset="4562233">And what Congress has said is, with regard to these citizens we will permit them to identify themselves, like Congress permitted the Taiwanese to identify themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="1618.855" offset="6582857">And President Washington consulted with his cabinet, and of course his cabinet included Jefferson and Madison and Hamilton and Jay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.128" offset="6615980">And they decided that this was a power that was exclusive to the President to such an extent that they didn't even need to send a message to the Congress that they were going to recognize the new revolutionary government in France.</text>

            <text syncTime="1842.516" offset="7477499">Now, a couple of points there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.451" offset="7489306">I think the -- what -- the only thing that one could point to as an action by the Congress that even implicates the recognition power is one house of Congress passed an appropriations measure for an ambassador.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.627" offset="7550015">What the -- the history treatise, the global treatise that my friend cites says on page 133, the very page that he cites in his reply brief, is that Clay's effort to contest the President's exclusive authority came to a, quote, "inglorious end, unquote".</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.522" offset="7621590">He then goes on to say -- my friend goes on to say: Well, but a year later when President Monroe sought to actually recognize these South American republics he asked -- he asked the Congress to join him in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.901" offset="7691076">What he asked Congress for was an appropriation for an ambassador.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.585" offset="7705809">But it was not the sending of an ambassador to the Republic of Columbia that was the recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.858" offset="7730887">It was when President Monroe received an ambassador from Columbia that constituted the recognition, and that was an exclusive act that he undertook without any consultation with Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="1951.320" offset="7912699">President Jackson, in his first letter in 1836 to the Congress says essentially: I hear you; you think you we should recognize Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1992.797" offset="8078629">Then -- I think what is important, Justice Ginsburg, is that what Congress did next, as to pass two appropriations measures, one in the House, one in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.836" offset="8118857">Each of those measures appropriates funds for an emissary to the Republic of Texas, but each includes language that says: At such time that the President determines that it's appropriate to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.096" offset="8175804">If one looks at the page in the Congressional Globe that my friend cites, one will see that that language was added because as originally introduced the appropriations riders were objected to by members of the Congress on the ground that they infringed on the President's exclusive recognition authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="2979.667" offset="12026149">It's an area of -- of, you know, recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.885" offset="12042971">We know that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.270" offset="12044539">Never has this Court or anyone else held that Congress can go ahead in this area over a law passed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.224" offset="12072333">But it is passports, which both regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.776" offset="12082573">And our real problem is these are words that are officially said and they are detailed words, and those words may really disrupt coherent foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.901" offset="12131056">Viewed that way, there are billions of words that might have the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.721" offset="12154358">And do we know that these words No, judges don't know will and some other words won't?</text>

            <text syncTime="3017.106" offset="12175882">And therefore, when you get into this area, the best thing to do is avoid multifarious pronouncements by various departments of government on one question, do not respect the views of other branches, and judges, stay out of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3409.009" offset="13743543">Let me begin my rebuttal by echoing really what Justice Alito said during my colleague's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.979" offset="13767367">The question is whether anything that the President thinks bears on recognition, it forecloses this Court or any court from making that determination?</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.971" offset="13819402">This is not in our view a recognition case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.073" offset="13831732">This is a passport case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.841" offset="13842808">The question is, what goes on the passport, and may somebody self-identify?</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.547" offset="13869662">This is again, if one looks at the statute, if one even looks at the Foreign Affairs Manual, a passport is not today considered a diplomatic statement, it's an identification of a person in order to enable him to travel abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.806" offset="13934655">Now again, let me also echo what the Chief Justice and Justice Kagan asked during my colleague's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.579" offset="13965793">If in fact the statute had said we don't say Jerusalem is part of Israel, but you can identify yourself as being in Israel, my -- we submit that result can very easily be achieved and was achieved in the case of Taiwan by a public statement by the executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.896" offset="14071014">Congress -- this law can be enacted; people who were born in Jerusalem can have their passport say either Jerusalem or Israel, that's their choice; Congress hasn't said it has to say Israel, and then the Department of State can issue as it did in the case of Taiwan, a public statement saying, this is not official American policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.195" offset="14164219">Nobody's asking this Court to decide what is official American policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.481" offset="14185430">Nobody is asking the Court to decide what as Justice Scalia said would happen if there were no congressional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.569" offset="14217718">In that case it would be a political question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.938" offset="14227226">If my client had decided he wanted to have his passport say Israel and he had no congressional stature, and we brought the case to a court, the court could say, no, you are asking us to decide what the President should decide, what the Department of State should decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.048" offset="14287621">But other than that, Congress has enacted the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.352" offset="14304862">The -- the fact is that with regard to this legislation it is a statute which determines personal choice with regard to a passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.444" offset="14365257">The case can be a vehicle -- this case can be a vehicle for an authoritative clarification of the roles of Congress and the President in conducting the nation's foreign affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.217" offset="14408307">If so, then we submit Justice Jackson's statement, which acknowledges that Congress has the final word in the third category, is one that should control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.060" offset="14459716">But there are narrower grounds for enforcing section 214(d) that do not implicate separation of powers issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.666" offset="14498168">It's a passport law; it's within Congress's constitutional authority on the cases that have recognized that the President may not deny or restrict passports without the express or implied approval of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.175" offset="14560131">That doesn't require the recognition or involve the recognition of foreign sovereigns.</text>
