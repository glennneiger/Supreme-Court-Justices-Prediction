            <label>Mr. Kannon K. Shanmugam</label>
            <text syncTime="6.784" offset="131511">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.920" offset="144050">In Brady v. Maryland, this Court established the now-familiar principle that the prosecution must hand over all favorable material evidence to the defense before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.459" offset="182188">This case presents a flagrant violation of that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.328" offset="197757">The Orleans Parish district attorney's office produced almost no relevant evidence to the defense before Petitioner's trial, and Petitioner was convicted of first degree murder based solely on the testimony of a single eyewitness.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.368" offset="249898">Unbeknownst to the defense, however, that eyewitness had told the police on multiple occasions that he could not identify any of the perpetrators or, as he put it, that he would not know them if he saw them.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.795" offset="299530">The suppression of those statements alone justifies a new trial, but the district attorney's office in this case also engaged in the wholesale suppression of statements of numerous other witnesses, statements that further undermined the sole eyewitness identification of Petitioner and, more broadly, cast doubt on Petitioner's involvement and role in the shooting.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.474" offset="390332">If all of that information had been disclosed to the defense before trial, the jury surely would have viewed this case in a completely different light.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.478" offset="422306">The trial court therefore erred by rejecting Petitioner's Brady claim, and its judgment should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.615" offset="446861">In our view, in order to conclude that Petitioner is entitled to a new trial here, this Court need do nothing more than to consider the suppressed statements of the key eyewitness, Larry Boatner.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.190" offset="493150">Respondent concedes that those statements were withheld from the defense before trial, and argues only that the failure to disclose those statements was not prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.063" offset="532647">Those statements, however, could not have more clearly contradicted Boatner's confident identification of Petitioner at trial--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="115.317" stopTime="123.673">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="115.317" offset="565666">Wasn't there a picture?</text>
            <text syncTime="116.769" offset="571517">Boatner saw a picture in the newspaper and that turned on the light for him; right?</text>
            <text syncTime="121.823" offset="591684">It wasn't any police suggestion?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kannon_k_shanmugam" startTime="123.673" stopTime="192.217">
            <label>Mr. Kannon K. Shanmugam</label>
            <text syncTime="123.673" offset="599103">--That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.025" offset="604536">The basis for Boatner's identification was that he saw a photograph in the New Orleans newspaper of Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.131" offset="640899">It was in connection with an article describing the shootings and suggesting that Petitioner was one of the suspects in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.202" offset="673186">And that was what led to his prior identification out of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.939" offset="692203">But just to be clear, Justice Ginsburg, we are not arguing today that the identification was somehow constitutionally problematic.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.378" offset="721878">At most, we are arguing that the identification was of questionable validity in light of the fact that Boatner had only a limited opportunity to see the perpetrators and in light of the circumstances that led to his identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.269" offset="769421">Now, even if his identification were more clearly reliable, our argument today would be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.590" offset="794708">In a case such as this one, in which the sole basis for linking the defendant to the crime is the testimony of a single eyewitness, and there is evidence that the single eyewitness said on multiple occasions that he couldn't identify anyone, we believe that, absent extraordinary circumstances, that will be sufficient to--</text>

          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="192.217" stopTime="230.577">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="192.217" offset="873284">Well, aren't you exaggerating a little bit about the value of the impeachment evidence regarding Boatner?</text>
            <text syncTime="197.455" offset="894182">My understanding is that he made his first statement to the effect that he couldn't identify anybody at the scene, when he had been at the scene where five people that he knew very well had been killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.631" offset="950920">He was lying on the floor with a big gash on his head.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.417" offset="962100">He was questioned at the scene, and at that time -- this was in the evening -- he said: I can't identify anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.504" offset="990417">But then later that very day, wasn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="225.475" offset="1006299">That very evening, after midnight, he was questioned at the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.943" offset="1024167">Am I correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="231.461" offset="1030228">That's correct.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="231.828" offset="1031690">And at that point he gave a description.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.913" offset="1040050">He did make an -- he did provide a description of the person that he said was the one who first came through the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.150" offset="1068993">So, you know, that -- I don't know -- and then later, he said he -- there were statements to the effect that he couldn't identify anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.154" offset="1096997">But in light of the fact that he did provide a pretty, you know, somewhat detailed description on the very evening of the event, doesn't that -- aren't you exaggerating when you say that he said numerous times -- the effect of these statements that he couldn't--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kannon_k_shanmugam" startTime="264.950" stopTime="345.318">
            <label>Mr. Kannon K. Shanmugam</label>
            <text syncTime="264.950" offset="1164184">Justice Alito, it is true that Boatner provided identifying details in the later statement that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.937" offset="1188112">I would respectfully submit that they were relatively limited identifying details, simply the fact that the first man through the door had a low cut haircut and gold teeth.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.959" offset="1228236">And as we indicate in our brief, those were characteristics shared by numerous other suspects in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.029" offset="1248507">But I think more broadly, with regard to both sets of statements at issue here, the State's explanations for those statements are at best plausible.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.535" offset="1286541">And we really think that in a case such as this one, in which the evidence on its face is so clearly of high exculpatory or impeaching values, it takes something more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.093" offset="1328755">It is not sufficient for Respondent to argue here simply that, even taking into account these statements, a rational juror could still reach the same result and return a verdict of guilty here.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.150" offset="1377029">Because this Court made clear in Kyles v. Whitley that the standard for Brady claims is not a Jackson v. Virginia type sufficiency of the evidence standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.506" offset="1414437">So again, where you have statements on their face are not simply statements calling a witness' credibility into question, but statements that really directly contradict the confident in-court identification, it would take an exceedingly persuasive explanation for those statements to defeat a showing of materiality.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="345.318" stopTime="351.789">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="345.318" offset="1485699">The standard is a reasonable probability that the result would have been different, reasonable probability?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kannon_k_shanmugam" startTime="351.789" stopTime="437.358">
            <label>Mr. Kannon K. Shanmugam</label>
            <text syncTime="351.789" offset="1511508">Yes, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.121" offset="1516837">And this Court made clear in Kyles v. Whitley that that's not a more likely than not standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.025" offset="1536481">That is essentially the same standard that this Court has articulated for prejudice for ineffective assistance of counsel claims, under Strickland v. Washington, and by now it's a quite clearly established standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.702" offset="1595204">And again it requires something less than a showing of more likely than not and perhaps something slightly more than the showing required for harmless error under Chapman v. California.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.093" offset="1644732">But I do want to touch upon the State's explanations for these statements and explain very briefly why we think that those explanations are frankly not even plausible.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.830" offset="1679736">With regard to the first statement to which Justice Alito referred, the statement that was made at the scene approximately half an hour after initial -- officers initially responded to the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.487" offset="1726339">The State's argument is that Boatner was somehow too traumatized to make an identification at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.826" offset="1751730">But not only did Boatner not so testify at the post-conviction hearing -- in fact he testified that he couldn't recall the statement at all -- but the very officer who took the statement himself testified at trial in this case that at the time of the statement Boatner was, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="428.753" offset="1819439">"coherent and articulated very well the events that transpired. "</text>

            <text syncTime="437.358" offset="1853816">--That may be true, but if you were a juror and Boatner testified and he was cross-examined and they attempted to impeach him based on his failure to make an identification right at the scene and he said, well, that was because five of my friends had just been killed and I was lying on the floor and I thought I was going to be shot too and I had a big gash on my head, and then a couple of hours later when I collected myself and they asked me the same question at the police station I provided a description and didn't say I couldn't identify anybody, do you think jurors would just dismiss that and say, well, he couldn't identified him at the scene so he must have been lying when he identified -- when he provided a description later at the police station?</text>

            <text syncTime="664.240" offset="2761310">But I think more broadly, Justice Sotomayor, in terms of the role of this Court or any other court considering a Brady claim, this Court hasn't quite spoken to the specific issue of whether a Brady court is supposed to itself make an evidentiary determination where there is a question about admissibility, but the closest that this Court came was in Wood v. Bartholomew, in which this Court indicated that with regard to Brady material, it either has to itself be admissible or be reasonably likely to lead to admissible evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.794" offset="2891609">And the Court's reasoning in Wood v. Bartholomew was somewhat spare on that score.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.929" offset="2912089">That was a summary reversal and a per curiam opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.465" offset="2926299">But I do think that it would be appropriate for a Brady court to make that determination itself or at a minimum make a determination as to whether it appears that it's reasonably likely that the evidence would be admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.708" offset="2975201">Here we really don't think that it's a close question, particularly with regard to the statement of Shaelita Russell, because the context of the handwritten notes makes clear that the statement was taken at the scene of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.996" offset="3020340">Shaelita Russell was taken to the hospital approximately a half an hour after the shootings occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="763.154" offset="3157013">And Mims himself, in all candor, was a little bit inconsistent on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.640" offset="3174985">But he consistently said both in the handwritten notes and in his testimony at the post-conviction hearing that all of the assailants, however many there were, were wearing masks and that he saw them as they were getting into the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.115" offset="3232872">He didn't say anything further other than that the masks were ski-type masks.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.404" offset="3262025">But the State's argument with regard to the materiality of Mims's statement is that it is possible that the men would not have been wearing masks when they entered the house to allegedly commit the armed robbery and therefore the fact that Boatner saw the first man unmasked can be reconciled with his statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.550" offset="3342587">And again, we would be happy to take our chances with the jury and make the argument that that would be an exceedingly unconventional way to go about committing an armed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.073" offset="3376650">And again with regard to the Russell and Mims statements, I think it's important to remember that we view those statements as going directly to and contradicting Boatner's in-court identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.381" offset="3425970">And so in some sense we view those statements as being of a piece with Boatner's own prior statements in which he indicated that he could not identify anyone and that he would not--</text>

            <text syncTime="897.692" offset="3695135">It may very well have been that Boatner made a mistaken identification in good faith out of a desire to identify the person who killed several of his friends.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.714" offset="3739230">And indeed, as the amicus brief of the Innocence Project explains in this case, there is a phenomenon known as mug shot exposure effect, where an individual who sees a mug shot in some other context is more likely to identify that same person when confronted with a subsequent line-up.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.378" offset="3813940">Of course, where, as here, the individual is exposed to the mug shot for the first time in seeing a newspaper article that depicts the individual in question and suggests that that individual is a suspect in the crime, it would not at all be unusual for the individual when confronted with that photograph again in a line-up a few weeks later to pick that individual out.</text>

            <text syncTime="976.775" offset="4011530">Of course, it's possible that the person somehow had part of his face covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.512" offset="4030443">But I think it's important to realize, Justice Alito, that even with regard to that statement, while it is true that Boatner provided those limiting details, he also made statements suggesting that he was not confident of his ability to actually make an identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.856" offset="4091779">And in that statement, which is found at page 296 of the joint appendix, he says:</text>

            <text syncTime="1007.597" offset="4134828">So in some sense we think that the focus on the gold teeth and the low-cut haircut in this case is a bit of an aside, because the question here is not whether he saw enough to support the subsequent identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.173" offset="4193134">The question is whether his suppressed statements in which he repeatedly said, I can't make an identification, contradict his in-court confident identification of Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.481" offset="4238273">And we think that in order to decide this case, all that the Court essentially need say in an opinion is that in a case such as this one, in which all you have is the identification of a single eyewitness, where you have statements in which that eyewitness said, I can't make an identification, and those statements have concededly been suppressed, the Brady materiality threshold is satisfied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1117.615" offset="4574835">Now, with regard to these specific statements, both the narrative statements and the handwritten notes, the narrative statements were contained in a relatively voluminous document, I believe it was an 83-page document, that was a narrative prepared by Officer Ronquillo that set out everything that took place over the course of the investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1346.395" offset="5489957">There were also the statements that would have called into question the prosecution's theory that Petitioner was one of the shooters, a theory that was essential to establishing the intent required for first degree murder under Louisiana law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.802" offset="5543560">Louisiana is somewhat different from other States in that it doesn't require a premeditation, but that it -- but it does require a specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm.</text>

            <text syncTime="1370.944" offset="5588177">Well, on that point, the State says that you're drawing a meaningless distinction between a hand -- a 9-millimeter handgun and a 9-millimeter automatic pistol.</text>

            <text syncTime="1379.533" offset="5622554">Well, we don't think that that's a meaningless distinction, and we cite numerous sources in our brief that draw precisely that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.787" offset="5651498">But I think that what's noteworthy with regard to the statements at issue is that both Boatner, who identified the weapon that the perpetrator whom he believed to be the Petitioner was carrying, and the State's ballistics expert, Kenneth Leary, who identified the weapon that was responsible for the firing of the casings at issue, conspicuously failed to say that the weapon at issue was a 9-millimeter handgun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.069" offset="5744703">But at trial their testimonies suddenly converged and Boatner, who had previously said only that the perpetrator was carrying a handgun, said that the perpetrator was carrying a 9-millimeter handgun; and Leary, who said that the casings at issue had come from a machine pistol of the Intratec or MAC-11 type, suddenly said that they came from a 9-millimeter handgun instead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.418" offset="5834041">And so at a minimum, if the defense had possessed those statements, it could have sown doubt on whether the firearm was in fact one and the same and, therefore, sown doubt on a critical element of the offense at issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1447.094" offset="5892765">I'd just like to go back to that because I'm not sure that I understand the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.462" offset="5906244">Both the ballistics expert at trial said that the casings were consistent with a 9-millimeter, and I know that Boatner said that it was a 9-millimeter that was used, and the issue was whether anybody would call a MAC gun a handgun as opposed to an automatic pistol, correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="1469.608" offset="5982835">--Well, that's right with regard to Leary's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.376" offset="5989940">I think the thing that was a little bit odd with regard to Boatner's testimony was the sudden degree of specificity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.964" offset="6016272">Having said only that it was a handgun or a chrome automatic in his prior statements, he said at trial that it was a 9-millimeter handgun, which he had not previously said in the statements that were withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.539" offset="6066531">And, finally, the last category of evidence consists of the notes of the interview in which Eric Rogers relayed Robert Trackling's confession to involvement in the shootings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.745" offset="6111357">As the amicus brief of the NACDL points out, courts have routinely held that confessions by other perpetrators constitute exculpatory evidence, even with regard to offenses that may have had multiple perpetrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.489" offset="6162348">And we certainly believe that at a minimum the suppression of those notes, when considered in conjunction with all the other evidence, comfortably satisfies the Brady materiality standard, and it's for that reason that we think that the judgment of the trial court should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1550.674" offset="6307067">The only survivor who could identify the assailant who led the massacre in the small home at 2230 North Roman Street was Larry Boatner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.617" offset="6354819">He identified Larry -- he identified the Petitioner after having searched the faces of 72 individuals who were presented to him in photo line-ups, one after the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.775" offset="6411452">And yes, Justice Sotomayor, several of the -- of those faces or several of those individuals bore short fade haircuts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1593.153" offset="6476967">The record reflects that Mr. Boatner scrutinized those 72 faces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.790" offset="6499537">At one point line-up 11 was shown to him on March 22nd and he remarked about the haircut.</text>

            <text syncTime="3404.711" offset="13723230">First of all with regard to Larry Boatner's statements on March the 6th, Justice Breyer, you'll be happy to note that your law clerk's notes were correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.733" offset="13755308">Boatner on March the 6th said, and this is at page 308 of the joint appendix, could not ID anyone because couldn't see faces; can't tell if had faces covered; didn't see anyone; would not know them if I saw them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3427.676" offset="13815077">It is quite clear that that statement applies to all of the perpetrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.778" offset="13827511">The State advances the argument today, as it did in its brief, that Boatner must have been too scared to cooperate by March the 6th, but that is utterly belied by the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.134" offset="13868889">Boatner continued to cooperate with the police investigation in the following weeks reviewing police line-ups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.038" offset="13892504">He even testified that he wanted to go looking for Petitioner after seeing his photograph in the New Orleans newspaper, pages 489 and 494 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.309" offset="13929597">He didn't leave New Orleans until June, 3 months later, and he actually returned to New Orleans before Petitioner was even apprehended, so again--</text>

            <text syncTime="3463.665" offset="13959064">It is your understanding that the -- that all of Boatner's, all the notes about Boatner's statements were turned over to the judge before trial for in camera inspection?</text>

            <text syncTime="3470.903" offset="13988007">--Justice Alito, it is entirely unclear based on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.307" offset="14005666">Counsel for Respondent cites the transcript from October 31st, 1995, a transcript that wasn't even prepared until after cert was granted in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.829" offset="14047671">It's clear that the court reviewed something, but it is entirely unclear from that transcript what the court reviewed; and of course, even if the court had made an in camera determination it would no way -- in no way affect our claim after the fact here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.124" offset="14112872">My second point: The State today for the first time says in response to the question from Justice Scalia that there was more evidence here linking Petitioner to the crime and relies on the testimony of Eddie Young, the brother of Phillip Young, the individual who was found at the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.884" offset="14175984">But the sole substance of that testimony was that Phillip Young knew Petitioner, and we would respectfully submit that that is scarcely inculpatory, and if it was, anyone in New Orleans who knows a felon ought to be worried; and therefore we really don't think that that adds anything to the evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.630" offset="14258949">The sole evidence linking Petitioner to the crime was the statement -- the testimony of Larry Boatner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.867" offset="14283818">Third, there has been some discussion about the language in this Court's cases in Kyles and Agurs suggesting that prosecutors should err on the side of caution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.323" offset="14321643">That is part of the constitutional standard because after all, the materiality requirement is part of the requirement for a constitutional violation under Brady.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.448" offset="14362185">But all of the evidence at issue here including Boatner's statements was withheld from the defense, leaving aside this question of what the trial court may have reviewed in camera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.221" offset="14401264">And the prosecutor's conduct in this case, with all due respect to Ms. Andrieu, was not, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.307" offset="14421640">"a little too close to the wind. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.774" offset="14427491">The Orleans Parish district attorney's office acted with flagrant disregard for its obligations under Brady in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.980" offset="14456330">The Brady standard has been around for half a century.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.765" offset="14467406">There is no real ambiguity about what that standard requires, and we think that the conduct in this case was in fact egregious and clearly violated that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.621" offset="14506904">We think that the trial court erred by rejecting Petitioner's Brady claim and for that reason we think that its judgment should be reversed.</text>
