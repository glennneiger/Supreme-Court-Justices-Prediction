            <text syncTime="11.891" offset="154039">In Malley v. Briggs and United States v. Leon, this Court set forth a very high standard for denying qualified immunity in the civil context or suppressing evidence in the criminal context under circumstances where a police officer has procured a warrant that is subsequently determined to be invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.536" offset="228540">Specifically, the Court held that the initial magistrate's determination is -- is entitled to great deference, and that you will go behind that only in cases where the officer falsified information or omitted exculpatory information, where the affidavit was bare-bones, or there was some indication that the judicial officer did not perform the function, and then a catch-all provision, where the warrant was so lacking in indicia of probable cause that no reasonable officer could even submit it for a magistrate's determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.722" offset="353301">And specifically in Malley, the Court said it had to be the actions of an officer that was plainly incompetent or knowingly violating the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.578" offset="380782">This case arises from a Ninth Circuit decision that we submit does not apply the Court's standards, under circumstances where the officer submitted, far from a bare-bones affidavit, but a highly detailed, factual affidavit that we submit provided probable cause for the search or at least, under the Court's qualified immunity jurisprudence, a reasonable officer could believe that the warrant had probable cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="115.291" offset="567609">I can't recall the case, but I believe it has, and the circuit courts certainly have talked about that, as an indicia of good faith, the officer being willing to submit his work to someone else to review it.</text>

            <text syncTime="153.564" offset="720687">And I think these are additional factual circumstances that show at least the officer is trying to be careful, that this isn't something that's been -- been tossed off.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.302" offset="951609">Then let's go to the other two ways that I think you are asking us to overrule our precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.721" offset="973343">The first is using subjective information that a police officer knows, but hasn't disclosed in the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.762" offset="1009497">I'm having a little bit of difficulty understanding how an entire warrant regime that presumes that the magistrate has all pertinent information, and that's why you would be let off the hook, how you can excuse a police officer when he doesn't place that information in front of the magistrate?</text>

            <label>Mr. Timothy T. Coates</label>
            <text syncTime="249.092" offset="1102806">The way that has generally come up has not been in the validity of the warrant for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, but in terms of qualified immunity for the officer or exclusion of the evidence under -- or not -- or nonsuppression, rather, under the good faith exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.970" offset="1166336">And it's whether the officer, in light of the totality of the circumstances, might not have recognized that the warrant was deficient if the warrant otherwise isn't -- isn't bare-bones.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.743" offset="1205415">And I think -- Leon itself in footnote 23 incorporates the Harlow standard of totality of circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="286.467" offset="1252331">All it says is that this defendant is a member of a gang, but when the police officer is questioned, he is asked whether this crime at issue had any connection to his gang relationship and the answer was no.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.712" offset="1317324">So how is the request of the warrant to search for all gang-related indicia anything more than the general warrant that our Founding Fathers in part passed the Fourth Amendment against?</text>

            <text syncTime="339.551" offset="1464654">So it's not gang-related in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.270" offset="1475521">But I don't think that the gang membership is irrelevant to the investigation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.741" offset="1497360">You know, as we note and I think it is fairly recognized, gang members have the means to procure and use weapons beyond that of ordinary people.</text>

            <text syncTime="1188.300" offset="4859632">And the first paragraph which Justice Kagan supposes doesn't raise a problem and I'll -- to that assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.454" offset="4884292">It provides not only for searches of all firearms, but it provides and we think legitimately for searches of any receipts or paperwork showing the purchase, ownership or possession of the guns being sought.</text>

            <text syncTime="1208.278" offset="4939567">Because if you find photographs of an individual carrying a particular firearm, that's good evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.081" offset="4958793">So photographic evidence is within the scope of the first paragraph not just the second.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.950" offset="4974258">And so it does raise the question of whether the second paragraph increases the scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.169" offset="4987110">The other point I would raise in this respect is that in the second paragraph itself the anchor sentence in some respects in the second paragraph is the second sentence, which discusses not gang related indicia in particular but articles of personal property tending to establish the identity of persons and control of their premise or premises writ large.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.531" offset="5056596">And that provision has not been seen to have a problem associated with it thus far.</text>

            <text syncTime="1363.178" offset="5559192">Because the point in order to find the officers are liable in this situation, the officers would have to be so sure that probable cause is lacking that only a grossly incompetent magistrate could sign off on the probable cause assessment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1397.668" offset="5697118">And so I think there is room to import into the qualified immunity context these principles of good faith like for example, Mr. Chief Justice, the question of whether the officers in question asked superiors for their assessment of whether there is probable cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2379.781" offset="9625516">And the other point is, of course, relying on your superiors and on the D.A. is a double-edged sword in many cases, because that -- in fact, that can establish or go a long way towards establishing Monell liability, if you establish that there's a pattern of superiors and of deputy district attorneys--</text>

            <text syncTime="3056.232" offset="12331384">The first line of cases says if the police have reason, or have probable cause to look for a specific object, or specific -- even a specific kind of object, that doesn't give them probable cause to look for the whole generic class of objects that are somewhat similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.192" offset="12399198">The leading case on this in the Ninth Circuit is the Spilotro decision, but there are many cases coming both before and after that stand for that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.297" offset="12431590">The -- the principle has been applied in many contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.083" offset="12446741">For example, if you think somebody is committing fraud for years 1998 and 1999, and there are billing records, you can't -- you don't have probable cause to look for fraud, you know, for the entire records, billing records from 1950 to the present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.243" offset="12503374">If you think that -- if you see somebody run over somebody else in a green Nissan Sentra, you don't have probable cause to search for all vehicles including a red Ford -- a red Ford Explorer.</text>

            <label>Mr. Timothy T. Coates</label>
            <text syncTime="3508.807" offset="14141670">With respect to the -- the hypothetical that Justice Alito postulated in terms of finding other weapons there, and Respondents' counsel to say well, we might to on the plain view doctrine, I think these are circumstances in which we note that you want to encourage officers when they can, not to -- not rely on exceptions to the warrant requirement, and here if anything the officers in an abundance of caution attempted to get a warrant, contemplating those precise circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.878" offset="14265908">I don't think they should incur liability for -- for going to that extra step and that extra precaution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.432" offset="14288165">And again, a step back from whether there is actually probable cause, but whether a reasonable officer could even believe that might be the case for purposes of sending it to a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.955" offset="14326303">I think under those circumstances you want to encourage officers to seek a magistrate's determination and not try and rely on on-the-scene exceptions to the warrant requirement to try and justify seizing weapons under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.195" offset="14379175">With respect to Justice Scalia's concern about the probable cause to seize all guns as opposed to guns belonging to Bowen, and I think the notion is that Bowen, being a resident and that being established for purposes of this contention at this point, it's still down at district court but it was assumed for purposes of the Ninth Circuit that he was a resident -- that as a resident that he would have access to that firearm, and I think this was bolstered by a fact, again his status as a gang member, we cite the Chicago Housing Authority v. Rhodes case which talks about the manner in which gang members often store and use weapons at family members' homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.006" offset="14538418">I mean, it's an unfortunate part of -- of the gang culture, so it's not unreasonable for an officer to think there might be probable cause at the very least to seize any weapon found there, even if ultimately facts developed that it is in fact not Bowen's weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.516" offset="14596514">And this also goes to the indicia of gang membership and why it's reasonable even to ask, because that may be one of the means by which we could tie a particular weapon to Bowen depending upon what is found during the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.174" offset="14643116">This is a very high standard as established by this Court, which is essentially plainly incompetent or knowingly violating the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.410" offset="14676135">And this is an officer that has not hidden the ball with respect to what transpired between Bowen and Kelly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.916" offset="14706124">He submitted it to his superiors to look at; he submitted it to an attorney; and while that is not dispositive, I think those are objective facts that a reasonable officer could say, I have done this, this and this; there is no reason for me to believe that I am violating the law in sending it to a magistrate.</text>
