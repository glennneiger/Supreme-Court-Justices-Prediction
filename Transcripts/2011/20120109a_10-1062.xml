            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1062, Sackett v. the Environmental Protection Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.587" offset="136798">Mr. Schiff.</text>

            <label>Mr. Damien M. Schiff</label>
            <text syncTime="8.620" offset="140873">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.808" offset="153725">Mike and Chantell Sackett are here today because 4 years ago the Environmental Protection Agency issued against them a compliance order charging them with violations of the Clean Water Act, requiring that they restore their property to its alleged predisturbance wetlands condition, and imposing upon them the threat of tens of thousands of dollars per day in civil fines if they did not immediately comply with the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.939" offset="254245">But in these 4 years, the Sacketts have never been offered a meaningful opportunity for judicial review of the compliance order, an opportunity that they are guaranteed under the Due Process Clause and the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="50.933" offset="310147">Of course, there would have been a daily fine with or without the compliance order, wouldn't there, if they were indeed in violation of the -- the act.</text>

          <turn speaker="damien_m_schiff" startTime="59.622" stopTime="73.881">
            <label>Mr. Damien M. Schiff</label>
            <text syncTime="59.622" offset="344942">Justice Scalia, the fine would only have been attributable to the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.106" offset="362914">But with the compliance order in effect, essentially, the Sacketts are now subject to double liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.077" offset="382767">They can be held liable for the statute as well as for actions inconsistent with the compliance order.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="73.881" offset="401993">So, Mr. Schiff, your understanding is that each day your clients are subject to $37,500 of fines for the violation of the statute, and an additional 37.5 for violation of the compliance order?</text>
            <text syncTime="90.674" offset="469180">Is that the way you understand the penalty scheme to work?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Damien M. Schiff</label>
            <text syncTime="93.293" offset="479629">Yes -- yes, Justice Kagan.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.712" offset="485272">And it is -- it is in fact, I might add, how the EPA understands the penalty provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.280" offset="507528">In its brief at pages 30 and 31, they essentially concede that the existence of the compliance order does subject the Sacketts to liability for both violations of the statute as well as violations of the compliance order.</text>

          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="112.673" stopTime="133.253">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="112.673" offset="557160">But the court of appeals did say that there would be no independent liability under the -- for -- for violation of the compliance order.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.581" offset="604808">That is, unless there was a violation of the statute, there would be no penalty for violations of the compliance order.</text>

            <label>Mr. Damien M. Schiff</label>
            <text syncTime="133.253" offset="639498">That is correct, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.220" offset="647335">The court held that as a predicate for any liability for a compliance order violation, there must be first a finding of a statutory violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.809" offset="681712">But that doesn't change the fact, even according to the Ninth Circuit, doesn't change the fact that one can still be held liable for both, that there is a distinct civil liability that is traceable only to the compliance order.</text>

            <text syncTime="167.341" offset="775858">That might be a question that's reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.628" offset="792994">Do you seek more than that?</text>
            <text syncTime="174.414" offset="804070">Do you seek review at this stage of anything more than whether the property is subject to the act?</text>

            <label>Mr. Damien M. Schiff</label>
            <text syncTime="181.668" offset="833118">No, Your Honor, we seek review of that jurisdictional question as it is incorporated into the compliance order.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.337" offset="859763">The compliance order is the agency action for which we believe the Sacketts have a right of review under the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.510" offset="888498">And our challenge under the APA to the compliance order is precisely that there is no jurisdiction and therefore there has been no statutory violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.401" offset="940011">How would -- how would -- if you could write the opinion for the Court on this part of your case, what would the rule be?</text>
            <text syncTime="215.239" offset="967387">I mean, health inspectors go into restaurants all the time and say: Unless you fix this, I'm going to give you a citation.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.679" offset="1005108">And I am -- I'm wondering how your general theory or your general principle that you want us to adopt would fit with that rather routine type of enforcement?</text>

            <text syncTime="247.962" offset="1098313">All we are arguing is that the compliance order is a final agency action, it has stopped the Sacketts home building, it has imposed upon them significant civil liability, and therefore they should have a right under the APA--</text>

            <text syncTime="275.712" offset="1209281">It seems to me that -- that there's another distinction, a more significant one, between routine inspections by fire marshals or -- or restaurant inspectors, and that is that if you -- if you disobey their order, you're not subjected to any more substantial liability than -- than you would have been subjected to had they not issued the order.</text>

            <text syncTime="327.245" offset="1415440">If you don't comply, you know, we can bring an action any time to enforce this and you'll be subject to the statutory maximum, but during the period, the additional sanction for the -- under the administrative order, or the compliance order, is $10 a day?</text>

            <text syncTime="360.735" offset="1549396">I understood your argument to be that there was a significant extortion impact from the fact that these were such significant fines -- doubled, as you say -- that you could rack up for 5 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2505.883" offset="10129993">And then, just to be safe, they say that no permit application will be accepted unless the Corps determines that concurrent processing of an after-the-fact permit application is clearly appropriate, "clearly".</text>

            <text syncTime="3386.477" offset="13652344">The substantial evidence test applies to fact-finding made on a record, or a 556/557.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.449" offset="13680243">And so they'll have a hard time -- or a harder time -- in each of these cases subjecting it to judicial fact-finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.405" offset="13716083">And they think that the purpose of this, the purpose of this procedure given to them by statute was to call it -- the shots in favor of them, because there might be thousands of these things and they can't prepare all that formal thing.</text>
