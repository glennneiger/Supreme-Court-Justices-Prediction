            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">Justice Breyer has the opinion of the Court today in 10-6549, Reynolds versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.160" offset="133078">I will announce the opinion for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.132" offset="144886">The federal Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act requires those convicted of certain sex-related crimes to provide state governments with information such as names and current addresses for inclusion on state and federal sex offender registries.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.234" offset="213326">The Act includes pre-Act offenders among those whom it regulates, but it also says that the "Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the Act's registration requirements to sex offenders convicted before its enactment."</text>
            <text syncTime="46.571" offset="290649">The basic question before us arises out of facts and circumstances that are complex, but for purposes of this exposition, we can simplify the context with the following hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.918" offset="344043">A defendant is convicted of a sex crime before the Act becomes law.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.556" offset="362642">The Act then becomes law.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.543" offset="370584">The defendant subsequently fails to carry out the Act's requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.840" offset="387720">All of this takes place before the Attorney General has issued a rule that specifies that the Act applies to pre-Act offenders such as the defendant before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.568" offset="434636">These facts raise a legal question of whether the Act's requirement apply to pre-Act offenders who failed to comply with the Act's requirements in the period after the Act became law, but before the Attorney General validly specify the applicability of the Act to pre-Act offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.163" offset="513003">We conclude that the Act's requirements do not apply to this group of pre-Act offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.649" offset="539021">Our conclusion rests in part upon the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.585" offset="554695">We also note that a contrary reading will create uncertainties about just how the statute applies to pre-Act offenders, uncertainties that the Attorney General would be well suited to resolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.178" offset="605059">And we explain how our reading likely furthers various practical congressional objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.429" offset="626061">Our opinion discusses these and related matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.025" offset="640481">Now, as noted we hold that the relevant statutory requirements do not apply to pre-Act offenders prior to the time the Attorney General issued valid regulations specifying their applicability.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.260" offset="689486">We reverse a contrary holding by the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.520" offset="706518">Justice Scalia has issued a dissenting opinion which justice Ginsburg has joined.</text>
