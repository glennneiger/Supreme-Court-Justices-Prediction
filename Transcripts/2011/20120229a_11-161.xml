            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="109274">We will hear argument this morning in case 11-161, Armour v. City of Indianapolis.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.737" offset="140203">Mr. Stancil.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark T. Stancil</label>
            <text syncTime="9.289" offset="146368">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.658" offset="167893">The city chose a method for abandoning its sewer funding mechanism that left Petitioners paying 30 times more than their next door neighbors to connect to their neighborhood sewer project simply because Petitioners had paid their tax bills in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.317" offset="218466">Mere timing of payment does not render similarly situated taxpayers into similar groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.471" offset="243125">And that is particularly true here where the taxpayers are a discreetly defined group of homeowners sharing equally in a common specific benefit and State law specifically defines them as similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.279" offset="290355">The city's principal contention is that jettisoning the Barrett Law, they waived a fundity of initial taxation, was itself an end for this justification and itself justified the gross disparity imposed on Petitioner -- on Petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.289" offset="350332">That does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.622" offset="351690">The fact that an arbitrary classification may yield a desirable result does not render it any less arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.525" offset="375305">The city must have a reason for drawing the distinction; but paying ones taxes in good faith does not equal treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.612" offset="407697">Indeed State law here makes clear that delaying payment by choosing an installment plan does not put a taxpayer on special footing.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.516" offset="435282">For example, the Barrett Law declares that installment payments</text>
            <text syncTime="85.301" offset="450433">"shall be collected in the same manner as other taxes. "</text>
            <text syncTime="88.436" offset="462972">and installment payments are automatically secured by a lien against the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.490" offset="479168">Taxpayers who select the installment plan, which they may do for any reason or no reason whatsoever; and in fact, if they make no choice, they default into the installment plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.728" offset="512082">They are required, if the city asks as it did here, to sign an agreement, agreeing to pay the installments in full with interest and not to contest the validity of the underlying assessment.</text>

            <text syncTime="114.237" offset="566208">Your adversary raises a point that concerns me, which is what happens to all other amnesty programs like parking ticket amnesties?</text>
            <text syncTime="126.295" offset="614378">And if you take your logic to an extreme, how about something that doesn't involve money but immigration status amnesty, illegal aliens who can apply for citizenship and be forgiven their illegal entry?</text>

            <text syncTime="155.230" offset="730152">For starters, this Court's equal protection and rational bases cases in particular make clear context is key.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.801" offset="752409">So forgiving a penalty imposed on a speeder, for example, who has an overdue ticket or parking ticket is qualitatively different judgment than forgiving the underlying tax liability broad--</text>

            <text syncTime="179.060" offset="825447">So you are suggesting that there is a difference between that and this case where the government is basically saying, you owe me something and I'm going to forgive you what you owe me?</text>

            <text syncTime="190.084" offset="869542">The Chief Justice's opinion in Engquist took that specific example on, not with you in mind presumably, but took that example on specifically and it said: This is the kind of action itself that is inherently a subjective individualized determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.544" offset="927429">It's not irrational to pull over one traffic violator and not another because that's the nature of the enforcement action.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.448" offset="958985">That is qualitatively different from a tax imposed on 181 homeowners who live next door to each other, and then 12 months later saying, you know, 31 of you are going to pay 30 times as much in reality as the other 150, even though--</text>

            <text syncTime="1710.395" offset="6950848">Now, I think it's Justice Kagan was suggesting, if you now create a rule that says when they do forgive, they actually have to provide refunds and face equal protection clause violations, then in the future nobody is going to ever forgive.</text>

            <text syncTime="2793.695" offset="11284040">So the -- and this is -- with respect I think part of the problem with the Allegheny Pittsburgh, in particularly this extension of it, you are putting so much weight on the State law, and it gets you in this business of flyspecking the Barrett Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.205" offset="11342032">I mean -- you know, this -- I mean, Justice Thomas made this point very well in the Nordlinger case that there is an anomaly here, which is you looking -- supposed to be looking at Federal law and the violation seems to be tied to potentially a violation of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.697" offset="11396053">If I could focus on that for a minute, because this is another really important difference between Allegheny Pittsburgh and this case, which speaks right to the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.434" offset="11422907">In Allegheny Pittsburgh, it's a facially neutral statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.403" offset="11434818">And so it would be an anomaly there to say that when there's a facially neutral statute, you're going to invalidate the -- the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.724" offset="11464076">The statute's fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.492" offset="11467210">The problem is, you've been assessed at 100 percent, everybody else has been assessed at 50 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.444" offset="11486959">The Court in that unique context says, you know, there's no obligation to go and sort of mandamus the assessor, to bring everybody else up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.134" offset="11517783">You get to sort of go back to that level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.984" offset="11525202">This is very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.119" offset="11529695">The challenge here, like in Nordlinger, is a challenge to a distinction drawn in a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.240" offset="11550175">Resolution 101, unlike the law in Allegheny Pittsburgh, is not facially neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.691" offset="11572014">It draws a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.226" offset="11578178">So the relevant question is the rationality of that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.761" offset="11592285">Is it rational?</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.628" offset="11595733">We submit there are multiple reasons why it is rational.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.332" offset="11610570">But if you disagree with me, the obvious remedy is to strike down the statute, or at least remand to the State court with express instructions that they have the option, which is exactly what happened in the sex discrimination cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.640" offset="11659785">And Justice Scalia, if you're worried about incentives and standing, look at Heckler v. Mathews.</text>

            <text syncTime="2895.211" offset="11690087">And what the Court said is standing is based on your right to guarantee equal treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.615" offset="11711716">Whether or not it's a pocketbook injury, you have standing if you're denied equal treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2909.153" offset="11745885">But they can get equal treatment restored just as easily by Resolution 101 being invalidated in full as they can by getting an additional windfall by getting a refund.</text>

            <text syncTime="3439.102" offset="13865669">To me, this is a case about transition rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.004" offset="13877267">All legislation creates classes of citizens and some are -- and puts them all in a group, and says you are going to be treated in the same way as long as this legislation exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.181" offset="13929930">And then a legislature comes along and changes that piece of legislation, and different people are affected differently by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.119" offset="13965666">And to me what you are suggesting is that when that break is made and when that transition occurs, the -- I don't know how you would apply the rule that you were suggesting, which is that everybody in the former class has to be treated the same as a matter of transition policy.</text>
