            <text syncTime="9.036" offset="143569">This case concerns the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act or ISDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.890" offset="175020">ISDA allows tribes to provide services like law enforcement or education that otherwise would have been provided by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.792" offset="214622">ISDA directs the Secretary to enter into contracts with willing tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.086" offset="235833">Under those contracts, tribes commit to providing these services and the Government computes to paying tribes for the full costs of providing the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.743" offset="278465">ISDA requires the Secretary to promise to pay the full amount of contract support cost for each tribe's contract, but each contact is made subject to the availability of appropriations.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.643" offset="338024">From 1994 to 2001, various tribes entered into ISDA contracts with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.282" offset="372611">Each year, Congress appropriated more than enough money so that the Secretary could have paid any individual tribe the amount of contract support cost that tribe was due.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.090" offset="423811">Congress did not appropriate enough money, however, to allow the Secretary to pay all tribes in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.532" offset="453590">Instead, the Secretary paid each tribe only some, but not all of the amount specified by each tribe's contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.760" offset="490475">The tribes, unsatisfied, sued for breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.155" offset="508134">The question presented in this case is whether on these facts the Government is obligated to pay the tribes the full amount of contract support costs specified by their contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.306" offset="560692">The District Court found that the Government was not obligated to pay tribes more in the aggregate than the total amount that Congress had appropriated.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.484" offset="597368">A divided panel of the Tenth Circuit reversed holding the charge were entitled to be paid in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.005" offset="627461">For the reasons we explain more fully in our opinion filed today, we now affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.083" offset="659749">When Congress appropriates a lump sum of money to an agency, the agency generally has discretion to allocate those funds as it sees fit, consistent with any limitations in the appropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.063" offset="715755">Here, Congress appropriated a large some of money that could have been used by the Secretary to pay any tribe's contract support costs in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.043" offset="759641">At that point, under long established principles of Government contracting law, the Government's promise to pay became binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.957" offset="799347">It is true that in this case the Secretary entered into more contracts than he could afford to honor in full, but when a Government agency enters into more contracts that it can afford to pay, the risk of over obligation generally falls on the Government, not on the contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.515" offset="877505">The Government advances a number of arguments for why this ordinary rule does not apply to ISDA, but we find them unpersuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.707" offset="914286">To the extent that there is any ambiguity, Congress specified in ISDA that these ambiguities be resolved in favor of the tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.154" offset="952111">As a result, the tribes are entitled to recover for breach of contract from the judgment awarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.161" offset="980114">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.078" offset="995788">The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Alito have joined.</text>
