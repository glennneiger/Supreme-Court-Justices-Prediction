            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="5.312" offset="125659">Today the Court issues two opinions on the same subject, both concern clams of ineffective assistance of counsel in the context of plea bargaining and the first case to be announced is Missouri versus Frye and the second is Lafler versus Cooper.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.913" offset="188040">In the first case, Mr. Frye was arrested for driving without a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.940" offset="212177">An offer of a plea bargain was mailed to his counsel and in it, the prosecutor offered to recommend a 90-day sentence if Frye pled guilty, but Frye's counsel did not tell him about the offer and the offer expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.627" offset="270900">Frye later pled guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.869" offset="275916">He received a three-year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.864" offset="283857">It was his fourth conviction for driving without a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.056" offset="296605">In post conviction proceedings in the Missouri state court, Frye claimed ineffective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.834" offset="319697">He argued he would have accepted the prosecutor's offer of a plea bargain had he known about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.259" offset="337460">The state trial court denied the post conviction motion, but the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed, this Court grant of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.323" offset="369643">It is well established that criminal defendants have the right to effective assistance of counsel at critical stages of the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.505" offset="398378">Among these critical stages is the consideration of a plea bargain offered by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.014" offset="420425">Few would doubt that a defense attorney has a responsibility to tell his client about a prosecutor's formal offer of a plea bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.884" offset="451981">So, there seems to be agreement among the parties to this case that counsel's performance was deficient, but in arguing that relief should be denied, the State points out, there is no right to a plea bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.253" offset="501405">That's true, but it is also true that nearly 95% of convictions result from a plea of bargain to a significant degree then -- then.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.431" offset="538081">Today's criminal justice system is a system of plea bargains and this Court is unwilling to say that within that system, counsel's performance does not matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.822" offset="579668">Now, this does not mean that the respondent, Frye, will necessarily obtain relief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.914" offset="600043">Once ineffective assistance of counsel has been shown, the defendant must still show prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.362" offset="621881">The standard for prejudice is set out in Strickland versus Washington, an earlier case from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.686" offset="643093">Under the Strickland test, even after showing ineffective assistance, the defendant must show there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different and that he was injured as a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.648" offset="695024">On freeman -- on remand, Frye would have the opportunity to attempt to make that showing and that task will not be an easy one.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.471" offset="726267">That's because less than a week before the first opportunity for the trial court to enter any plea bargain, in other words, even if the plea bargain had been communicated, the trial judge still had to approve it and a week before that, Frye was arrested for once again driving without a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.168" offset="797111">In light of that new offense, there is reason to doubt that the prosecution would have adhered to the agreement or that the trial court would have accepted it unless the state law somehow required performance once Frye accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.453" offset="850192">It's appropriate for the Missouri Court of Appeals to address this question in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.823" offset="867641">The judgment of the Missouri Court of Appeals is vacated and the case is remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.053" offset="884569">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion, in which the Chief Justice, Justice Thomas and Justice Alito join.</text>
