            <text syncTime="12.224" offset="156846">When determining whether an error affects substantial rights pursuant to the harmless-error statute, courts should first begin the analysis with the error itself, consider it in the context of the entire record, determine what potential impact it may have, and then ask the question: Can the government prove to the requisite degree of certitude -- in this case, fair assurance -- that the error did not substantially impact the verdict of the jury that heard the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="45.695" offset="290802">It is impermissible for the reviewing court to merely ask the question of whether some other jury, a reasonable jury that didn't hear the error that this jury heard, would convict him and determine harmlessness on that basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="67.024" offset="376065">I just don't see where in the opinion -- I have the opinion of the court of appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="77.130" offset="416503">It didn't use the magic words -- and it started out with, let's look at the big picture, and it said: Well, here's the defense he elected to put on, and this is a tough sell because.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.605" offset="462374">But then it quotes what happens with the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.890" offset="471569">It -- and it -- it ends its analysis for saying we -- this evidence would have moved the jury to convict Vasquez without a nudge from anything it heard in the government's case.</text>

            <text syncTime="108.499" offset="541995">--Before the harmless-error analysis, the question the Court asks is, what we have to decide is whether a reasonable jury would convict him absent the error.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.605" offset="582433">And so the question that they ask doesn't require any consideration of the error.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.259" offset="601032">And the conclusion they reach that he would be convicted without any consideration of the error also doesn't consider the error.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.913" offset="627677">They do not address the error or its impact at all, despite a robust dissent which set forth the extraordinary prejudicial possible impact of this error.</text>

            <text syncTime="146.189" offset="692774">I see -- and you can add another -- three potential things about these calls or three potential errors: One, that they proved as a matter of fact that she was biased.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.884" offset="763513">But, as the majority points out, she already said she was before the tapes were played.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.388" offset="789531">So whatever error may have been occasioned by the jury using the tapes as for the truth, it really was cumulative to an already admitted bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.381" offset="837492">The second is some sort of ambiguous statement by her that all of them were in trouble, meaning all the defendants, and a similar statement by the Petitioner's lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.740" offset="906978">So what was it that was error that affected or influenced the jury among these three choices?</text>

            <text syncTime="227.677" offset="1018678">They didn't reference that specific statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.927" offset="1023693">It was referenced three times in the cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.044" offset="1032157">When the witness suggested that it -- who was going to lose the case only referred to her husband, the government corrected her and said, no, it was everyone, and then they played the tape to make that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.316" offset="1069251">They also played a portion of a recording where it said that counsel was talking to Mr. Vasquez about pleading guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.320" offset="1097254">Now, if you take those two statements together for their truth, what they mean is that counsel believes he's guilty and was telling him he should plead that way.</text>

            <text syncTime="894.717" offset="3686825">If I ask the question whether an error altered the verdict, it seems to me I am asking pretty much the same question as whether without that verdict the -- whether without that error, the verdict would be the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="1609.877" offset="6547546">So let me give you a hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.027" offset="6556114">Let's say that this jury was not out for eight hours, but was out for eight days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.031" offset="6576072">And on the seventh day a note came from the jury, and the note said: We really think that these tape recordings are extremely important, but we're -- we're having a dispute about how important they are, and we would like to listen to them again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.641" offset="6638557">And they do that, and then they come back with this compromise verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.711" offset="6662798">Now, what you're suggesting is that we cannot look at any of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.681" offset="6682756">Essentially, the best proof that's available to us about whether the error in fact affected this jury's decision, you would have a court close its eyes to.</text>

            <text syncTime="1663.345" offset="6761332">I think as a general matter our view is that indications mid-deliberation of what a jury might or some subset of the jury might be considering is generally very unreliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.502" offset="6817966">And that in your case, the Court shouldn't shut its eyes to that question, but what it should do is redirect the court back to the evidence that was before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.044" offset="6860180">Because if we are assuming a rational jury, there often is some correspondence; it should be an indication to go back and look again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.364" offset="6885466">If the Court were to conclude, wow, the evidence was so overwhelming, so overwhelming that no rational jury would have, you know, had a problem with convicting absent the error, it's very unlikely that the situation that your hypothetical poses would result.</text>

            <text syncTime="3047.447" offset="12297829">Mr. Yang, you may be taking a harder position than you really need to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.251" offset="12312980">Why shouldn't the rule be that the -- the appellate court should look at what would be done by a rational jury, except in the kind of extraordinary circumstances that have been posited by Justice Kagan's hypothetical and a few of the other questions, simply because it's so difficult to determine what a -- what the jury was actually doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.914" offset="12399602">We have a rule that prohibits consideration of what goes on in the jury room.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.235" offset="12420918">But suppose we didn't have that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3086.222" offset="12452891">If that were the case, then surely the rule would be what would this jury have done?</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.459" offset="12473789">But most of the time, it's just speculation to tell what a jury -- what they did -- did they come back quickly?</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.863" offset="12495419">Well, that shows that this evidence was so bad that it caused them to render a quick verdict in what otherwise would have been a difficult case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3427.175" offset="13816692">I first want to address Neder, which the government counsel continually referenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.881" offset="13855562">Neder talks about the reasonable jury, but Neder also limits itself to situations where the evidence is uncontroverted and inconvertible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.404" offset="13885656">I think because in those situations the difference between the reasonable jury and this jury would be deemed to be nonexistent, because it would be impossible for the error to have an impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.577" offset="13918256">Secondly, I think it's important to note from Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical, if you don't consider the error, then even that extreme case, that would have to be ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.800" offset="13967158">And so I think the government's formulation, and the formulation used by the appellate court below, would justify -- would lead to that bad conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.871" offset="13999445">I also think that when you do that formulation, where you are talking about the reasonable jury and absence of error, the reason those cases come out different is because those courts think they don't have to address the error, which is I think what happened in the majority below, why they didn't address it despite the dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.000" offset="14064020">The other thing I think is important to note is, the reason you have to look at the error and its possible impact and not just whether you could be convicted on the other evidence is because you say, well, he could be convicted on the other evidence; if that's all that you are saying and -- and it's not -- on the -- evidence which could independently in this case could be a reason to convict, then I think you are making that guilt determination that this Court says is not supposed to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.913" offset="14151687">And I think the majority's opinion below is consistent with that approach and there's nothing in it to suggest that's not exactly what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.602" offset="14178436">I also think that in the end, there was a mention of a limiting instruction; a limiting instruction would have cured this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.089" offset="14204349">We assume juries would follow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.539" offset="14210201">That means they wouldn't concluded that his lawyer thought him guilty and then put Mrs. Perez on the stand and concluded she wasn't telling the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.843" offset="14235383">What this error allows, what if taken for its truth a jury could believe that he confessed to his lawyer, they could disregard everything that was said on his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.650" offset="14278642">They could say we know that he is guilty; his lawyers knew he was guilty; we can convict him on that basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="3631.958" offset="14635788">This Court has never overruled Kotteakos, and to focus on it allows a guilt determination by a reviewing court that would be violative of the Sixth Amendment that this Court was concerned about in Kotteakos, that this Court was concerned about in Sullivan, that this Court was even concerned about in Neder, outside the scope of cases where the evidence is uncontestable.</text>
