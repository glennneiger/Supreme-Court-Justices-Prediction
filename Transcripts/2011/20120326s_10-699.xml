            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="107520">I have the opinion of the Court this morning in case 10-699, Zivotofsky versus Clinton.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.247" offset="136464">In 2002, Congress passed a law providing that an American citizen born in Jerusalem may choose to have his place of birth listed as Israel on his passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.704" offset="182335">Menachem Binyamin Zivotofsky was born in Jerusalem shortly after the law went into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.552" offset="209711">He was an American citizen because his parents were.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.722" offset="222354">His mother applied for a passport for her son and said she wanted Israel listed as his place of birth as the law allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.504" offset="253492">The State Department refused her request and issued the boy a passport listing only Jerusalem as his place of birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.977" offset="283376">It was and remains State Department policy not to follow the statute allowing Israel to be listed as the place of birth on the ground that the law interferes with the President's Foreign Affairs power.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.235" offset="336457">Zivotofsky's sued the Secretary of State in federal court here in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.410" offset="361117">The Secretary responded that the Court should stay out of the matter, arguing that it presented a political question beyond the authority of the Judicial Branch to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.955" offset="399256">The lower courts agreed with that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.859" offset="410854">We granted Zivotofsky's petition for review and now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.098" offset="431856">In general, of course, the judiciary has a responsibility to decide cases properly before it even those, as Chief Justice Marshall put it 200 years ago, that it would gladly avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.053" offset="483683">Our precedence however, recognized a narrow exception to that rule known as a political question doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.412" offset="513149">Under that doctrine, a court lacks the authority to decide a case if it, one, involves a question that the Constitution has clearly committed to another branch to decide or two, if there are no judicially manageable standards for courts to use in deciding it.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.905" offset="587128">The lower courts thought that Zivotofsky's case presented such a political question because it asked the courts to decide the political status of Jerusalem, but it does not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.286" offset="636656">The question for the Court to decide is instead whether the State Department is required to follow the 2002 law that gives Zivotofsky the right to have Israel recorded as his place of birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.707" offset="690260">The Secretary of State argues that the law is unconstitutional because there is in the Constitution an exclusive commitment to the President of the power to recognize foreign governments, but there is no such exclusive commitment to the Executive of the authority to determine the constitutionality of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.071" offset="771762">Zivotofsky claims that the law is a valid exercise of Congress' own powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.730" offset="794436">Deciding which party is correct is well within our authority and, as we put it in one of our prior cases, we cannot avoid the duty to decide such a question simply because the issues have political implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.660" offset="854100">In addition, there is no absence of judicially manageable standards for resolving this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.378" offset="876983">Both Zivotofskys and the Secretary of State offered detailed, textual, structural, and historical arguments about the constitutionality of this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.451" offset="921287">Evaluating those arguments is a familiar judicial exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.838" offset="942811">For these reasons we hold that the lower courts should not have avoided deciding this case because in their view it presented a political question.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.670" offset="978129">Given that error, the lower courts never reached the merits of Zivotofsky's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.847" offset="998818">We generally do not decide questions that were not decided below.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.261" offset="1016477">We, therefore, send the case back to the lower courts to exercise jurisdiction and to decide the merits of Zivotofsky's claim in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.042" offset="1055660">Justice Sotomayor has filed and opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment in which Justice Breyer joined as to part one.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.210" offset="1088261">Justice Alito has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.159" offset="1104144">Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
