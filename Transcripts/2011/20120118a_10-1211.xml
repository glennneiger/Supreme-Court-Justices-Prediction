            <text syncTime="8.270" offset="140539">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.472" offset="153391">As the government concedes, INA subsection 101(a)(13)(C)(v) added by IIRIRA does not expressly mandate retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.263" offset="192470">Under Landgraf, applying that new provision would attach new legal consequences to pre-IIRIRA offenses, penalizing both those who travel and those who don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.619" offset="229982">Covered lawful permanent residents could not visit their parents abroad without being forced to abandon their children here.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.123" offset="256000">They would be removed from the country or else confined here.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.658" offset="270106">Either way, they would lose an ability they had under pre-IIRIRA law based on pre-IIRIRA offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.397" offset="297064">Thus applying the subsection to them would be impermissibly retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.533" offset="313574">The settled expectations at issue here are those of round trips by lawful permanent residents, not, as the government would put it, one-way tickets or first-time entrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.323" offset="356728">These are people who have structured their lives here.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.458" offset="369267">They have homes, spouses, children, and careers here, and yet have a settled expectation that they will be able to maintain ties to visit aged and ailing parents abroad, to go to funerals and wakes and visit them in the hospital and surgeries.</text>

            <text syncTime="117.408" offset="577097">That is not the same as the automatic ability to travel, and in fact in this case the discretionary relief was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.062" offset="599667">It depends on a different set of factors from the automatic pre-IIRIRA ability to travel.</text>

            <text syncTime="153.398" offset="721084">Second, the right time to look at expectations is the moment before the law is enacted: Does one have an expectation at that point that one will be able to continue--</text>

            <text syncTime="162.187" offset="756193">You are concerned under Landgraf, I think, with whether or not it disrupts settled expectations, and it just doesn't seem to me that this issue enters into the expectations at all when the pertinent act, which is the commission of the crime, not the pleading guilty, takes place.</text>

            <text syncTime="187.237" offset="856398">The discrimination there had been illegal for decades, yet adding a new form of damages to it was impermissibly retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.241" offset="884402">In Hughes Aircraft, filing false claims with the government had been illegal for years, yet broadening the class of people who could file suit and removing a defense -- no reliance possible at all, but there was a settled expectation that there would be no additional consequences attached to that.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.289" offset="1264640">You do not cite, the government cites but does not discuss the relevant portion of a -- of a later case which involved the same question, Republic of Austria v. Altmann.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.049" offset="1323677">I concurred separately in Landgraf because I thought that the test that the Court was using, upsetting settled expectations, was indeed the proper test for constitutional provisions forbidding ex post facto laws, which is where the Court derived it from, Justice Story's opinion in a New Hampshire constitutional case.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.830" offset="1418762">But I said in my concurrence that the proper test for -- for the other issue of retroactivity, namely, constitutionality aside, does this statute mean to be applied only in the future or in the past?</text>
            <text syncTime="345.959" offset="1491278">And for that I propose -- well, I'll read you what we said in Altmann:</text>
            <text syncTime="351.127" offset="1511967">"Our approach" -- which postdates Landgraf.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.597" offset="1533806">"Our approach to retroactivity in this case thus parallels that advanced by Justice Scalia in the concurrence in Landgraf. "</text>
            <text syncTime="363.937" offset="1563167">Quote, and it's quoting the concurrence:</text>
            <text syncTime="366.705" offset="1574243">"The critical issue is not whether the rule affects vested rights or governs substance or procedure, but rather what is the relevant activity that the rule regulates. "</text>

            <text syncTime="407.014" offset="1735576">And that is what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.816" offset="1742681">The -- the event that is sought to be regulated is entry into the United States, and it is clear that this statute applies only to prospective entry into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.142" offset="1800046">It doesn't apply to past entry so that those people who came in, in violation of this statute can be deported.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephanos Bibas</label>
            <text syncTime="510.198" offset="2148310">Your Honor, there are five pertinent distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.449" offset="2157296">Permit me to unpack.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.718" offset="2162312">The first and most important is that the Landgraf test should have a broader scope than the ex post facto context in these criminal cases because Congress can override it expressly.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.857" offset="2206929">Since the ex post facto clauses disable both State and Federal legislatures from acting at all, the deprivation of the power must be narrow and careful so State and Federal legislatures can continue to regulate felon in possession or racketeering or the other crimes the government advances.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.786" offset="2270563">But Landgraf just tells Congress how to legislate.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.821" offset="2282789">It's a background rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.038" offset="2287595">So it's legitimate to have a presumption against retroactivity sweep more broadly, as Congress is free to override it and, as I will explain, does override it regularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.609" offset="2321868">Secondly, felon in possession is inherently dangerous conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.330" offset="2340780">This is a protective law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3039.872" offset="12266998">The statute here is triggered by the post-enactment conduct of entering the country, but also by the -- the pre-enactment conduct of committing the crime.</text>

          <turn speaker="stephanos_bibas" startTime="3068.975" stopTime="3344.087">
            <label>Mr. Stephanos Bibas</label>
            <text syncTime="3068.975" offset="12383399">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.208" offset="12388310">I would like to make five points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.843" offset="12394789">The first one is the statute is poorly tailored to any protective or forward-looking effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.530" offset="12425613">As the Court has noted, its perverse effect is to discourage people from leaving the country, to keep them in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.767" offset="12450586">So any idea that the purpose is to get them out doesn't square with the way the statute is written.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.255" offset="12472529">As Justice Ginsburg noted, while the post-IIRIRA innocent travel may be the trigger here, the obvious target is the pre-IIRIRA offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.427" offset="12505130">The statute is tied to misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.529" offset="12513593">The natural inference of making this conduct not just a piece of evidence but a prerequisite is that it is the misconduct that is being penalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.300" offset="12544627">Second, the impact we suggest is the relevant test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.853" offset="12562913">The impact is a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.836" offset="12570854">It is a disability based on a past act that Mr. Vartelas is now helpless to undo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.026" offset="12595618">That is all that is required under Landgraf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.759" offset="12606485">If Congress thinks it important, it can expressly require retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.280" offset="12620591">But it hasn't done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.563" offset="12625711">Third, let me make clear that we have alternative theories here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.682" offset="12642220">Reliance is something that makes the case worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.200" offset="12652251">It is something that exacerbates the problem, makes it obvious and severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.588" offset="12669806">And our amici, the NACDL brief, points out very movingly how important these kinds of considerations are in immigrants' decisions to plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.594" offset="12701884">Here for example, my client received a 4-month discount off his sentencing range.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.661" offset="12722155">It's entirely plausible to believe that immigrants in his situation might value the ability to stay in the same country with their 4-year-old and 2-year-old child as much as 4 months in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.036" offset="12767608">But our broader theory is that the violation of settled expectations is sufficient whether or not there is reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.723" offset="12794358">The settled expectations that one has of planning one's life in this country and yet having relatives abroad one will tend to or care for their business, etcetera, that is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.165" offset="12836153">Just as in Landgraf and Hughes Aircraft Company there were no legally cognizable reliance interests in discriminating or in submitting false claims, but changing the penalty is enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.955" offset="12879308">Fourth, this Court's decision in St. Cyr I believe strongly helps our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.524" offset="12901564">The first reason is that it imposed a disability, a disability on filing in the future for discretionary relief, but as a practical matter it is burdening past conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.048" offset="12939703">Secondly, St. Cyr didn't purport to change the holdings in Landgraf and Hughes Aircraft Company that those are other ways of showing impermissible retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.986" offset="12971363">The logic in St. Cyr is ineluctable that because you are burdening a decision, a decision that, as the Court and the amici in St. Cyr noted, matters greatly and factors into the plea bargaining calculus, that the retroactivity is especially obvious and severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.899" offset="13051089">And let me note that St. Cyr was decided under this same statute, a privilege, not a right, a privilege that Congress can abrogate at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.071" offset="13083794">That did not influence this Court's holding at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.857" offset="13094870">The right-privilege distinction is dead in this area of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.159" offset="13108140">If there is a privilege under IIRIRA to apply for discretionary relief, there is a privilege to not be subject to the disability on one's traveling and returning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.950" offset="13151295">Finally, let me talk about the criminal-civil line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.933" offset="13159236">My my brother here introduced Smith v. Doe and mentioned some of the sex offender cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.771" offset="13178567">I've explained why the criminal cases in ex post facto are different, but let me go into some more detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.507" offset="13201450">The Court is well familiar with Smith v. Doe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.042" offset="13211585">That was a civil case that Doe attempted to turn into a criminal case under the very demanding standard in Kennedy v. Mendoza.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.632" offset="13245962">But that's a very uphill fight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.832" offset="13254844">As the Court's opinion recognized, the court must be very deferential before turning something facially civil into criminal because then it's categorically forbidden and it comes with the criminal procedure protections in the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.890" offset="13303014">That's not what we are doing now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.492" offset="13309388">We are not trying to say this law is forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.527" offset="13317538">Smith v. Doe involved a law where the court's opinion said on its face: The legislature made it retroactive; it says it's retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.114" offset="13347944">Federal law SORNA is expressly retroactive in section 113(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.084" offset="13367798">IIRIRA is expressly retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.269" offset="13376575">That's a different inquiry, where you're asking does the Ex Post Facto Clause forbids something that is expressly retroactive, does Mendoza-Martinez turn it into a criminal case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.292" offset="13412624">Versus here, where it's not retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.177" offset="13424222">All Congress has to do is spell it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.796" offset="13434671">If this Court adheres to its previous jurisprudence, the guidance to the drafters across the street is clear: Just draft the statutes the way you have always been doing it, say before, on, or after effective date.</text>

            <text syncTime="3387.031" offset="13655562">This Court decided Landgraf 2 decades ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.566" offset="13665698">A few years after Landgraf, Congress passed IIRIRA in 1996.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.553" offset="13689731">IIRIRA contains express retroactivity provisions that go hand in glove with the Landgraf presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.140" offset="13716062">And then Congress passed SORNA, to which my brother alludes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.761" offset="13730482">SORNA in 2005 likewise in Section 113(d) says: Yes, this sex offender registration shall apply, the Attorney General can apply it to people with pre-SORNA convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.302" offset="13776666">Congress understands the Landgraf presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.402" offset="13785025">In those statutes and others it has legislated against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.371" offset="13796937">It can continue to do it because this Court should continue to use its traditional tools--</text>

            <text syncTime="3426.658" offset="13814073">Well, that can be explained because Congress understands that, who knows whether it's going to be held to be retroactive or not; if you surely want it to apply you better say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.530" offset="13853571">If that's the rule you want us to adopt, that's okay.</text>
