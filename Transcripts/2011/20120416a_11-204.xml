            <text syncTime="8.070" offset="140134">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="10.356" offset="149329">In the Fair Labor Standards Act, Congress directed the Secretary of Labor to quote/unquote "define and delimit" the statute's outside salesmen exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.045" offset="180049">By regulation, the Secretary provided that an outside salesman is one who makes sales rather than promoting sales by others.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.031" offset="212023">In further guidance, the Secretary elaborated that nonexempt promotion includes either, one, a conversation where there can be no commitment or, two, one where there would be no exchange with the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.106" offset="260297">Now, everyone agrees that a pharmaceutical detailer engages in promotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.077" offset="276180">They tout drugs to doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.477" offset="281822">Everyone agrees that there can't be a commitment to issue a prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.231" offset="296869">Everyone agrees that a prescription is not an exchange with a pharmaceutical company.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.099" offset="312333">But nonetheless, the Respondent argues that pharmaceutical detailers sell drugs directly to doctors as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.587" offset="342217">They say that follows from the fact that the Secretary's regulation incorporates the definition of FLSA, which is in the blue brief in the appendix at page 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.977" offset="383804">That definition, which is section 203(k), provides -- it's the second provision on the page --</text>
            <text syncTime="79.785" offset="427063">""sale" or "sell" includes any sale, exchange, contract to sell, consignment for sale, shipment for sale, or other disposition. "</text>
            <text syncTime="90.224" offset="468754">And what you will not find in that language is anything that contradicts the two points the Secretary has made, which is that there has to be a commitment or that at the very least, there has to be an exchange with the employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1942.328" offset="7877185">So what they are trying to do is really distinguishing not between pitchmen and sales people, but between what they refer to as missionary men or people who pave the way for somebody else to make the sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="2244.710" offset="9086759">One is to say obviously that may depend a little bit on how the particular role was described.</text>

            <text syncTime="2306.633" offset="9334400">One is we are told that in the early years, at least, before there were regulations restricting the sale of prescription drugs, that these detailers did two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.560" offset="9398139">They did have their informational function, but they also did direct sales to pharmaceutical companies, to hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.498" offset="9429904">So for at least 20 years of those 70 years these people were engaged in what the department would call sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.604" offset="9474312">So that's suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.508" offset="9493956">And then when we have the commitment, the opinion letter that says: We have a category for these people; they are engaged in instruction, in information; they are not engaged in sales; but because they are so independent, we rank them as administrative -- in the particular case we rank them as administrative people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.672" offset="9578593">So it's not as though there was a sudden about-face as you suggest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3226.741" offset="13014844">Then the doctor reads some medical journals; then maybe the doctor goes to a convention and talks to other doctors about the product.</text>

            <text syncTime="3263.215" offset="13160712">Then maybe on the final visit, after all that information is there, finally the detailer gets the commitment to prescribe to appropriate patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.884" offset="13191432">I think one way to think about the absurdity of making the difference turn on the prescription is to compare this salesperson to another salesperson of medical devices who goes in, but these are medical supplies that the doctor uses in the doctor's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.711" offset="13250782">Now, they're both hired for their sales experience, they both get sales training, they both have a sales territory.</text>

            <text syncTime="3349.820" offset="13507200">--Well, Justice Scalia, you heard the government's explanation and, as you suggest, if the government's explanation is right, then this shouldn't be a matter of just trying to limit things to -- to the 3(k) definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.644" offset="13554429">I think, even though -- at the 3(k) definition, though, if you look at that definition, it has every hallmark of being broad and functional and flexible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.317" offset="13585149">I would want to make one very important point, though, about the ultimate question here, because ultimately the decision whether to go one way or another on this issue has remarkable significance for retroactive imposition of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.225" offset="13640842">We all know that retroactive rulemaking is disfavored.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.760" offset="13654949">Well, think about the consequences here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.696" offset="13662681">You have massive liability, between 4 and 6 years of effective time and a half, because of the way that the statute works.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.134" offset="13692460">It has time and a half plus liquidated damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.753" offset="13702909">You are talking about people who are very well paid, close to six figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.121" offset="13720359">So unlike the classic worker who you might think is covered by the FLSA, who is a relatively low hourly worker, the amounts of damages here are quite significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.077" offset="13760170">Of course, the effort to try to reconstruct these people's hours, given that they were told they were exempt and they were outside the office, trying to reconstruct how many overtime hours they actually worked is going to be a crapshoot at best.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.035" offset="13804055">So if you think about all of that, and then you think about, as Justice Breyer indicated, the other option, which is to--</text>

            <text syncTime="3476.532" offset="14013975">And partly my instinct is get somebody to decide this other than a lawyer in the Department of Labor, because this is a hard question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3495.696" offset="14090671">And I don't agree with you, overturn Auer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3582.768" offset="14438935">Three quick points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.754" offset="14442906">First, if you read the transcript, you will see that my friend says that the nature of this job has changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.806" offset="14463073">And that is an essential part of understanding this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.924" offset="14475611">And there is an entire amicus brief in addition to our submission on behalf of pharmaceutical representatives, which explains how very much the requirements of pharmaceutical detailers and the restrictions on them have changed dramatically over the last couple of decades in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.250" offset="14528901">And that's why the continued references to years are wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.035" offset="14544052">The other important part about the FLSA in particular is that there is a statute on this issue, and it says that an employer can request guidance from the agency; and if it doesn't do that, it is not -- it has no defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.926" offset="14595566">Its job is to ask for guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.795" offset="14603089">And there are 50 different exemptions from the FLSA that cover hundreds of different categories of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.263" offset="14624927">And if the rule you are going to announce -- because Mr. Clement's view is you shouldn't be bound by any precedent, if the rule you are going to now announce is that there has to be rulemaking with respect to all of those, it's going to be an administrative nightmare.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.387" offset="14669440">Two quick further points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.756" offset="14674873">The Department of Labor's position is that there has to be an actual commitment, not a precatory commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.374" offset="14693368">And Mr. Clement says, well, that's contrary to the definition of 3(k).</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.945" offset="14711654">Please read the definition again, and if you find something in there, something that is not a commitment -- it can be an exchange; it can be a commitment that is even a consignment; it can be a traditional sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.901" offset="14751464">Every one of those things is commitment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.920" offset="14759615">It is impossible to find in the definition of commitment a rule that says -- excuse me, in the definition of sale--</text>
