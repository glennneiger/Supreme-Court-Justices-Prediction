            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Justice Thomas has our opinion this morning in Case 10-577, Kawashima versus Holder.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="6.773" offset="132535">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.948" offset="157194">Mr. and Mrs. Kawashima, who are citizens of Japan and who are at lawful permanent residence in this country, were both convicted of federal tax crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.348" offset="206827">Mr. Kawashima was convicted of knowingly and willfully submitting a materially false tax return and Mrs. Kawashima was convicted of willfully aiding or assisting in the preparation of the materially false tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.610" offset="279865">An Immigration Judge ordered the Kawashimas removed from the United States on the ground that their convictions qualified as aggravated felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.355" offset="322811">Specifically, the Immigration Judge determined that the convictions involved fraud or deceit that caused a loss to the Government of at least $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.313" offset="370667">The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the Immigration Judge's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.230" offset="390311">The Ninth Circuit agreed that the Kawashima's conviction involved fraud or deceit, but it remanded for the Board to determine whether Mrs. Kawashima's conviction had, in fact, caused a loss to the Government in excess of $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.226" offset="458334">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.002" offset="473381">The Immigration and Nationality Act grants the Attorney General the authority to remove any alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at anytime after admission to this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.896" offset="524999">The Act defines an aggravated felony as among other things, an offense that involves fraud or deceit.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.971" offset="557286">To determine whether an offense involves fraud or deceit, we look to the statute defining the crime of conviction rather than to the specific facts underlying the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.676" offset="608172">Mr. Kawashima was convicted of violating a statute that states that anyone who "willfully makes and subscribes any return which contains or is verified by a written declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury, and which he does not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter," shall be guilty of a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.024" offset="709528">Although, neither "fraud" nor "deceit" is a formal element of that crime, Mr. Kawashima's conviction necessarily involved deceit because it entailed knowingly and willfully submitting a tax return that was materially false.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.950" offset="777237">Similarly, Mrs. Kawashima was convicted of violating a statute that declares that any person who "willfully aids or assists in the preparation or presentation of a return which is fraudulent or as false as to any material matter" has committed a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.088" offset="865740">Mrs. Kawashima's conviction also necessarily involved deceit because it entailed knowingly and willfully assisting the filing of a materially false return.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.588" offset="911820">By its plain language, the Immigration and Nationality Act incorporates a broad class of offenses that involved fraud or deceit within the definition of an aggravated felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.502" offset="963438">We reject that Kawashima's argument that Congress limited the scope of that broad language by stating in a second provision that tax evasion is also an aggravated felony when the tax loss to the Government exceeds $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.121" offset="1033864">The Kawashimas assert that by expressly making tax evasion an aggravated felony, Congress implicitly removed all other tax offenses, including the Kawashimas' offenses, from the category of crimes involving fraud and deceit.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.005" offset="1101469">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.475" offset="1107320">We think it more likely that Congress sought to remove any doubt that's the serous offense of tax evasion was an aggravated felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.036" offset="1145563">Moreover, nothing in the provision for tax evasion alters the otherwise plain meaning of crimes involving fraud or deceit.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.682" offset="1188195">Because the Kawashimas are subject to deportation as aliens who have been convicted of aggravated felonies, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.057" offset="1229678">Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Breyer and Kagan join.</text>
