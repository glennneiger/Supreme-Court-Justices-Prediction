            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Kennedy has our opinion this morning in Case 10-218, PPL Montana, LLC versus Montana.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="9.249" offset="143485">As a general rule, when a State enters the Union, it takes title to riverbeds where the river above the bed is navigable.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.899" offset="186013">This rule follows from the constitutional principle known as the equal-footing doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.819" offset="205761">And the purpose of that -- that doctrine is to allow newly admitted States the same ownership and control of riverbeds that the original 13 States enjoyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.725" offset="253304">The general principles of the original 13 States and newly admitted States are on an equal-footing.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.216" offset="279322">Navigability is determined as of the date the State entered the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.357" offset="295832">Typically, the United States owned the beds of navigable rivers before statehood and it's ownership of beds within the State's borders passed to the States when it entered the Union and there are qualifications to that general principle, but those need not be of a concern for this brief summary.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.081" offset="366780">Montana became a State in 1889.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.279" offset="379528">This case presents the question whether parts or segments of three different rivers were of navigable, as the law defines that concept, on that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.803" offset="417667">The three rivers or to be more precise, the -- the rivers whose segments are in question here are the Missouri River, the Madison River and the Clark Fork.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.464" offset="456328">On portions of each of these rivers, all -- and they're all in Montana, a power company, which is the petitioner here, owns and operates dams or related hydroelectric facilities and the company is PPL Montana, the petitioner in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.750" offset="521425">For a number of years, PPL paid rent to the United States on the understanding that it was paying for use of lands that included the riverbeds that the United States owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.525" offset="560504">Then in 2003, parents of Montana school children filed a suit arguing that the beds belong to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.802" offset="589657">This suit was later filed and the suit -- and the State argued that rent should be paid to it because it, the State of Montana, owns the beds under the equal-footing doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.434" offset="628214">The Montana Supreme Court held the rivers were navigable at the time of statehood and so they awarded judgment to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.490" offset="656426">This Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.312" offset="663740">For the reasons explained in today's opinion, the judgment of the Montana court is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.422" offset="684116">The principle error of the Montana court was in its failure to adhere to this Court's precedents on whether and when certain segments of the river must be deemed nonnavigable.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.391" offset="731972">This Court's well-settled rule that navigability can be assessed on a segment by segment basis, a rule given too little weight by the Montana court, is based on practical considerations and these include the fact that physical conditions may very significantly along the whole length of a river.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.465" offset="804279">This Court's segment by segment approach applies to the river segments here.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.173" offset="819116">The case involves riverbed parcels and segments of the rivers where it is doubtful, the State can establish navigability, even if there might exist some riverbed parcels too small for the river segments above them to merit separate treatment, the parcels here, in particular, the portions of the riverbed under the Great Falls reach of the Missouri River are not so small as to be worthless or in administrable and there are other points as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.316" offset="919740">Explorers at some places, particularly at the Great Falls reach, could not continue travel by river without inland portage.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.990" offset="954431">Portage generally demonstrates the river waters cannot be navigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.953" offset="970209">The state court did not give the necessary consideration to this factor in considering navigability.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.476" offset="992360">The state court was mistaken too in the weight it placed on evidence of present-day primarily recreational use of the Madison River.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.415" offset="1028096">As the opinion explains, the reliance was not supported by the necessary findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.036" offset="1050561">Finally, Montana files its claim for riverbed rents over a century after the first PPL's dams was built upon the riverbeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.029" offset="1086610">Today's opinion notes that the State's long failure to assert title is some additional evidence that the river segments here involved were deemed nonnavigable for purposes of the equal-footing doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.906" offset="1134049">The judgment of the Montana Supreme Court is reversed and the case is remanded, the opinion is unanimous.</text>
