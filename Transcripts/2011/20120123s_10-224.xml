            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">This morning, Justice Kagan has the opinion of the Court in Case 10-224, National Meat Association versus Harris.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="7.854" offset="136819">The issue in this case is whether a federal statute called the Federal Meat Inspection Act or FMIA preempts a California law to tell slaughterhouses how to deal with so-called nonambulatory animals, meaning animals that cannot walk.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.809" offset="208708">This suit is brought by swine slaughterhouses, so it involves the application of the state law to nonambulatory pigs.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.318" offset="242667">The FMIA, the federal law in this case, is designed to ensure both the safety of meat and the humane handling of animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.974" offset="277358">It provides for federal officials to inspect each animal brought to a slaughterhouse to decide whether that animal can be made into food for human consumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.450" offset="319258">It also sets out rules for house slaughterhouses are to -- are to humanely handle animals at each step of the slaughtering process.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.320" offset="358651">The FMIA, like many federal statutes, has what's known as a Preemption Clause which prevents the application of certain state laws regulating similar subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.338" offset="406821">The FMIA's Preemption Clause sweeps broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.187" offset="422181">It essentially prevents a State from imposing any additional or different requirements concerning a slaughterhouse's operations, facilities or premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.683" offset="468156">The California law at issue here, Section 599f of the State's penal code requires swine slaughterhouses immediately to euthanize any nonambulatory pig on its premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.930" offset="525103">It also prohibits slaughterhouses from buying or receiving such pigs and from processing, butchering or selling their meat.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.256" offset="562406">We hold today that the FMIA's Preemption Clause forecloses operation of the state law and we therefore reverse the different judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.324" offset="614755">California's law at every turn imposes different requirements on swine slaughterhouses than the FMIA does when it comes to handling nonambulatory pigs.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.453" offset="659268">In essence, California statute substitutes a new regulatory scheme for the one the FMIA has established and that is precisely what is forbidden by the FMIA's Preemption Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.337" offset="714752">Our opinion shows in detail how federal and state law differ in telling slaughterhouses what to do with nonambulatory pigs.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.532" offset="747562">We first look at the situation in which a pig becomes nonambulatory after arrival at the slaughterhouse because of the strains of the slaughtering process itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.203" offset="786223">In that circumstance, the state law instructs slaughterhouses to immediately take the pig out of the production process and euthanize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.627" offset="819973">Correspondingly, the state law prohibits the slaughterhouse from turning that animal into meat, but the federal law permits a slaughterhouse to keep nonambulatory pigs in the production process so long as they do not suffer from certain serious diseases and the federal law also permits slaughterhouses to butcher, process and sell the meat of those animals, subject to a federal inspector's approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.967" offset="921328">So, California's law imposes requirements, the FMIA does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.152" offset="942017">That's also true when a pig is delivered to the slaughterhouse in a nonambulatory condition, usually because of harsh transportation conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.094" offset="977753">The California bar -- California law bars a slaughterhouse from purchasing or receiving such animals, essentially requiring the slaughterhouse to return the animals to their sender.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.342" offset="1022788">The federal law specifically authorizes the slaughterhouse to buy nonambulatory animals and indeed federal law contemplates that a slaughterhouse will accept custody of those animals and send them through the normal inspection process, so here too the state law tells the slaughterhouse one thing, while the federal law tells it another.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.168" offset="1114112">Our opinion considers various arguments California has made in defense of its statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.693" offset="1136159">The most fundamental and the one the Ninth Circuit relied on is that the California law escapes the purview of the FMIA's Preemption Clause because it regulates only the kind of animal that may be slaughtered rather than the inspection or slaughtering process itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.983" offset="1205332">We think that is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.128" offset="1213900">Federal law concerns itself with this very same matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.247" offset="1230409">The FMAI -- the FMIA operates to exclude many kinds of animals from the slaughtering process, including nonambulatory cows.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.516" offset="1271474">It is true enough that federal law does not ban the slaughter of nonambulatory swine, but that is to say only that federal law and state law differ, not that state law gets to govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.304" offset="1326644">The long and short of the matter is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.003" offset="1337407">The FMIA comprehensively regulates the treatment and handling of nonambulatory pigs throughout their time on a slaughterhouse's premises from the moment a delivery truck arrives with them at the gate.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.452" offset="1395190">California's law regulates the same thing at the same time in the same place.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.473" offset="1423297">The federal law, the FMIA therefore preempts it.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.072" offset="1441688">We accordingly reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.619" offset="1455898">Our opinion is unanimous.</text>
