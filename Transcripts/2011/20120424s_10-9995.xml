            <text syncTime="7.397" offset="134019">This case presents a question of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.498" offset="150424">When a State deliberately refrains from challenging a federal habeas petition as filed too late, may a Court of Appeals on its own initiative dismiss the petition as untimely?</text>
            <text syncTime="28.137" offset="216984">The answer we hold is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.238" offset="229313">Colorado prisoner, Patrick Wood, filed a petition for habeas corpus relief in federal court in 2008, 19 years after he was tried and convicted in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.535" offset="286574">In the interim, Wood pursued ultimately unavailing petitions for state court relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.306" offset="317607">Upon receiving Wood's petition, the District Court asked the state's attorney, “Do you plan to argue that the petition was untimely?”</text>
            <text syncTime="64.264" offset="361493">The State twice told the Court, it would not challenge, but was not conceding the timeliness of Wood's petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.067" offset="404647">Thereafter, the District Court rejected Wood's claim on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.324" offset="425650">On appeal, the Tenth Circuit directed parties to brief both the merits and the question whether Wood's petition had been timely filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.080" offset="468699">Post-briefing, the Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of Wood's petition, but solely on the ground that the petition was untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.883" offset="511958">We reverse the Tenth Circuit's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.357" offset="525855">As our recent decisions explain, federal courts have discretion to consider on their own motion, a statute of limitations defense, the State failed to raise in answering a habeas petition, but that authority should be reserved for exceptional cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.208" offset="605268">It should not be exercised when a State is aware of a timeliness defense and intelligently chooses not to rely on it in the court of first instance, that is what occurred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.164" offset="661065">The State was well aware of the statute of limitations defense and of the arguments it could make in support of that defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.317" offset="697637">Nevertheless, the State informed the District Court both preliminarily and in its formal answer that it would not challenge the timeliness of Wood's petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.635" offset="742985">The State does deliberately relinquish the limitations defense and invited a decision on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.747" offset="775377">Because the State waived the objection that Wood sued too late, the Tenth Circuit should have followed the District Court's lead and decided the merits of Wood's claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.679" offset="831070">Justice Thomas has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justice Scalia joins.</text>
