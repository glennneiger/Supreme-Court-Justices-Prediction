            <text syncTime="7.454" offset="137300">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.522" offset="145554">In Hernandez-Casillas, the Attorney General confirmed that a lawful permanent resident subject to deportation, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="16.543" offset="173662">"must have the same opportunity to seek discretionary relief as an alien who has temporarily left this country and upon reentry been subject to exclusion. "</text>
            <text syncTime="25.048" offset="207621">2 months later in its published decision in Matter of Meza, the BIA again confirmed that an immigrant deportable for an aggravated felony could seek relief because his conviction could also form the basis for excludability.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.189" offset="256209">Immigrants in situations indistinguishable from Mr. Judulang's applied for and received relief under this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.279" offset="284630">The BIA's decision in Blake changed the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.914" offset="299154">Without explaining or even initially acknowledging that it was doing so, the Blake rule was impermissibly retroactive, and it is arbitrary and capricious on its own merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.187" offset="336248">We would submit the evidence--</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="58.803" offset="342727">How do you explain -- I mean, I think that is a principal point, whether Blake and Brieva changed the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.958" offset="375327">How do you explain the language in Matter of Wadud, which antedates by a good deal those two cases, 1984, which says:</text>
            <text syncTime="78.683" offset="422243">"Section 212(c) can only be invoked in a deportation hearing where the ground of deportation charged is also a ground of inadmissibility. "</text>
            <text syncTime="88.558" offset="461740">It seems to me that that's the basic point.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark C. Fleming</label>
            <text syncTime="91.141" offset="471980">--Two responses to that, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.257" offset="480444">I agree, Matter of Wadud is the principal response that the government has, and it does not help them at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.061" offset="499670">Wadud was deportable for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. 1546, and the BIA had held in a case called Matter of RG in 1958 that that conviction did not render him excludable.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.469" offset="553378">And that is confirmed later in the case of Matter of Jimenez-Santillano, which also involved a 1546 conviction, where the BIA says that if Mr. Jimenez had left of the country and returned it appears that he would not have been inadmissible and compares that situation to someone convicted of a firearms offense, which the board and the Attorney General had always said were not waivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.882" offset="634984">To the extent there is any ambiguity in the language that Your Honor read, it could not have survived the Attorney General's decision in Hernandez-Casillas, which I just quoted at the beginning of the presentation, which said that what one looks to is whether alien in exclusion proceedings would be able to invoke section 212(c) relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.778" offset="706560">And when the board then addressed the case of the aggravated felony in Matter of Meza, it did not even address Wadud or view it as binding at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.016" offset="735504">It looked to the conviction and whether it formed a basis for excludability.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.235" offset="752431">And the BIA then followed up with no fewer than eight decisions in crime of violence cases indistinguishable from this case where the BIA cited, not Wadud, not any of the other cases that the government is relying on, but cited Meza as articulating the doctrine that the focus of analysis is on the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.699" offset="826305">And the Court has the briefs of several former immigration officials, including two INS general counsel and several INS trial attorneys, confirming that that was the position and the basis on which the government litigated these cases--</text>

            <text syncTime="195.391" offset="888999">If I may, I was just going to say that a number of these cases, crime of violence cases, reached the merits in both the BIA and the courts of appeals without the government even suggesting that there was a statutory counterpart problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.382" offset="941035">In fact, when it has suited its purposes the government and the BIA have admitted that Blake was a change, including in a brief filed in the Ninth Circuit less than a year ago.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="216.305" offset="972696">You cite some cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.007" offset="983458">You say there was a dramatic change in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.857" offset="990877">The government cites some cases and it says there was no change in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.828" offset="1006759">What if the truth lies someplace in the middle.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.046" offset="1019611">What if, in fact, when you look before Blake what you see is some amount of confusion; that the board sometimes was following the Blake rule, but that at other times individual judges or maybe the board itself were doing something different, because the individual circumstances suggested that they should, or just because they weren't so clear on the difference between these two approaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.180" offset="1128176">And then Blake comes along, and what Blake does is neither to change something dramatically nor to just reaffirm what was there, but in some sense to create a little bit of order out of chaos.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.021" offset="1179585">What would that do to your argument if that's the way one understood Blake?</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark C. Fleming</label>
            <text syncTime="271.973" offset="1195363">Obviously, Justice Kagan, we don't think that is the proper way to understand Blake.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.026" offset="1211559">But to answer the question, for purposes of the retroactivity analysis, the Court uses what the Court in St. Cyr called</text>
            <text syncTime="282.097" offset="1235905">"considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations. "</text>
            <text syncTime="286.066" offset="1251683">And we would submit that reliance was more than reasonable and expectations more than settled as to how the board was addressing crime of violence aggravated felony convictions prior to Blake, as is shown by the evidence that I cited a minute ago, namely the position that the government itself was taking in these cases and the way that immigrants would have been advised by both criminal defense counsel and immigration counsel, including, for that matter, INS trial counsel.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="311.534" offset="1353561">Well, reliance on confused law is certainly not reasonable reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.986" offset="1367458">I mean, if you accept the -- the premise that Justice Kagan operates from, how can you say that -- that you're reasonably relying on confused law?</text>

            <text syncTime="326.626" offset="1413956">I don't accept the premise at all, Justice Scalia, that the law was confused.</text>

          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="330.678" stopTime="331.447">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="330.678" offset="1430152">Well, that's a different point.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark C. Fleming</label>
            <text syncTime="331.447" offset="1433287">But even if -- even if there was some lack of clarity in the law, and we don't think there was, I think the record in this -- before the Court is very clear, that people were advised by competent counsel and that the government itself took the same position in front of the immigration courts and the courts of appeals that someone with a crime of violence aggravated felony conviction could seek relief because that conviction would make him or her excludable and the availability of relief in deportation proceedings is meant to be the same as it would be in exclusion proceedings.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="361.549" offset="1553659">I understand the advice of counsel, but what is the reasonable expectation of that's been altered?</text>

          <turn speaker="mark_c_fleming" startTime="366.520" stopTime="382.113">
            <label>Mr. Mark C. Fleming</label>
            <text syncTime="366.520" offset="1573512">The reasonable expectation that once someone pleads guilty, Mr. Chief Justice, to an excludable offense, one that would be waivable in exclusion proceedings, that a waiver may be sought in subsequent deportation proceedings on exactly the same basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.761" offset="1626488">And that is the published policy of the BIA.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="382.113" stopTime="393.938">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="382.113" offset="1635892">So you're saying that the expectation is when he pleads guilty to a violent felony, that he expects, well, if I am deported because of that I am going to be able to seek discretionary waiver?</text>

          <turn speaker="mark_c_fleming" startTime="393.938" stopTime="413.349">
            <label>Mr. Mark C. Fleming</label>
            <text syncTime="393.938" offset="1683226">Yes, that's quite correct, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.540" offset="1693675">That is the ruling in St. Cyr, that when someone -- when someone pleads guilty to an offense that is eligible for relief under 212(c) there is reliability on the possibility -- not a guarantee of a waiver, obviously, but the avoidance of mandatory deportation, appealing to the discretion of the Attorney General.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark C. Fleming</label>
            <text syncTime="414.601" offset="1765878">Quite frequently, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.534" offset="1773610">The Court pointed out in St. Cyr that they are frequent and now, because the category of people who are eligible involves people who have very old convictions, they necessarily pled before 1996, they are usually minor offenses, they involve people who have been in this country for a long time, they frequently have property, they have families, they can show rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.615" offset="1849887">Often they only come to the attention of the immigration authorities by applying for naturalization or by renewing their green cards, and they get thrown into deportation on the basis of these old convictions that at the time of the plea would have been eligible for at waiver, and it is simply unfair to change the law, as Blake did, and impose that change on people who relied on it in pleading guilty.</text>

            <text syncTime="456.611" offset="1933897">But in terms of the expectation interest, we have to visualize someone who is facing a serious charge and is entering a plea bargain, where presumably the consideration of what he's pleading to, how much of a sentence he's going to get, all that, are dominant considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.990" offset="2003383">And he's also going to say: Well, I have been advised that I will be able to apply for a discretionary waiver, so I'm going to plead guilty.</text>

            <text syncTime="487.380" offset="2056986">The Court in St. Cyr made very clear that's a very likely situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.032" offset="2071615">It cited a couple of cases at that time that specifically involved that colloquy.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.236" offset="2088438">The NIJC amicus brief which is before the Court in this case identifies a couple of situations, including the case of Mr. Ronald Bennett, who was advised by his lawyer that when he pled guilty it would not be a problem for him for his immigration status because he could seek 212(c) protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="512.146" offset="2156042">I'm not questioning the fact that he was advised, but presumably the lawyer will also advise him: Oh, and you also have to pay the $250, you know, restitution, whatever, fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.553" offset="2193659">I am just questioning how significant that advice will be when someone's determining whether to plead guilty or not to a violent felony.</text>

            <text syncTime="982.401" offset="4037068">Unless the Court has further questions on retroactivity, I would move quickly to our substantive position, which is that even without regard to retroactivity, the Blake rule is arbitrary and capricious, and there are two basic reasons for that: First, that it rests on improper factors; and second, that it leads to results that the BIA itself has disavowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.212" offset="4108330">First of all, Congress has never suggested that the words that it chooses in deportation provisions are somehow a key to eligibility for section 212(c) relief, and yet that is largely everything that the board relied on in Blake, was a comparison of the choice of words in deportation provisions to the choice of words in exclusion provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.774" offset="4186593">But the -- the provisions of the deportation statute are not some enigmatic code from which the BIA can discern section 212(c) eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.799" offset="4226612">They determine who is deportable, but they have nothing to say about who is eligible for section 212 c.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.120" offset="4247928">Section 212 c eligibility turns on whether you are inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.921" offset="4263184">That is what 212 c by its terms refers to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.789" offset="4274573">And that's driven home, I believe, by the addition of the crime of violence language in 1990 as a basis for deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.727" offset="4306338">Aggravated felonies were added in 1990 at a time when it -- I believe it's clear that most of them, if not all of them, were already bases for exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.751" offset="4346462">So there was no need for Congress to say crimes of violence are excludable, they already were because they were crimes involving moral turpitude.</text>

            <text syncTime="1130.847" offset="4630883">But just because Congress uses different words in the deportation subsection that is asserted against a particular alien doesn't mean that the analysis stops, there, because the conviction might well make the person excludable such that the application that they are able to file in deportation proceedings should give them the same relief that they would have in an exclusion proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.223" offset="4700369">So what happened in 1990 when 212 c eligibility stealthily and silently, because of course while Congress was amending 212 c at that time, saying it was no longer available to deportable aliens who didn't show up for certain hearings and no longer available for aggravated felons who were deportable who had served more than five years in prison, it had said nothing suggesting that people who had committed aggravated felony crimes of violence were all of a sudden ineligible for section 212 c relief, even though it could have said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.830" offset="4842789">The notion that one can infer or decode those provisions as shutting out section 212 c relief for this group of people silently, even though the overlap is perfect if not near perfect is we would submit simply unreasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1236.798" offset="5054694">"long established view of the Attorney General in the federal courts that an application for Section 212(c) relief filed in the context of deportation proceedings is equivalent to one made at the time an alien physically seeks admission into the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.540" offset="5109656">That is footnote 22 of matter of AA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.309" offset="5116656">So the agency's longstanding position, at least since Silva, has been that there is no difference between an application filed in deportation and one filed in exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.165" offset="5156153">And that I think is consistent with what Attorney General Thornburg said in the matter of Hernandez-Casillas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.802" offset="5174648">I'd submit one last point, which is the arbitrariness of what the BIA is doing shines through in that it has led to consequences that the BIA has itself repudiated as inconsistent with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.877" offset="5223027">And the most salient example is the one that the government admits on page 26 of its brief, which is that there is a possibility that someone could get a waiver of inadmissibility one day for a given conviction and then be deported the next day for the very same conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.203" offset="5280287">Now the BIA in 1956 in matter of G.A. said that was clearly repugnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.190" offset="5304216">That the agency cannot have it both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.557" offset="5313724">The statute cannot mean X and not X.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.909" offset="5323128">If it does, that is the Hallmark of arbitrariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.194" offset="5332219">The government's only answer, as far as I know, is that it will exercise its prosecutorial discretion to avoid that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.115" offset="5359909">I would submit that an agency cannot defend an arbitrary policy by saying that it is going to be enforced in a capricious way and that it will all balance out in the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.972" offset="5399406">This Court should evaluate the Blake rule on its own merits and if it is arbitrary, as it clearly is, it should be disapproved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.292" offset="5424588">The other indication of arbitrariness is that the Blake rule revives the distinction between deportable aliens, Justice Kennedy, who traveled abroad and returned and other deportable aliens who did not travel aboard and returned.</text>

            <text syncTime="1362.295" offset="5556663">But five years after Wadud, in Hernandez-Casillas, Attorney General Thornburg was asked by the INS to disapprove Matter of L -- Justice Jackson's decision as Attorney General, and Matter of G-A and the nunc pro tunc doctrine that is set out in those decisions, and he expressly declined to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.006" offset="5623536">On the contrary, he reaffirmed that in cases where the alien has left and come back, the Attorney General and the board have permitted the alien to raise any claim for discretionary relief that the alien could otherwise have raised had he been excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.131" offset="5672020">So nunc pro tunc clearly is still good law, and the government seemed to agree with that as recently as its brief in opposition to certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.468" offset="5697306">As for the travel distinction itself the government to its credit does not try to defend it, and for good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.122" offset="5719980">The agency in Silva has long held that there is no distinction or no rational way to distinguish under the statute between people who are in deportation proceedings who have left and come back and people in deportations who have not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1431.239" offset="5832411">The Petitioner does not dispute that some comparability analysis must be applied to prevent relief under former section 212 c from being extended to certain grounds of de portability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.564" offset="5869714">But his methodology of asking whether his offense could have made him excludable is inconsistent with established cases from the board that long predated the ones at issue here involving firearms offenses and visa fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.554" offset="5921646">Justice Scalia brought up the case in Wadud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.839" offset="5930841">That was a visa fraud case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.673" offset="5938155">It was a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 1546.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.393" offset="5952993">That's a provision that penalizes fraudulent and other misuse of visas and other immigration documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.147" offset="5980056">It's a very broad criminal provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1471.949" offset="5995311">And at the time the alien argued that this is fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.251" offset="6012447">It's a crime involving moral turpitude and therefore I would be subject to exclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1482.907" offset="6039092">That's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.240" offset="6040451">But it may save a little time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.123" offset="6047974">I worry we're in an arcane area of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.576" offset="6065737">It was created by Robert Jackson, Attorney General and by Thorn burg, Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.564" offset="6089770">And if we are starting with that, what that says is we have a list over here of excludable things and we have a list of deportable things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.901" offset="6119027">And if you are deported for a reason that shows up on that first list, than the AG could waive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.888" offset="6143060">That's basically the outline I have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.490" offset="6149433">And also I have, which isn't quite right, that in that first list there is something called -- in big letters, CIMT or something, crime of moral turpitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.430" offset="6185169">And all of the things on the second list, the big issue is, is it a crime of moral turpitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.234" offset="6204395">As I looked through the opinions, this is what I got out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.269" offset="6216516">This is tentative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.202" offset="6224248">I got out, just as you say, there are two things in the second list which are not crimes of moral turpitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.705" offset="6250266">They consist of illegal entry crimes and gun crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.409" offset="6265104">And there are special reasons for the first and the second is debatable, but they have been consistent with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.311" offset="6284748">Then there are things that are on both lists, they are crimes of moral turpitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.265" offset="6300526">I counted at least eight cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.399" offset="6309094">Say, for example, rape, burglary, manslaughter, second degree robbery, indecency with a child and probably some others are all crimes of moral turpitude, so it cuts here, okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.059" offset="6363742">Then I find Blake, and Blake says sexual abuse of a minor is not a crime of moral turpitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.630" offset="6393940">That's a little surprising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.530" offset="6397597">But it gives us a reason because, and this was the problem here, it talks about, there has to be substantial -- there has to be similar language in the two lists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.355" offset="6444931">I don't know where that one came from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.922" offset="6451200">It certainly had not been in the earlier cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.240" offset="6460395">And now we have this case, which is voluntary manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.478" offset="6477427">I would have thought that voluntary manslaughter is right at the heart of the lists that they said the things are crimes of moral turpitude, and not like visa crimes or gun crimes, if I read the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.350" offset="6520895">So where do I end up?</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.686" offset="6526224">Well, what I end up with is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.186" offset="6532180">And this is what I would like you to reply to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.988" offset="6539389">Justice Brandies once said something like we have to know before we can say whether an agency opinion is right or wrong, what they are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.426" offset="6573140">I felt perplexity after I had read through these decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.397" offset="6597068">In other words, I don't understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.980" offset="6603337">So I would like you to explain to me why this all fits together and how, if you can do that, I couldn't get that clear explanation from the brief, and I suspect it is not your fault.</text>

            <text syncTime="1652.099" offset="6715873">Justice Breyer, you talked about the fact that the board had been consistent in firearms offenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="2283.306" offset="9240660">One is that there is no factual basis in the administrative record to -- to talk about this 1987 trip to the Philippines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.976" offset="9267409">Yes, we do have evidence from outside the record that makes us believe that it occurred, but the statute that provides for judicial review here of the order of removability in 8 U.S.C. 1252(b)(4)(A) specifically says that the determination needs to be made on a basis of the administrative record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.287" offset="9340656">And the only evidence in the record about that trip is actually a statement from Petitioner's mother that says that it occurred in 1989, the year after the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.877" offset="9370958">But even assuming that -- that the trip happened, in light -- as I said, we do believe on the basis of evidence outside the record that it did occur -- there is a legal reason why I would caution the Court against assuming that that means the Petitioner could have been deportable for a crime involving moral turpitude, and that is the so-called Fleuti Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.487" offset="9433443">Under this Court's 1963 decision in Rosenberg v. Fleuti, which is actually relevant to a case on which you granted certiorari a couple of weeks ago, this Court concluded that if an LPR takes a brief, casual, and innocent trip outside the country and returns to the United States, that will not trigger an entry upon his return to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.116" offset="9511915">And so I think it's very likely that under Ninth Circuit precedent in 1989, when Petitioner was pleading guilty to his voluntary manslaughter charge, he wouldn't have had any reason to think that he was doing so within 5 years of when he committed -- when he entered the country for purposes of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3259.138" offset="13143980">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.007" offset="13155474">I would begin simply by following up on the questions that Justices Ginsburg and Kagan asked to my brother about my client could have been charged as deportable with his conviction treated as a crime involving moral turpitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.165" offset="13204167">In fact, he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.583" offset="13209809">If one looks at the decisions in the appendix to the petition for certiorari, specifically at page 11A, it's clear that his conviction is asserted not only as an aggravated felony crime of violence, but also as a crime involving moral turpitude, and the immigration judge found that he was in fact deportable with that conviction forming a crime involving moral turpitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.413" offset="13293087">So there is no dispute here that Mr. Judulang's conviction falls into both categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.148" offset="13312104">On the issue of the factual basis of my client's deportability at the time of the plea, Mr. Gannon is correct; there is nothing in the administrative record that says that, and that is why this Court typically does not countenance arguments based on the facts by the respondents that are raised only in the brief on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.994" offset="13375425">If anyone had suggested that this was an issue on which a factual record needed to be developed, we could have done it; it would not have been hard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.148" offset="13400085">I also want to comment on one point that Mr. Gannon made, which is the thing that -- that is waived under 212(c) is a ground of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.619" offset="13441985">That's not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.969" offset="13447314">Section 212(c) provides relief from inadmissibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.037" offset="13463615">It says that clearly in its text; that is how the regulations and the decisions have always treated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.241" offset="13484408">The form that immigrants are instructed to fill out, form I-90 -- I-191 which is appended to our blue brief specifically says: State the reasons you may be inadmissible to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.548" offset="13529652">If a waiver of inadmissibility is granted, that waiver protects the immigrant from subsequent deportation based on the same conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.421" offset="13565179">That is the language of Matter of G-A, which the government itself excerpts in its brief; and Justice Ginsburg is correct, that is -- they admit that a waiver is durable in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.446" offset="13609273">If it is granted to waive inadmissibility, it protects the alien from deportation on any deportation subsection based on that same conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.885" offset="13643024">I thought it was telling, Justice Breyer, in reaction to your question which -- which was seeking an explanation of how this scheme is reasonable, the answer that counsel for the government gave was that the BIA has been consistent with firearms and visa fraud cases, but there was no explanation as to how the Blake rule as it is now drawn is in any way a reasonable application of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.367" offset="13744901">I would submit for the reasons that Your Honor pointed out, which is that we have a number of -- whether one calls them convictions or whether one calls them categories of crimes -- voluntary manslaughter, aggravated burglary -- recall that we are talking about aggravated felony crimes of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.979" offset="13811357">I recognize that if we talk about third degree burglary, which could be charged on the basis of someone opening an unlocked door and walking across the threshold, maybe that's not a crime involving moral turpitude but it is probably is not an aggravated felony crime of violence either, certainly not in this Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.256" offset="13880529">So I would submit that the government has not identified a crime that would be both an aggravated felony crime of violence and yet not a crime involving moral turpitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.479" offset="13925355">The overlap is, I would submit, total.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.464" offset="13937371">And even if it's not total, that is not the end of our argument because the board itself has said you, don't need a perfect match; you just need substantial overlap.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.287" offset="13972584">And the overlap is at the very least substantial, if not complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.572" offset="13985750">The crime that was charged in Brieva-Perez itself, unauthorized use of a vehicle under Texas law, has subsequently held by the Fifth Circuit not to be an aggravated felony at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.229" offset="14036428">So Brieva-Perez on its own terms is no longer good law as we point out in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.533" offset="14057639">The interest that Mr. Gannon asserted at one point about getting immigrants to put themselves into exclusion proceedings, this is a very important point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.256" offset="14096509">The agency has never suggested that that is the way that it runs the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.243" offset="14120438">On the contrary, it has expressly said the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.178" offset="14132140">It does not matter whether the 212(c) application is filed in exclusion proceedings, in deportation proceedings, or outside of proceedings entirely by sending a letter to the district director saying: Please give me an advance waiver before I travel abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.687" offset="14190237">The regulations make very clear and the decisions make very clear, I quoted matter of AA in my opening argument, that an application is identical and a relief that is given is identical, regardless of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.262" offset="14240496">For Mr. Gannon to stand up and say that the agency is now creating a sharp distinction, saying that applications filed in exclusion are omnipotent, and applications filed in deportation proceedings are meaningless is a clear change in the law, and it is unfair to apply it against immigrants like Mr. Judulang and others who relied on the availability of section 212(c) as protection from removal, whether exclusion or deportation in the future, when they pled guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.848" offset="14354808">Justice Sotomayor, your question about how many people are involved here, it is difficult to identify specific numbers because very often these cases are decided at the immigration judge level that are not reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.239" offset="14400470">In the appendix to our petition for certiorari we identified over 160 people who have been subject -- who have suffered under the Blake rule since Blake was decided in 2005.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.714" offset="14446341">And part of the problem is that we are talking about a group of people who have been in the country for a long time, whose convictions are dated, who are law abiding, who are reformed, and they only come to the attention of the authorities subsequently through perfectly law abiding conduct such as applying for naturalization or renewing a green card so that they--</text>

            <text syncTime="3613.131" offset="14560026">And there might be other forms of relief, as Mr. Gannon mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.749" offset="14574446">But -- That's certainly right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.435" offset="14581238">But a good number of the people here who have been harmed by the Blake rule are people who are the most deserving candidates for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.857" offset="14610913">And the NIJC brief, I think, sets that out I think quite convincingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.159" offset="14624078">We would submit that the only reasonable approach here is the one that the agency took for years under Meza and under the eight decisions that Justice Breyer referenced where the immigration knew the rule, they applied it, they looked to the conviction, they figured out whether the conviction would trigger excludability; if it did, then the alien was entitled to apply on the same basis and with the same effect as if he had found himself in exclusion proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.858" offset="14718851">The judgment should be reversed, and Mr. Judulang should be allowed to file his application for adjudication on the merits.</text>
