            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="7.044" offset="136652">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.879" offset="160057">It presents the question whether two Secret Service agents are immune from suit for allegedly arresting a suspect in retaliation for his speech when the agents had probable cause to arrest the suspect for committing a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.929" offset="220244">Secret Service agents, Gus Reichle and Dan Doyle were part of Vice President Cheney's protective detail when he visited a Colorado shopping mall in 2006.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.514" offset="266533">While the Vice President greeted members of the public, Agent Doyle overheard Steven Howards say into his cellphone that he was going to ask the Vice President, “How many kids he had killed that day?”</text>
            <text syncTime="53.100" offset="320867">Howards then approached the Vice President and told him that his policies in Iraq were disgusting.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.478" offset="346363">As the Vice President turned to leave, Howards touched his shoulder.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.838" offset="363813">Howards later claimed that the touch was merely a friendly pat.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.714" offset="379382">Several -- Secret Service agents described it as a hostile push.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.362" offset="401951">After this encounter, Agent Reichle attempted to question Howards about his behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.950" offset="424312">Howards told Reichle to keep the Vice President out of public places if Reichle did not want people to share their opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.836" offset="455868">Howards also falsely denied having touched the Vice President.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.394" offset="474049">Reichle arrested Howards who was charged with harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.469" offset="490350">That charged was later dropped.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.996" offset="500485">Howards subsequently brought this suit against Reichle and Doyle.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.869" offset="519920">Howards claimed that his arrest violated the Fourth Amendment because the agents lacked probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.476" offset="546356">Howards also claimed that his arrest violated the First Amendment because it was retaliation for his criticism of the Vice President.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.297" offset="581674">The agents moved for summary judgment on the ground that they were entitled to qualified immunity, but the District Court denied the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.112" offset="612916">On appeal, the Tenth Circuit held that the agents enjoyed immunity from Howards' Fourth Amendment claim because they had probable cause to arrest Howards for lying to a federal officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.424" offset="666206">As to Howards' First Amendment claim, however, the Court held that agents were not immune because Tenth Circuit precedent clearly held that a retaliatory arrest may violate the First Amendment, even if the arrest is supported by probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.534" offset="738617">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reversed the Tenth Circuit's judgment denying the agents' immunity from Howards' First Amendment claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.675" offset="775189">Qualified immunity shields government officials from civil damage -- damages liability unless the officials violated a constitutional right that has been clearly established.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.367" offset="822000">This Court has -- this Court has never held that there is a First Amendment right to be free from a retaliatory arrest that is independently supported by probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.863" offset="875917">The Tenth Circuit concluded that its own cases had clearly established such a right, but when Howards was arrested the continued viability of the Tenth Circuit precedent was not clear in light of this Court's decision in Hartman versus Moore.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.332" offset="937775">Hartman held that the existence of probable cause defeats a First Amendment claim of retaliatory prosecution and reasonable officers could have concluded that Howards' -- Hartman's rule applied equally to retaliatory arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.294" offset="1005693">First, many of the conflicting Court of Appeals or Courts of Appeals' decisions that prompted our review in Hartman involved both retaliatory arrest and prosecution claims and made no distinction between the two when considering the relevance of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.819" offset="1083747">Second, several features of retaliatory prosecution claims that are central to Harman's rationale are present in retaliatory arrest cases as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.978" offset="1132440">Finally, various Courts of Appeals have concluded that Hartman's no probable cause requirement extends to retaliatory arrest claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.609" offset="1174967">In light of the foregoing, we cannot conclude that Howards has a -- had a clearly established First Amendment right to be free of a retaliatory arrest that was otherwise supported by probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.513" offset="1230555">Thus, agents Reichle and Doyle are entitled to qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.349" offset="1249886">Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justice Breyer joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.005" offset="1276531">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
