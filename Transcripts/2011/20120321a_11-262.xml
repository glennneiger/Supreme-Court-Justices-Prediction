            <text syncTime="11.639" offset="154859">The issue before the Court today is whether Secret Service agents who are prepared to take a bullet for the Vice President must also be prepared to take a retaliatory arrest lawsuit, even when they have probable cause to make an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.698" offset="203133">Respondent in this case seeks personal money damages against two U.S. Secret Service agents who arrested him, allegedly with a retaliatory motive, after he lied to them about whether he touched Vice President Cheney.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sean R. Gallagher</label>
            <text syncTime="42.777" offset="279411">Sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.277" offset="281396">The Respondent in this case seeks personal money damages against three -- against two U.S. Secret Service agents who arrested him, allegedly with a retaliatory motive, after he lied to them about whether he touched Vice President Cheney.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.587" offset="334686">There are three reasons why these agents should not be held personally liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.539" offset="350464">First, the absence of probable cause should be a required element of a retaliatory arrest claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.525" offset="374392">Thus this Court is called upon to answer the question that it left open in Hartman against Moore.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.429" offset="394036">Second, U.S. Secret Service agents acting in their protective capacity should be entitled to a qualified immunity when they make an arrest with probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.552" offset="434474">Indeed, to view it any other way would be to subject Secret Service agents to the potential of retaliatory arrest claims based upon a mere allegation of retaliatory animus, something this Court has steadfastly refused to do, and for good reason: Because retaliatory animus is easy to allege and hard to disprove.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.497" offset="506258">And third, regardless of whether this Court decides to extend the Hartman rule, the law in 2006, at the time of the arrest was not clearly established, thus entitling the agents to qualified immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="141.339" offset="673651">There was a question of assaulting the Vice President, and I think that the charge that eventually was made in the State court was harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.062" offset="712521">So, there is no indication that these officers had 1001 anywhere in their minds.</text>

            <text syncTime="161.985" offset="756198">First of all, under Devenpeck officers are not required to give all of the reasons behind an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.489" offset="778245">But second, and I think perhaps more importantly in this case, when Agent Reichle contacted Mr. Howards and made the arrest, Mr. Howards had lied to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.114" offset="820772">That was relevant to a Secret Service agent's assessment of the risk of the situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="240.187" offset="1069040">That is, this Court has never held that it overcomes an arrest where there's a claim of retaliatory First Amendment action; is that right?</text>

            <text syncTime="255.814" offset="1131525">And what you are saying is your first reason is that we should say that, and the -- the question I wanted to ask you there is, you make a very strong case where the President and Vice President are involved, the need to protect them, but the rule that you there adopt is a rule that will apply to every police officer, anyone who arrests anyone anywhere in the country, and no matter how clear it is that the motive was retaliation against a point of view, that individual will be protected from a Bivens action.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.024" offset="1288364">So it sounds as if your first claim -- the remedy sweeps well beyond the need that you sketch.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.147" offset="1332877">Justice Breyer, I think it has to do with the -- the determination in the -- in the Tenth Circuit and the fact that the -- the Tenth Circuit's decision to extend Devenpeck to these facts was not the subject of a cross-appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="323.524" offset="1402363">I'm just saying if I agree with you on your first that if there is a probable cause for an arrest, then wouldn't I have to say there is no retaliatory First Amendment claim when a border officer chases into Arizona a person with whom he politically disagrees, and there are 14 bishops who will say he cared about nothing but his political disagreement?</text>
            <text syncTime="351.443" offset="1514062">And there is nothing to the contrary, and he says: Oh, I happened to notice, at trial, that when he left he reached out and snatched a five dollar bill that was in the till and so I had probable cause to arrest him.</text>

            <text syncTime="381.130" offset="1632867">What you have outlined is essentially footnote 10 from the Hartman case.</text>

            <text syncTime="619.117" offset="2584769">It can be read as -- as saying that the elements of the constitutional tort itself require the absence of probable cause, or it can be read as saying the elements of the cause of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="631.892" offset="2635865">And the second question had to do with Secret Service agents, because Secret Service agents, unlike police officers providing law enforcement functions, when Secret Service are acting in a protective capacity, they are protecting our Nation's leaders and they are doing so in a very public way, and they are also doing so in a way that is essentially a free speech zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.605" offset="2718725">Virtually everyone that a Secret Service agent encounters when he is protecting the President or the Vice President can allege that they are engaged in free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.277" offset="2749445">So for Secret Service agents in particular, they -- they can legitimately evaluate what someone is saying in order to determine a particular threat level.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.085" offset="2796674">And because of that, Secret Service agents have a similar sort of complexity of causation to the -- the -- the situation addressed in the Hartman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.809" offset="2839515">Now, in Hartman clearly it was a one -- it was a -- a two-individual causation situation, but -- but with -- with regard to Secret Service agents, the causation is similarly complex, because Secret Service agents can legitimately take into account what someone is saying in order to determine a threat level.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.140" offset="2924883">Regardless of whether the Court decides to extend the Hartman case, it's -- it's absolutely clear that the law in 2006, in June of 2006 when the agents made this arrest, was not clearly established.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.732" offset="2983189">The Hartman case was handed down in early 2006.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.553" offset="3002519">It had only been on the books about 3 months when the arrest was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.088" offset="3016625">For that reason, Secret Service agents should be entitled to a qualified immunity in this case because the law was not clearly established.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.825" offset="3047659">With regard to the -- the -- the formulation of qualified immunity that we are asking for, we believe that it is important for Secret Service agents acting in this protective capacity to have the requisite breathing room in order to make decisions in life-or-death or imminent-threat situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.809" offset="3147551">In fact, the qualified immunity that we are advocating is particularly important at the margins, particularly important in situations where it's not clear what a Secret Service agent can do or should do, where a Secret Service agent has to make a snap decision in order to determine whether someone's a threat and then act appropriately.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.938" offset="3224038">The Court in the Atwater case noted that the object of -- of the Court's cases has been to draw standards sufficiently clear and simple to be applied with the fair prospect of surviving judicial second-guessing months and even years after the -- the arrests are made.</text>

            <text syncTime="806.207" offset="3333125">It is an immunity that is contingent upon having -- contingent upon the Secret Service agent being -- acting in a protective capacity and having probable cause to make the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.563" offset="3374608">But certainly, once the immunity attaches, it would be, it would be full immunity from a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.317" offset="3397595">The Court noted earlier this term in Ridner v. Hub case, that judges should be cautious about second-guessing a police officer's assessment made on the scene of the danger presented by a particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.060" offset="3460498">We think that this case aptly demonstrates the situation in which Secret Service agents made very -- very difficult decisions on the spot, and they should not be second-guessed by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.884" offset="3507832">Finally, with regard to the -- whether qualified immunity is -- was clearly established in June of 2006, the Ninth Circuit, the primary case relied upon by the Tenth Circuit was the Skoog case.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.960" offset="3564152">The Skoog case was the case that the Tenth Circuit relied upon in holding that Hartman should not be extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.816" offset="3595603">It's important, though, when you review the Skoog case to -- to read the entire case, because the Skoog court after concluding that -- that Hartman should not be extended, still proceeded with the qualified immunity analysis to determine whether the law was clearly established at the time of the incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.027" offset="3672403">And what the Skoog case concluded was, it looked at -- it looked at the nature of the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.448" offset="3698108">And, you know, we know from the Anderson v. Creighton case that this Court has said it's important when focusing on constitutional rights not to look at the 30,000-foot level, not to look at the high level, but to look at the contours of the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.993" offset="3764250">And that's what the Skoog case did.</text>

            <text syncTime="1655.473" offset="6730193">And for a couple of reasons, I think it fits decidedly within the retaliatory prosecution side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.275" offset="6745448">One is the one I've given, which is that speech can legitimately be taken into account and so it creates complex causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.079" offset="6768645">But the other one is in some sense the flip side of that, which is that in -- in the public employment context, the standard fact pattern is going to involve a long-term relationship between an employer and an employee, during which time there's been no adverse action, the employee then engages in some sort of expressive activity, in the aftermath of which the employer undertakes some adverse action such as a termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.576" offset="6854640">Now, in that context it makes sense to infer that there may well be an illegitimate speech -- speech-suppressive motivation at work, because you have in some sense a control period in the interactions between the employer and the employee that predated the expressive activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.037" offset="6916498">That's not the case when we're dealing with law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.337" offset="6925693">In the law enforcement context in the main, this is a one-time interaction between an officer and a suspect, the arrestee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.643" offset="6954846">You don't have the prior relationship that acts as a control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.262" offset="6965399">And so you have to ask the question whether, based on that one-time relationship, is there a basis for inferring that a speech-suppressing motivation was at work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.333" offset="6993612">And here, because it can be legitimate for an officer to take into account speech in deciding whether this situation was the kind of one in which a law enforcement response is warranted, it makes sense, unlike in the public employment context, to apply the same objective across-the-board screening in the form of a no-probable-cause requirement that we have in prosecutions.</text>
