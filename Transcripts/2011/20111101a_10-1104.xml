            <text syncTime="8.537" offset="139536">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.456" offset="151239">Over the last 3 decades, the Court has made clear that Bivens remedies are disfavored and will only be authorized in narrow situations where there are no adequate alternative means for redressing a plaintiff's injuries and no other factor counsels hesitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.817" offset="216649">Respondent has satisfied neither criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.369" offset="230860">He has not shown that he lacked a traditional tort remedy for the injuries of which he complains, and Petitioners' status as employees of a private contractor rather than the government at a minimum gives rise to factors counseling hesitation.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="46.545" offset="291568">Can we go back to what you said initially, that is if there's no alternative remedy Bivens fills the gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.003" offset="333469">Suppose we had a case just like Carlson, only the State law allows survivor actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.792" offset="376623">In Carlson, I thought the rule emerging from Carlson is that prison personnel in Federal prisons are subject to Bivens liability, and we don't look in each case to see whether they could have been a State tort.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jonathan S. Franklin</label>
            <text syncTime="92.676" offset="476097">--The the rule -- the Carlson rule still applies, Your Honor, because that involved actual Federal government employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.128" offset="497936">And since Carlson, Congress has preempted all tort claims against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.881" offset="520923">So whether Indiana law now, which has been amended, but whether Indiana law provides a remedy or doesn't is immaterial, because Congress has preempted all tort claims against actual employees of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.772" offset="564496">But these -- this case involves -- the Petitioners are not employees of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.826" offset="584767">They are employees of a private contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.909" offset="593021">And under the Westfall Act, what Congress did was preempt all claims against actual government officials while preserving Bivens remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.682" offset="624159">But it did the opposite for employees of private contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.901" offset="640982">For them there are adequate alternative tort remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.288" offset="654566">And it's virtually undisputed in this case that there was such a remedy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.907" offset="673061">And they are deliberately -- Congress expressly excluded them from the category of employees against whom it preserved Bivens remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.695" offset="708169">So yes, in the Carlson situation, there is still a Bivens claim because Congress has expressly preserved that.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.849" offset="732829">But here we have a different congressional policy that we are, in effect, asking the Court to embrace here.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.986" offset="753413">What Congress did in the Westfall Act is it said what in effect we are asking this Court to recognize and what we believe the Court has recognized in cases like Malesko, and that is, where there are adequate alternative tort -- excuse me, where there are no adequate--</text>

            <text syncTime="175.580" offset="807748">Suppose, Mr. Franklin, that there weren't.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.296" offset="814644">I mean, I think you have a good case about California law here.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.298" offset="826661">But suppose we were in a State where the law was very different from what California's law appears to be, where there was no special duty recognized for jailors, and indeed where the basic negligence tort was unavailable to inmates because there was a finding of -- a holding of the State supreme court that there was no duty on the part of jailors to inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.413" offset="923105">What would happen then?</text>

            <text syncTime="205.265" offset="926448">--In that hypothetical instance -- and we do think it's hypothetical -- we think that would be a different case and the Court could in that circumstance say there were no adequate alternative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.038" offset="965528">But the reason we think it's entirely hypothetical is there has nothing been shown in the briefing of this Court and, as the Ninth Circuit dissenters made clear, that any State doesn't afford the bedrock cause of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.928" offset="1013175">And that cause, as the Court held in Malesko quite expressly, is not only adequate to redress any actions that would violate the Eighth Amendment, but it's actually superior.</text>

            <text syncTime="269.271" offset="1182553">These laws -- and the Mississippi law is an example; there is a New York law -- those apply to State government officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.492" offset="1207421">They are similar to the Westfall Act, but on a state level.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.027" offset="1217557">They immunize State government officials from claims, but those claims would be subject to 1983 actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="491.379" offset="2070925">It could be there are forms in some of these prisons that are given out that have section 1983 written on them, that Bivens is there.</text>

            <text syncTime="589.442" offset="2463180">Well, as the case came to the Court in Carlson, it was undisputed that there was no adequate State law remedy, the lower courts had held.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.630" offset="2495990">So that was sort of the basic premise that the Court then went ahead and decided the case on.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.016" offset="2513439">Since Carlson, we've had cases, notably Malesko and also Wilkie, which have made clear that the adequacy of remedies, including State law remedies, is a factor in the Bivens analysis and is in fact the dispositive factor in Malesko, as in this case as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.394" offset="2578954">We don't think that there is really any serious dispute in this case that there were adequate alternative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.798" offset="2604659">Again, the deliberate indifference standard is much, much more hard -- much harder to meet than a traditional negligence standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.535" offset="2635588">California law is, further, more protective of prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.654" offset="2648022">As we understand the Respondents' position, the Court -- they would urge the Court, notwithstanding the availability of alternative remedies in this case and as far as we can tell in every foreseeable case, to create what they refer to as a categorical cause of action, one that would apply regardless of whether the remedies are adequate or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.150" offset="2730047">And in our view, that would turn the Bivens jurisprudence effectively on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.654" offset="2748019">The Court has said Bivens is a narrow -- I think Justice Ginsburg at least paraphrased our argument as saying it's a gap-filling mechanism, which is what our argument is -- that would apply only in those circumstances when it's necessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1063.526" offset="4359565">First, this Court has never recognized a good faith defense, so I wouldn't call it a recognized defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.680" offset="4380150">It is true that some lower courts have applied a good faith defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.532" offset="4395510">Reading those cases, it is not entirely clear exactly what the content of that good faith defense is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.869" offset="4420901">What is clear is that it is something less than qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.771" offset="4436470">It appears in most of the cases that they are grafting on some sort of subjective element, subjective intent element, on top of what you must establish to get qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.845" offset="4480773">So whatever it is, it is something lesser than qualified immunity, and I think that in and of itself creates an asymmetry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.082" offset="4505746">But I think the larger point is, is that these prisoners have alternative adequate remedies under State law because they are suing a private employee rather than a government employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.090" offset="4549736">The government employee is subject to the Westfall Act and therefore all civil actions other than Bivens are preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.261" offset="4574501">So I think that's the fundamental difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.179" offset="4582128">I think it further counsels hesitation because of the lack of a recognized immunity defense, whether that's qualified immunity or good faith.</text>

            <text syncTime="1125.683" offset="4608146">Could you address the question posed earlier of what were to happen if there was a State law that gave absolute immunity to these private correctional officers and that was the case before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.526" offset="4667496">This particular State, it's undisputed, would not permit any kind of intentional or negligence suit against these officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1151.115" offset="4709919">Your Honor, in that hypothetical -- and of course, there is no suggestion in this case that any State has such a rule -- but if a State were to adopt that such rule, I think that would be a case where there is no adequate alternative remedy, because in your -- in your hypothetical, there is absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.994" offset="4769374">There wouldn't be a way for the prisoner to redress -- seek redress for the gravamen of his injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.378" offset="4790899">And I think in that case, we have a very different situation and a Bivens remedy may well be justified.</text>

            <text syncTime="1198.363" offset="4898837">We are simply arguing for a rule that would limit Bivens when there is no adequate State law remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.702" offset="4924228">That is clearly the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.985" offset="4929348">It's clearly going to be the case in the vast majority of Eighth Amendment prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.686" offset="4944185">What this Court should not do is craft a default rule allowing Bivens remedies against employees of private prison corporations just to account for the hypothetical possibility that there may be a case which may or may not ever arise in which an adequate alternative is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.279" offset="5006566">That turns Bivens jurisprudence on its head.</text>

            <text syncTime="1250.446" offset="5107190">--I think it would be difficult to come up with a precise formulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.381" offset="5118892">I think the formulation that we use in our brief is that as long as it redressed the gravamen of the prisoner's injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.035" offset="5145537">So I think as long as it provides some meaningful relief for the injuries and in turn that would provide some deterrence to the individual employees' actions, I think as long as those two elements are present, I think we would think that there is an adequate alternative remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.379" offset="5206977">Or, alternatively, if you wanted to use the words -- the word that this Court used in Bivens, you could approach it from the flip side and say there would not be an adequate alternative remedy where the State law is either inconsistent with or hostile to the corresponding constitutional interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.155" offset="5270089">We submit in this case there is no question that there are remedies available under California State law and as far as we know the State law of every other State in this country that would allow--</text>

            <text syncTime="1310.468" offset="5347307">Do you have any other example of something like that, where the availability of Federal relief turns on the availability of alternative relief under State law?</text>

            <text syncTime="1320.674" offset="5388163">--Your Honor, it may not be an exact analog, but I think Federal due process cases often will look at someone's claims of deprivation of property, an unlawful deprivation of property in violation of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.632" offset="5431944">The Federal court may often look at whether the available State law procedures to provide redress for that claim before it would impose or find a violation of Federal due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.356" offset="5474889">So I think there are analogs where Federal courts do look at the availability of State law remedies and look at their adequacy before determining whether a Federal law remedy is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.795" offset="5516581">And this Court has done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.331" offset="5522745">And the Court did it in Malesko, I think is the best example in the Bivens context of where the Court looked at alternative State remedies and said that, hey look, the availability of these other remedies counsel against the imposition of the Bivens remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1370.307" offset="5586693">I mean there is an obvious theory when Congress has provided an alternative remedial system, which is a separation of powers theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.760" offset="5612502">But what's the theory about looking to State law for these kinds of alternative remedies?</text>

            <text syncTime="1381.564" offset="5631728">Two responses, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.031" offset="5637580">While I agree the separation of powers problem is much more heightened when Congress acts, I think there is still a separation of powers issue even when Congress has not acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.306" offset="5678644">That is, the Court should be hesitant before -- before implying a judicial cause of action for damages under the Constitution, given that it's typically been Congress's province to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.180" offset="5722112">But beyond that, the rationales -- there have been two rationales that have been given by this Court in its Bivens jurisprudence for implying such a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.285" offset="5758579">One is the need to provide some meaningful relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.821" offset="5772685">We submit when there is an alternative state remedy, that rational has been satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.475" offset="5791284">The other rationale this Court has offered is provide some deterrent to the actions of an individual employee or officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.045" offset="5817616">We also submit that when there is a State tort damages remedy available, that rationale too will be accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.866" offset="5844888">The three occasions in which this Court has recognized the Bivens remedy, Bivens itself, Davis and Carlson, those two factors were not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.055" offset="5877593">There was either no alternative remedy at all or at least, as in Carlson, no alternative remedy against the individual officer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1659.225" offset="6742350">We don't think the law is clear in -- excuse me -- in California that his other claims, the deprivation, nutrition, hygiene, forced labor at some point before his injuries were healed, that those would necessarily be covered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1685.125" offset="6845900">But there is nothing here that could assure this Court that that's the way it will work out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.161" offset="6866066">With regards to why Bivens are superior, Bivens are superior when there is no State cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.231" offset="6890308">So there will be some cases, as we concede, where a State cause of action is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.385" offset="6910997">The reason Mr. Pollard brings a Federal cause of action in this case is because it's not clear that State remedies are certainly available.</text>

            <text syncTime="2635.316" offset="10646716">The Court in Malesko said that Malesko, that case, was in every meaningful sense the same as FDIC v. Meyer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2971.336" offset="11990768">But we don't think this Court should take the enforcement of Federal rights in Federal prisons with regard to Federal actors and set up a scheme where that is handled through state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2986.178" offset="12050119">They argue strenuously that Congress has already spoken in this case, and that's simply not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.999" offset="12073420">In the FT -- put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.499" offset="12083451">The FTCA and the Westfall Act deal only with Federal employees, the liability of Federal government for actions of Federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.771" offset="12116470">Their argument is essentially that Congress attempted to deal with whether or not private contractors should be liable in these situations by amending a statute that has nothing to do with private contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.781" offset="12172581">And that simply doesn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.150" offset="12181985">It's not -- there is no suggestion here that Congress attempted to address this situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3035.426" offset="12247082">They simply, Congress simply referred to employees of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.480" offset="12271323">And the reason the Court -- excuse me, Congress referred to employees of the United States was because the FTCA only applies, and has always only applied to contractors -- excuse me, of employees of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.490" offset="12327330">There would have been no reason to reach out because it would be totally beyond the specter of the FTCA itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.727" offset="12348332">I think, Your Honor, there is something else to note with regard to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.195" offset="12366200">At most, what we are dealing with here is congressional silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.015" offset="12381456">They suggest that Congress is fit to take care of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.701" offset="12392218">Nobody doubts that Congress is fit to step in and take care of this at some point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.986" offset="12409354">But Cong -- this Court's practice with regards to Bivens has been when Congress steps in, to stand back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.175" offset="12442164">But here we have congressional silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.225" offset="12450314">As this -- as the Court said in 2007, it's most recent Bivens case was, when you are dealing -- well, excuse me -- the Wilkie case did not involve any specific congressional action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.702" offset="12500261">The Court viewed it essentially as congressional silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.119" offset="12509874">The majority of this Court at that time said our evaluation in that instance is to figure out -- excuse me -- whether the Federal courts must make the kind of remedial determination that is appropriate for a common law tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.111" offset="12561910">The Court at that point saw itself as that point as a common law tribunal within the specific circumstance of whether or not a Bivens remedy should be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.217" offset="12598272">That's not to say the Court should adopt some sort of roving common law power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.352" offset="12614781">It's simply to say where there's congressional silence and the case looks almost identical to Carlson, if not identical, that there is sufficient reason for this Court to find a Bivens cause of action here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.327" offset="12662742">If there are no further questions, I urge this Court to affirm the holding of the Ninth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3156.371" offset="12730870">I just wanted to correct one common misimpression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.509" offset="12747483">There is no allegation here that anyone was deliberately starved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.377" offset="12758977">With the allegation regarding the food, his allegation in his complaint is that he, because presumably his arms were in casts, he couldn't hold his tray in the cafeteria and therefore he says I had to buy my own food from the commissary because I didn't want to be humiliated by going to the cafeteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.339" offset="12838808">We think that if that claim somehow stated a claim under the Eighth Amendment for deliberate indifference, that he would state a claim under negligence as well, and all of these claims essentially are that the prison failed to accommodate his injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.115" offset="12897844">Malesko was the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.550" offset="12903591">In Malesko the argument was I didn't get to use an elevator because I had a preexisting condition, and that's what caused my harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.656" offset="12936088">If there is something that negligently causes harm, unreasonably causes harm, there is a remedy in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.275" offset="12958553">I would also note that if it does not cause harm, there is no Bivens remedy, because Congress in the PLRA has said you cannot bring any claim if you are a prisoner in Federal court unless it involves physical harm.</text>

            <text syncTime="3245.429" offset="13087180">And I think one thing that crystallized the argument for me is the colloquy between Justice Scalia and -- and my friend, where I think there was an admission that what they are actually seeking is a blanket cause of action to account for any possible instance in which there is an inadequate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.141" offset="13153949">I think it goes even further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.743" offset="13160427">I think they are asking for a blanket cause of action if somebody can hypothesize an interest -- and issue, and even further than that, even if we can't hypothesize it, maybe somewhere along the line something could happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.717" offset="13208283">We think that's a -- a flipping, a turning Bivens on its head.</text>
