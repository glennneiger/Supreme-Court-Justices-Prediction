            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">We will hear argument next today in Case 10-218, PPL Montana v. Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.950" offset="130215">Mr. Clement.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="7.245" offset="135440">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.761" offset="145471">The State's claim to back rent here is truly remarkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.882" offset="161980">When these dams were built back in the day, PPL's predecessors, Petitioner's predecessors, secured all the necessary property rights and easements.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.847" offset="189879">As part of that process, particularly for the dams that created reservoirs, there was an elaborate process of getting flood easements and in many cases paying substantial amounts of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.121" offset="230943">In that process, nothing was hidden; it was open and notorious.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.494" offset="244423">Indeed, the State assisted by lending the utilities its eminent domain power to deal with holdouts.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.040" offset="266574">But now, 100 years later, the State comes in with a holdout claim of its own and suggests that it's entitled to massive compensation based on the small strip of riverbed that lies underneath these flooded reservoirs and the dams.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.866" offset="317879">The Montana Supreme Court allowed that claim to succeed to the tune of tens of millions of dollars of back rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.797" offset="349644">Now it seems that--</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="61.955" offset="354241">Well, is your point that there should be a Federal rule of -- of laches or estoppel, or are you just building up to the fact that this is traditional, well recognized doctrine and there's been -- and there's been a sudden change?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="73.700" stopTime="121.150">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="73.700" offset="401262">--That's exactly where I was going, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.447" offset="408263">I was suggesting that the Montana Supreme Court could only approve this result, which clearly did unsettle settled expectations, by deviating from well-settled principles of Federal navigability law.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.039" offset="450581">Now, the mistakes were a little bit different for each of the rivers at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.536" offset="464583">As to the Clark Fork and the Upper Missouri, the critical error I believe with the Montana Supreme Court decision was its failure to focus on the river segments that are directly at issue and instead focus on the river as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.530" offset="516514">With the Madison the errors are different, because with the Madison there is no evidence that any stretch of that river was navigable at statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.343" offset="539815">So there the problem was principally that the court relied on modern day evidence of recreational use to substitute for true historic evidence of commercial navigation at statehood.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="121.150" stopTime="152.789">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="121.150" offset="591015">On the issue of whether we should look to the segments or to the river as a whole, what authorities can we consult?</text>
            <text syncTime="129.081" offset="622780">You rely heavily on U.S. v. Utah, and that certainly is a relevant precedent; but there is disagreement about what it means and the only authority that I see that U.S. v. Utah cited was The Montello, which seems to cite nothing whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.950" offset="698222">So where do we -- is that the end of the trail?</text>
            <text syncTime="151.541" offset="712641">Is there anyplace else we can look?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="152.789" stopTime="194.176">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="152.789" offset="717552">Well, I -- I mean, it's close to the end of the trail.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.650" offset="725076">I mean, you can go back to The Daniel Ball, but that's not going to help you any more than The Montello.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.600" offset="740854">I think, though, that the critical cases really are Utah -- but I also think there are other cases that this Court has had -- Oklahoma v. Texas would be an example -- where this Court has looked as a discernible segment of a river.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.237" offset="795397">Brewer-Elliott is another one.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.485" offset="800413">And I think the starting point for the Court's analysis in every one of these cases has been to look at the segment of the river that is at issue, that has been put at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.259" offset="835521">Now, if you have a sovereignty battle between the State and the Federal Government, a lot of times it's the segment of the river within the State, or in Brewer-Elliott it was the segment of the river adjacent to an Indian reservation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="194.176" stopTime="213.810">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="194.176" offset="883169">All of this, I take it, derives from the rule that preexisted -- preexisted the adoption of the Constitution, that the sovereign owned the navigable rivers within its borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.407" offset="936040">Is there some body of common law that addresses this, that would shed some light on whether that means the whole river or it means segments?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="213.810" stopTime="232.348">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="213.810" offset="961640">There really isn't, Justice Alito, because we get our common law from England.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.764" offset="977523">In England actually the common law was different.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.385" offset="987972">At England, the navigable waters ended at the ebb and flow of the tide, so every internal stream within Great Britain was viewed as non-navigable and the property belonged to the riparians.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="232.348" stopTime="242.892">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="232.348" offset="1035828">So what -- what is the origin of the rule that the original 13 States owned the navigable rivers or parts of the rivers, but not the parts that weren't.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.502" offset="1068429">That was some feature of American colonial law?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="242.892" stopTime="327.609">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="242.892" offset="1078042">Sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.516" offset="1080550">I mean, it was -- it was adopted as part of -- the sort of -- just the idea of creating the sovereign republic of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.235" offset="1107404">We borrowed our common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.781" offset="1109598">I think initially nobody focused on these navigable segments.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.808" offset="1129660">And it's important to recognize that this issue really doesn't even arise in the eastern United States, because until about 1850 this idea that States could own the river beds if they were non-navigable never really occurred to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.742" offset="1181383">So in most of the eastern States as a matter of State law, whether a river is navigable or non-navigable, the riparian owns to the middle of the stream bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.113" offset="1218894">So after 1851 this Court recognizes -- makes clear to the States that they actually have a choice, and so the States that come into the Union after 1851, many of them, including Montana, adopt the rule that, well, unless these streams -- if these streams are non-navigable, then we take the river stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.402" offset="1292037">And so that's where the question comes up.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.136" offset="1299038">So maybe the reason there isn't a great deal of precedent on this is explained by the fact that this is an issue that largely arises in the western United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.037" offset="1330594">But that's why I think it's such a mistake to kind of look a gift horse in the mouth, so to speak, and not focus on Utah, because Utah is a situation that seems irreconcilable with the Montana Supreme Court decision and the State's basic theory, because there the special master and this Court recognized a non-navigable segment right in the middle of two navigable portions of stream.</text>

          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="333.997" stopTime="337.869">

            <text syncTime="333.997" offset="1442398">If we can't, some guidance or limit that we set for--</text>

          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="337.869" stopTime="431.316">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="337.869" offset="1457967">--I've thought about this a lot, Justice Sotomayor, and I'm not here to give you a sound bite that's a bright-line definition of "de minimis".</text>
            <text syncTime="343.259" offset="1479492">I think de minimis almost by its nature takes its -- its meaning from the context of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.632" offset="1501017">But let me -- let me offer at least three guideposts that I think are helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.380" offset="1511988">One, as a practical matter I think this Court can look to its own cases dealing with islands in a navigable stream, and those cases are on page 17 of the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.500" offset="1552426">And this Court's cases say if there is a small island in a navigable stream, under an acre, of negligible value, we basically ignore it.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.562" offset="1580743">Later cases, though, came along and dealt with islands that were much larger, and the Court analyzed those separately from the navigable stream, and said the United States actually retains ownership to the larger islands, and they don't go.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.245" offset="1627449">So that's one place to look.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.244" offset="1631420">The second place to look, I think, is also a practical judgment based on the nature of the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.773" offset="1653572">And here the State itself has come in and identified stretches of riverbed that they think are significant enough to generate $50 million in back rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.113" offset="1686904">And I think they, having identified those riverbed stretches as being worth $50 million, are hard pressed to then turn around and say, oh, but they are de minimis, just ignore them.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.359" offset="1715848">The third rule I would point to is that I think topography has something of a role to play here.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.264" offset="1735492">If you look at the special master's report in Utah or some of the other cases that have decided the point at which the navigability stops, they pointed to features of the river as defining a discernible segment like a tributary coming in or the geology of the -- of the bed over which the river runs, if it shifts from kind of a silty loam to hard rock in a canyon, that's something that you can point to.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="431.316" stopTime="500.911">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="431.316" offset="1831727">--I know you've told me that you think Montello is not pertinent because it involved a different issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.031" offset="1858581">But assuming that it were pertinent, because I'm not quite sure how its discussion doesn't fit the needs here, one of the factors you haven't mentioned in terms of de minimis is the portage and its use with respect to commerce; and by that I mean, it appears to me in Montello, what the Court was saying was the history of use of this river showed that these obstructions didn't stop the flow of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.284" offset="1995567">That what people did was -- it appeared some extreme things.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.581" offset="2004762">They got off -- they got their goods off one boat, walked it a certain distance or drove it by wagon another distance and then put it on another boat or the same boat that they had lessened the load on and moved it over.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.120" offset="2078950">And so it doesn't talk about the distance of that portage; it talks about the impact on commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="545.143" offset="2286989">But that's nothing like what's at issue here because those were efforts basically to use the riverbed to -- and they had to do some extraordinary things: an ox to pull the boat; lift them up over some rocks.</text>

            <text syncTime="1031.513" offset="4232485">And so it would make sense to look at the whole river in determining whether it's a highway; and maybe in deciding whether there is a highway, you would look to a bypass stretch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.742" offset="4281386">You would look at the highway, the land highway to decide whether its useful in interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="1593.980" offset="6482359">And under this Court's precedents, it's settled that title to the riverbeds is conveyed to the State under the Constitution if they are navigable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1608.177" offset="6539201">PPL's deeds -- and this is at page 172 of the appendix to the opposition brief -- specifically exclude the riverbeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.755" offset="6577445">The test for navigability that this Court has applied for 140 years, going back to The Montello and The Daniel Ball, is whether the river served as a continuous highway of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.889" offset="6610045">In The Montello, the Court recognized the fact that few of the nation's great rivers did not include some, quote, "serious interruptions to uninterrupted navigation".</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.230" offset="6651319">And the -- and the Court's answer to that geographic fact was not to say then let's carve out the interruptions and say those aren't navigable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3534.920" offset="14246160">--Well, look at footnote 3 of the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.355" offset="14259848">I mean, again, the problem here is if you want people to have deeds that really are -- parse out whether it's riverbed or upland, they don't because everybody defaults to the bottom line -- the background rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.773" offset="14305510">The background rule is if it's a non-navigable river, the riparian owners, whether it be the United States or private property owners, get to midway, or if they own both on both sides, they get the whole thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.642" offset="14345007">I think on de minimis, we've talked about it a lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.645" offset="14348978">But I would point out that the one thing we know that is not de minimis from Utah is 4.35 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.455" offset="14372279">Because that's what the Court analyzed separately in the portion of Cataract Canyon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.530" offset="14396520">Every stretch at issue here, every dam at issue here, is more than 4.35 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.122" offset="14410940">Fully five of the dams are on the 17-mile Great Falls stretch, which they agree is impassable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.788" offset="14441556">The other five are reservoir dams that create reservoirs that extend over 4.35 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.908" offset="14462036">There's nothing de minimis in the best evidence that is the $50 million in compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.175" offset="14479172">I think the $50 million in background also shows that although this is a dispute between Montana and the United States, my client is caught in the middle of it, and they are obviously concerned about it, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.765" offset="14513549">I want to talk about what's disputed and what's undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.404" offset="14536014">What is undisputed is the 17 miles is impassable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.465" offset="14548344">That's enough, as I say, to give us judgment as a matter of law for the five dams on that stretch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.057" offset="14562659">What is hotly disputed, despite my friend's representation, is whether or not there was through commerce through this bypass route.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.490" offset="14592439">He suggests it's undisputed that gold went from Helena down to Fort Benton down to St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.865" offset="14609889">And that of course is not disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.833" offset="14621800">But it went on roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.362" offset="14627861">It didn't go on the upper Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.469" offset="14640295">And if you want to know who's got the better of this argument, I ask you to think about this question: the United States Army built a 600-mile overland road from Fort Benton, the traditional head of navigation on the Missouri, to Walla Walla, Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.275" offset="14699541">Now, if the State is right and the upper Missouri and the Clark Fork were navigable, all they had to do was have a 60-mile road to connect the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.788" offset="14733605">They were never navigable.</text>
