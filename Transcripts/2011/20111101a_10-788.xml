            <text syncTime="8.670" offset="141082">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.491" offset="156442">This Court has twice held, in Malley and in Kalina, that a complaining witness who sets a criminal prosecution in motion by submitting a false affidavit is entitled to qualified immunity, but not absolute immunity, in an action under section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.567" offset="212762">The Court rested that conclusion on its determination that complaining witnesses were subject to damages liability at common law when -- in 1871 when section 1983 was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.373" offset="255916">The question in this case is whether the rule of Malley and Kalina also applies to a complaining witness who sets a prosecution in motion by testifying before a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.397" offset="296040">Again, the common law provides the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.016" offset="310460">The law is clear that in 1871 damages liability could be based on false grand jury testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="57.270" offset="335538">The problem I have with your argument is that I don't really know what a complaining witness is in the grand jury context.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.706" offset="365317">Let's take the Federal grand jury as an example.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="78.366" offset="419861">A complaining witness I would think is a person who files a complaint, who causes -- in the Federal system it would be someone who files a complaint and attests to it under Rule 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.424" offset="472106">That person is asking that charges be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.795" offset="485585">That's what it means to be a complaining witness, filing a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.930" offset="498124">Nobody -- no witness before a Federal grand jury asks that an indictment be returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.583" offset="524769">They provide testimony, and they may want an indictment to be returned, but it's the prosecutor who asks for the indictment to be returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.839" offset="557787">So I don't see how there is a complaining witness in that sense in the traditional grand jury context.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Pincus</label>
            <text syncTime="118.343" offset="579835">Well, Your Honor, the common law confronted precisely the same situation, and after public prosecutors came into being and when grand juries were empaneled by them, the common law concluded that, both in 1871 and in the present, that there can be a person who is the motivating force behind the prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="138.824" offset="661755">What -- what if you have three elements to a crime, and you have one witness for each one.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.142" offset="678996">You see somebody sees the guy trying to get into a car.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.077" offset="690803">Well, maybe he left it -- maybe he locked his keys in.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.879" offset="701983">Another sees the guy walking around with a television.</text>

            <text syncTime="159.404" offset="744093">Well, Your Honor, at -- at common law the complaining witness was more than just someone who gave evidence that was necessary for the warrant or the indictment to issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.293" offset="787665">It was someone who was pushing for the prosecution to be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.164" offset="803129">All of these problems, of course, occurred at common law and they also occur in connection with the circumstances that the Court addressed in Malley and Kalina.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.385" offset="847956">Well, let me give you another example that I think happens with some frequency.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.006" offset="862480">You have a Federal grand jury and you have testimony by an FBI or a DEA case agent, a person who's been working on the case, and that witness provides a lot of information supporting the charges that the prosecutor wants returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.747" offset="917441">You also have a cooperating witness, someone who has entered into a plea bargain and in exchange for that is providing a lot of incriminating testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.120" offset="950878">Now, is there a complaining witness in that situation?</text>

            <text syncTime="1497.835" offset="6097836">And our second position would be, even if you, the Court, thought that grand jury testimony for some reason was off limits but became permissible as a basis for finding liability if there were other evidence, then that's true in this case as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.030" offset="6170561">I want to return to Justice Breyer's question for 1 minute, because there was the third policy reason that I wanted to provide, which is, as we explain in our brief, in the States many prosecutors can proceed by information or indictment, and that we think it would be a peculiar situation if liability could be premised when a proceeding is initiated by information, which Malley and Kalina make clear, but that if the proceeding is by grand jury it would be wholly off limits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3231.209" offset="13031257">And perhaps that's not my position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.510" offset="13044527">First of all, I'm not saying that they're -- what I'm saying with respect to bringing a malicious prosecution claim is that, I think Justice Scalia asked me if there is a completely independent act, but if -- in the scenario that you paint, just the fact that they've talked outside the grand jury, that does not authorize an independent cause of action for a malicious prosecution claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.643" offset="13140971">What you have to have is an independent act, just like what you had at common law where you had two distinct acts: one, where you actually filed the complaint; now you become the complainant or as the common law said you became the complaining witness even if you didn't have to be a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.972" offset="13226339">But then if you were a witness, indeed, that testimony that you gave in the -- in the grand jury or in the trial could be used as to -- to prove your malicious intent in bringing the charge initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.020" offset="13298542">And that -- that doesn't equate to what we have here in this -- in this scenario.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.090" offset="13322783">What we have here is there may have been a discussion outside of the court or outside of the grand jury, but that discussion now ended and now you have an independent act by the prosecutor to bring the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.016" offset="13382552">So it's a completely distinct, as I see it, completely distinct scenarios.</text>

            <text syncTime="3336.911" offset="13454127">A couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.378" offset="13459978">First of all, the -- the question about whether there -- it's an appropriate rule that a finding of complaining witness can be based on evidence outside of the grand jury, but it can't be based on grand jury testimony, that certainly wasn't the common law rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.158" offset="13539077">And I note Justice Sotomayor asked whether there were any common law cases that relied solely on grand jury testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.562" offset="13564677">And although the cases are hard to parse, I would point the Court to the Anderson and the Moulton cases that we cite on page 3 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.501" offset="13600413">In those cases, in the Anderson case the Court is talking about the charge to the jury, and what it says the evidence was is the fact that the defendant was listed as the complainant on the indictment and that he testified before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.413" offset="13676063">And then in the Moulton case the allegations of the complaint are set forth in the reporting of the case, and the only allegations are -- relate to the testimony before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.118" offset="13714934">So I think it's very hard to find any basis in the common law which as the Court said -- has said is the controlling principle here for ruling the grand jury testimony either entirely out of bounds as a basis for liability, or for saying it's only in bounds if there is some other extrinsic evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.399" offset="13788076">There is just no support for that in the common law, and I think it doesn't really make sense -- if this case had proceeded by information, and Mr. Paulk's grand jury testimony had simply been placed in an affidavit and submitted in order to obtain the arrest warrant, Malley and Kalina would control and it would be clear that there would be liability--</text>
