            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">In case 11-182, Justice Kennedy has the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.888" offset="130006">The case is Arizona versus United States.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="9.476" offset="144321">The State of Arizona has enacted a statute called the Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.332" offset="167727">The law is often called in the pleadings and in the opinion S. B. 1070.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.689" offset="193223">It is designed, in the words of the statute, to discourage and deter the unlawful entry and presence of economic activity by persons unlawfully present in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.131" offset="235018">The question before the Court is whether four different provisions of the state law are preempted and rendered invalid by federal immigration law.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.230" offset="267410">The federal power to determine immigration policy is well settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.298" offset="283606">Immigration policy can affect trade, investment, tourism, and diplomatic relations for the entire nation as well as the perceptions and expectations of aliens in this country, who seek full protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.260" offset="343479">Federal statutes and regulations include detailed rules concerning when aliens may enter the country, how -- how they must register, whether they may work, and under what circumstances they maybe removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.244" offset="395410">This pervasive federal law does not diminish the importance of immigration policy to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.429" offset="420174">In Arizona, each year hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens are apprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.541" offset="444625">Evidence in this record suggests that crime, property damage, and serious environmental problems are caused by the influx of illegal migration across the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.023" offset="482555">These concerns are the background for the legal analysis in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.557" offset="504707">Now the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution gives Congress the power to preempt state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.557" offset="528635">There are subject areas where federal regulation is so extensive or the federal interest is so dominant that it may be inferred that Congress intended to displace state law altogether and this is called, field preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.581" offset="584746">State laws will also be found invalid if they conflict with federal law and this includes situations where state law stands as an obstacle to the full objectives of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.524" offset="632498">The four disputed provisions of S. B. 1070 must be evaluated accorded -- according to these principles and the first provision to be discussed is Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.667" offset="681085">This part of S. B. 1070 makes it a misdemeanor, a state law misdemeanor, not to comply with federal laws requiring aliens to complete and carry registration papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.307" offset="727688">In the 1941 case of Hines versus Davidowitz, the Court discussed then applicable federal alien registration requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.915" offset="766140">The framework Congress had established at that time was described as a complete system for alien registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.360" offset="803861">In Hines, the 1941 case, the Court held that states could -- could not complement federal law or could not enforce additional or auxiliary regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.224" offset="851299">Today, the federal framework of alien registration rules remains comprehensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.250" offset="871466">Under the Hines case and based on field preemption, federal law does bar the additional enforcement mechanism provided in Section 3 and Section 3 of the Arizona law is preempted by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.547" offset="928622">The next provision to be discussed is Section 5(C).</text>
            <text syncTime="208.917" offset="942101">Now this Section makes it a misdemeanor for an alien in Arizona to seek or engage in unauthorized work, the penalties on the perspective or the actual employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.562" offset="1004690">Penalties include incarceration for up to six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.473" offset="1020364">Now, in 1986 Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act known as IRCA as a comprehensive framework for combating the employment of illegal aliens and that law, the federal law requires employers to verify the status of their workers and it punishes violations with civil and criminal penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.089" offset="1114823">The unauthorized employees on the other hand are generally, under the federal law, subject only to civil penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.164" offset="1147110">Congress debated and rejected proposals to impose criminal penalties on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.953" offset="1170307">The correct instruction to draw from the text, design, and history of the IRCA is that Congress decided these penalties would be inappropriate but authorizing them in Section 5(C) of the Arizona law upsets the careful balance struck by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.682" offset="1241151">It stands as an obstacle to federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.574" offset="1252749">Section 5(C) is preempted by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.827" offset="1269781">The next Section to be discussed is Section 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.456" offset="1284305">Now, this Section gives state police officers authority to arrest without a warrant certain aliens who are suspected of being removable from this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.374" offset="1331952">As a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.661" offset="1361105">When an alien is suspected of being removable, a federal official issues a notice for him or her to appear at a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.947" offset="1398199">Congress has specified circumstances when it is appropriate for federal immigration officers to arrest an alien during the removal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.348" offset="1435815">Without a federal warrant, these federal officers have limited authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.971" offset="1458280">Section 6 of the state law gives state officers greater authority to arrest aliens on the basis of possible removability than Congress has given to trained federal immigration officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.032" offset="1502584">And Section 6 gives state officers the power to make these arrests without any instruction or direction from the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.849" offset="1533827">This conflicts with federal -- the federal statutory framework which identifies narrow circumstances when state officers may perform the functions of an immigration officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.665" offset="1577085">Now, in defense of Section 6, Arizona notes that a federal statute permits state officers to cooperate with the Attorney General in the detention and removal of aliens not lawfully present in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.216" offset="1643332">Now there is some ambiguity as to what constitutes cooperation, but no coherent understanding of that term could include what Section 6 authorizes, unilateral state action to arrest and detain aliens based on their possible removability.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.747" offset="1709474">Section 6 of the Arizona law is preempted by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.200" offset="1731208">The last Section to be discussed is Section 2(B) of the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.456" offset="1752315">This requires state officers to make a reasonable attempt to verify the immigration status of anyone they stop, detain, or arrest if there is a reasonable suspicion that the person is unlawfully present in united -- in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.109" offset="1814904">The state law also provides that any person who is arrested shall have the person's immigration status determined before the person is released.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.810" offset="1845729">By a well established procedure, these state inquiries can be and are directed to a federal agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.381" offset="1875926">The challengers to the state law argue that Section 2(B) conflicts with federal law because the status checks are made mandatory, but federal law does not suggest that it is inappropriate enough for state officers to contact immigration and customs enforcement as a routine matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.241" offset="1943427">Instead, federal law encourages the sharing of the information about possible immigration violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.584" offset="1968818">One concern is that under state law, officers will be required to delay the release of some detainees for no reason other than to verify their immigration status, but Section 2(B) can be read to avoid this concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.843" offset="2029840">If the provision only requires state officers to conduct the status check during the course of an authorized lawful detention or after a detainee has been released, the provision would likely survive preemption at least absent some showing that it has other consequences that are adverse to federal law in its objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.937" offset="2118238">Without a definitive interpretation from the state courts, it would be inappropriate to assume at this point that the law will be construed in a way that conflicts with federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.900" offset="2166094">The Court's opinion does not foreclose other preemption and constitutional challenges to the law after it goes into effect, but in this case, Section 2(B) survives preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.187" offset="2207159">The national government has significant power to regulate immigration.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.534" offset="2232550">With power comes responsibility and the sound exercise of national power over immigration depends on the nation's meeting its responsibility to base its laws on a political will, informed by searching thoughtful, rational, civic discourse.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.577" offset="2304752">Arizona may have understandable frustrations with the problems caused by illegal immigration while that process continues, but the state may not pursue policies that undermine federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.483" offset="2348325">Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito had each filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.615" offset="2384896">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
