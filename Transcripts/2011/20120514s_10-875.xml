            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Justice Sotomayor has our opinion this morning in case 10-875, Hall versus United States, and in her absence, I will announce the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.751" offset="144447">Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code allows farmer debtors with regular annual income to adjust their debts subject to a reorganization plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.024" offset="185511">Petitioners Lynwood and Brenda Hall filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy and then sold their farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.671" offset="212156">The IRS asserted a tax on the capital gains from the postpetition sale of the farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.424" offset="239114">Now the Halls and the IRS disagreed over how to treat the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.944" offset="257191">Their disagreement concerns whether postpetition income taxes are eligible for priority stripping treatment under 11, United States Code, Section 1222(a)(2)(A).</text>
            <text syncTime="51.124" offset="309959">Now ordinarily, a Chapter 12 plan must provide for full payment of priority claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.892" offset="332946">Section 1222(a)(2)(A) however, carves out an exception whereby certain governmental claims arising from the disposition of farm assets are stripped of priority status and downgraded to dischargeable, unsecured claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.789" offset="400551">Now the Halls argue that their postpetition income taxes are eligible for the priority stripping treatment of Section 1222(a)(2)(A).</text>
            <text syncTime="84.017" offset="441511">The IRS on the other hand argues that 1222(a)(2)(A) applies only to claims entitled to priority in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.155" offset="482053">The IRS contends that the Halls' postpetition income taxes do not so qualify and thus are neither collectible nor dischargeable in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.628" offset="523954">The bankruptcy court sided with the IRS, but the District Court reversed, but then the Ninth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.515" offset="551434">The Ninth Circuit agreed with the IRS that postpetition income taxes are not a priority claim eligible for the Section 1222(a)(2)(A) exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.758" offset="596470">We now affirm the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.421" offset="607128">The parties agree that Section 1222(a)(2)(A) applies only to priority claims and that postpetition income taxes so qualify only if they constitute, and here's a quote, “tax incurred by the estate” under Section 503(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="143.278" offset="678494">So the dispositive question is whether these taxes are incurred by the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.062" offset="701691">For the reasons we explain in our opinion filed today, we hold that the Halls' postpetition income taxes are not incurred by the estate and are neither collectible nor dischargeable in the Chapter 12 plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.637" offset="755921">A tax incurred by the estate is a tax for which the estate itself is liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.712" offset="780267">Provisions of the Internal Revenue Code establish that only certain estates are liable for federal income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.866" offset="808897">Based on those provisions, a Chapter 12 estate is not a separate taxable entity and only the debtor, not the estate, can incur the tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.620" offset="851947">Now we note that established understandings in Chapter 13 hold that postpetition income taxes are not incurred by the estate within the meaning of Section 503(b), because the taxes are the liability of the Chapter 13 debtor alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.851" offset="912865">We decline to adopt a conflicting position in Chapter 12 which was modeled on Chapter 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.391" offset="938987">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.472" offset="955288">Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Kennedy, Ginsburg, and Kagan join.</text>
