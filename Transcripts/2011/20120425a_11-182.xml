            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106011">We'll hear argument this morning in Case 11-182, Arizona v. the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.070" offset="130253">Mr. Clement.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="7.054" offset="134223">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="10.022" offset="146031">The State of Arizona bears a disproportionate share of the costs of illegal immigration.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.693" offset="168705">In addressing those costs, Arizona borrowed the Federal standards as its own, and attempted to enlist State resources in the enforcement of the uniform Federal immigration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.900" offset="217606">Notwithstanding that, the United States took the extraordinary step of seeking a preliminary injunction to enjoin the statute as impliedly preempted on its face before it took effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.375" offset="259507">The Ninth Circuit agreed with respect to four provisions, but only by inverting fundamental principles of federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.029" offset="286047">The Ninth Circuit essentially demanded that Arizona point to specific authorization in Federal statute for its approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.949" offset="317707">But that gets matters backwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.401" offset="327529">A State does not need to point to Federal authorization for its enforcement efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.705" offset="348741">Rather, the burden is on the parties seeking to preempt a duly enacted State law to point to some provision in statutory law that does the preempting.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.894" offset="385521">Now, the United States can't really do that here, and the reason is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.798" offset="401195">There are multiple provisions of the Federal immigration law that go out of their way to try to facilitate State and local efforts to communicate with Federal immigration officials in order to ascertain the immigration status of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.772" offset="457097">So, for example, 1373(c) specifically requires that Federal immigration officials shall respond to inquiries from State and local officials about somebody's immigration status.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.080" offset="506311">1373(a) goes even further.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.782" offset="517074">That provision says that no Federal agency or officer may prohibit or in any way restrict the ability of State and local officers to communicate with Federal immigration officers to ascertain somebody's immigration status.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.875" offset="573498">Indeed, if the DHS had--</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="119.877" offset="585515">--could I interrupt, and turning to 2(B), could you tell me what the State's view is -- the Government proposes that it should be read on its face one way, and I think the State is arguing that there's a narrower way to read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.205" offset="650821">But am I to understand that under the State's position in this action, the only time that the inquiry about the status of an individual rises is after they've had probable cause to arrest that individual for some other crime?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="152.381" stopTime="168.926">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="152.381" offset="715500">That's exactly right, Justice Sotomayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.416" offset="723650">So this only operates when somebody's been essentially stopped for some other infraction, and then at that point, if there's reasonable suspicion to try to identify immigration status, then that can happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.391" offset="775477">Of course, one of the things that--</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="170.443" offset="787702">--just stop you there just one moment?</text>
            <text syncTime="172.045" offset="794181">That's what I thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.128" offset="798465">So presumably, I think your argument is, that under any circumstance, a police officer would have the discretion to make that call.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.102" offset="842351">Seems to me that the issue is not about whether you make the call or not, although the Government is arguing that it might be, but on how long you detain the individual, meaning -- as I understand it, when individuals are arrested and held for other crimes, often there's an immigration check that most States do without this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.837" offset="945273">And to the extent that the government wants to remove that individual, they put in a warrant of detainer.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.257" offset="979023">This process is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.109" offset="986442">How is it different?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="221.293" stopTime="243.139">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="221.293" offset="991144">Well, it's different in one important respect, Justice Sotomayor, and that's why I don't think that the issue that divides the parties is only the issue of how long you can detain somebody.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.398" offset="1027507">Because I think the Federal Government takes the rather unusual position that even though these stops and these inquiries, if done on an ad hoc basis, become preempted if they're done on a systematic basis--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="243.139" stopTime="246.358">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>

            <text syncTime="244.908" offset="1085603">I can question them about that.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.374" offset="1095425">But I want to get to how -- assuming your position, that doing it on a -- there's nothing wrong with doing it as it's been done in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.216" offset="1138788">Whenever anyone is detained, a call could be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.501" offset="1151954">What I see as critical is the issue of how long, and under -- and when is the officer going to exercise discretion to release the person?</text>

            <text syncTime="270.274" offset="1187062">--And with respect, I don't think section 2(B) really speaks to that, which is to say, I don't think section 2(B) says that the systematic inquiry has to take any longer than the ad hoc inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.664" offset="1236591">And, indeed, section 2 -- in one of its provisions -- specifically says that it has to be implemented in a way that's consistent with Federal, both immigration law and civil rights law.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.520" offset="1280058">So, there--</text>

            <text syncTime="304.945" offset="1325720">No, we don't want to detain him.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.697" offset="1332721">What does the law say, the Arizona law say, with respect to releasing that individual?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="312.534" offset="1356127">--Well, I don't know that it speaks to it in specific terms, but here's what I believe would happen, which is to say, at that point, then, the officer would ask themselves whether there's any reason to continue to detain the person for State law purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.360" offset="1411402">I mean, it could be that the original offense that the person was pulled over needs to be dealt with or something like that.</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="332.180" offset="1434703">But -- but if what we're talking about is simply what happens then for purposes of the Federal immigration consequences, the answer is nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.434" offset="1463647">The individual at that point is released.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.536" offset="1472111">And that, I think, can be very well illustrated by section 6 -- I don't want to change the subject unnecessarily, but there is arrest authority for somebody who has committed a public offense, which means that it's a crime in another State and in Arizona, but the person can't be arrested for that offense presumably because they have already served their sentence for the offense; and then there is new arrest authority given to the officer to hold that person if they are deportable for that offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.484" offset="1571898">Now, I think in that circumstance, it's very clear what would happen, is an inquiry would be made to the Federal officials that would say, do you want us to transfer this person to your custody or hold this person until you can take custody?</text>
            <text syncTime="378.209" offset="1618814">And if the answer is no, then that's the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.994" offset="1629890">That individual is released, because there is no independent basis in that situation for the State officer to continue to detain the individual at all.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>

            <text syncTime="398.770" offset="1701048">Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think there's two answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.472" offset="1711810">One is, you're right, sometimes it's a complex inquiry, sometimes it's a straightforward inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.192" offset="1730723">It could be murder, it could be a drug crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.958" offset="1737828">But I think the practical answer to the question is by hypothesis there is going to be inquiry made to the Federal immigration authorities, either the Law Enforcement Support Center or a 287(g) officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.285" offset="1791118">And presumably, as a part of that inquiry, they can figure out whether or not this is a removable offense or at least a substantially likely removable offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="699.862" offset="2905397">We don't anticipate that Section 2(B) would elongate in a significant number of cases the detention or the arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="710.235" offset="2946880">And the reason is, as I indicated, it's something that happens even without this law that, when you arrest somebody, and there are some offenses that are -- you can arrest and release under State law, but before you release the individual, you generally want to ascertain that that individual is going to show up at the hearing, and that's what really distinguishes those cases where there's arrest and release from those cases where there's arrest and you book somebody.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.619" offset="3052414">Now, here's the other reason why I don't think factually this is going to elongate things.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.506" offset="3067983">Because already in a significant number of booking facilities in Arizona, you already have the process that people are systematically run through immigration checks when they are booked as part of the booking process.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.147" offset="3122527">That's reflected in the record here in the Maricopa County system, that that's done by a 287(g) officer as a matter of routine.</text>

            <text syncTime="766.538" offset="3172160">And their Secure Communities program also makes clear that everybody's that's booked at participating facilities is -- eventually has their immigration status checked.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.596" offset="3208313">And so I don't think that this immigration status check is likely to lead to a substantial elongation of the stops or the detentions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1735.251" offset="7046955">Because although there is some general discussion there of field preemption, when the Court actually states what its holding is, it does state it in terms of obstacle preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.539" offset="7084153">And here's where I think there is a critical difference between what the Court had before it in Hines and what you have before you here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.426" offset="7107663">In Hines, Pennsylvania passed its statute before Congress passed the alien registration statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.247" offset="7130964">So not surprisingly, you know, they weren't -- they weren't soothsayers in Pennsylvania.</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.151" offset="7154579">So when it got up here, there was a conflict between the provisions of the Pennsylvania registration law and the Federal registration law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.155" offset="7182582">And this Court struck it down on that preemption basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.757" offset="7193031">Here it's quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.790" offset="7197107">Arizona had before it the Federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.709" offset="7208809">It looked at the precise provisions in the Federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.161" offset="7222602">It adopted those standards as its own, and then it imposed parallel penalties for the violation of the State equivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.766" offset="7253009">And so I think the right analysis is really the analysis that this Court laid out in its Whiting decision, which says that in these kinds of cases, what you look for is whether or not the State scheme directly interferes with the operation of the Federal scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="3276.111" offset="13210390">And 1357 is the provision that sets forth the powers and authorities of Federal immigration officials.</text>

            <text syncTime="3301.161" offset="13310595">Then the last provision, (g)(10), says that nothing that we've said so far should be read to preclude informal cooperation, communication or other informal cooperation in the apprehension, detention and removal of unlawfully present persons; but, it's the focus on cooperation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3447.738" offset="13896888">And the way in which those terms are enforced does have very significant Federal interest at its heart, and there is no state police power interest in that Federal registration relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="4133.912" offset="16641626">First is, I don't think it's realistic to assume that the aggressive enforcement of sections 3 and 5 in Arizona is going to lead to a mass migration back to countries of origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="4148.689" offset="16700767">It seems a far more likely outcome is going to be migration to other States.</text>

            <text syncTime="4168.770" offset="16781015">Between 60 and 70 percent of the people that we remove every year, we remove to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.773" offset="16805048">And in addition, we have to have the cooperation of the Mexicans.</text>

            <text syncTime="4287.230" offset="17254876">The -- I do think the fundamental point about section 5 here is that in 1986, Congress fundamentally changed the landscape.</text>
            <text syncTime="4298.351" offset="17299389">Congress made a decision in 1986 to make the employment of aliens a central concern of national immigration policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4305.691" offset="17328751">And this Court has described the 1986 law as a comprehensive regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="4310.928" offset="17349649">Now, what my friend, Mr. Clement, says, is that it may be a comprehensive regime for employers; it's not a comprehensive regime for employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4320.717" offset="17388832">And therefore, it's -- there ought not be any inference here that the States are precluded from criminalizing efforts to seek or obtain employment in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.240" offset="17430942">But I really think that's not right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4333.025" offset="17438047">The -- employment is one problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4336.043" offset="17450168">And Congress tackled the problem of employment and made a decision, a comprehensive decision, about the sanctions it thought were appropriate to govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="4345.066" offset="17486217">And Congress did, as Justice Ginsburg suggested, make judgments with respect to the circumstances under which employees could be held criminally liable, as well as the circumstances under which employers could be held liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4358.076" offset="17538253">And I think it is useful in thinking about the judgments Congress actually made--</text>

            <text syncTime="4365.463" offset="17567823">I think we're making both a field and a conflict preemption argument here, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="4369.365" offset="17583392">And the -- I think it's worth examining the specific judgments Congress made in 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="4376.887" offset="17613485">On the employer's side -- and, after all, this is a situation in which the concern here is that the employer is in a position of being the exploiter and the alien of being the exploited -- on the employer's side, Congress said that States may not impose criminal sanctions, and even -- and the Federal Government will not impose criminal sanctions for the hiring of employees unless there's a pattern or practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4399.034" offset="17702093">It seems quite incongruous to think that Congress, having made that judgment and imposed those restrictions on the employer's side, would have left States free to impose criminal liability on employees merely for seeking work, for doing what you I think would expect most otherwise law-abiding people to do, which is to find a job so they can feed their families.</text>
            <text syncTime="4417.447" offset="17775758">So I think that's a significant problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4419.980" offset="17785893">In addition, Congress made clear in the law that the I-9 form could not be used for any other purpose than prosecutions for violation of the Federal antifraud requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4432.624" offset="17836467">And if Congress wanted to leave States free to impose criminal sanctions on employees for seeking work, they wouldn't have done that, it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="4440.278" offset="17867082">So that I think there are strong indicators in the text that Congress did make a judgment, and the judgment was this far and no farther.</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.134" offset="17898533">And it's reasonable that Congress would have done so, for the same kinds of foreign relations concerns that I was discussing with respect to section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="4455.989" offset="17929880">It would be an extraordinary thing to put someone in jail merely for seeking work.</text>
            <text syncTime="4461.893" offset="17953495">And yet that's what Arizona proposes to do under section 5 of its law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4466.178" offset="17970631">Now, of course, there is an express preemption provision, but the express preemption provision, as this Court has said many times, does not operate to the exclusion of implied preemption, field or conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="4477.669" offset="18016607">So we do think those principles apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4480.038" offset="18026115">We think there's a reason why the express preemption provision was limited to the employer's side, which is that after DeCanas laws had been enacted on the employer's side, and with -- Congress was making clear that those were preemptive, there were no laws on the employee's side at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4493.246" offset="18078987">And therefore, no reason for preemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="4498.366" offset="18099467">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="4502.101" offset="18114409">I'd like to start briefly with the enforcement issues and then talk about the other provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4507.172" offset="18134680">The last thing I'll say about the enforcement provision, since I do think that the Government's rather unusual theory that something that's okay when done ad hoc becomes preempted when it's systematic, I think that theory largely refutes itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4518.813" offset="18181178">But I will say one thing, which is to just echo that there is no interference with enforcement priorities by simply giving the Federal Government information on which to bring their enforcement priorities to bear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4529.288" offset="18223079">And this is really illustrated by a point this Court made in its Florence decision earlier this month, which is that sometimes you pull somebody over for the most innocuous of infractions and they turn out to be the most serious of offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.445" offset="18275742">And so if you preclude officers, as happened in Phoenix, from communicating with the Federal Government, the Federal Government will not be able to identify the worst of the worst.</text>
            <text syncTime="4552.801" offset="18317120">And if you want an example of this, look at the declaration of Officer Brett Glidewell at Joint Appendix 183 to 186.</text>
            <text syncTime="4559.640" offset="18344496">He pulled somebody over in a routine traffic stop and was shot by the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="4564.175" offset="18362677">Now, the individual it turns out was wanted for attempted murder in El Salvador and was also guilty of illegal reentry into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4571.198" offset="18390785">He was stopped on three previous occasions and his status was not verified.</text>
            <text syncTime="4575.900" offset="18409593">Now, if it had been, he certainly would have been apprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="4578.601" offset="18420355">In at least two of the stops, his immigration status wasn't checked because of the city policy, City of Phoenix.</text>
            <text syncTime="4584.422" offset="18443657">Now, if the State, I submit, can do anything, it can at the State level override those kind of local policies and say, that's not what we want.</text>
            <text syncTime="4592.028" offset="18474063">Community policing is all well and good, but we want to maximize communication with the Federal authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4597.432" offset="18495693">So I think the enforcement policy and priorities argument simply doesn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.134" offset="18510530">As to section 3, two points about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4604.102" offset="18522338">One is, I respectfully disagree with the Solicitor General as to whether the various things that he led off -- read off, the litany of situations where somebody is -- technically doesn't have registration would be a violation of 1306(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="4619.028" offset="18582106">And the reason I take that position is that provision says a willful failure to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="4624.849" offset="18605407">Now, maybe the prosecutors take the view that there is willfulness in those circumstances, but I don't think many judges would.</text>
            <text syncTime="4630.903" offset="18629544">I think they would say that if you've been told by the Federal Government that you're perfectly fine here and you don't need to register, that that would be good enough to defeat a finding of willfulness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4639.175" offset="18662667">So I don't think 1306(a) covers this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4747.411" offset="19095569">One, if there is some sloppiness in the way the Federal Government keeps its records so that there's lots of people that really should be registered but aren't, I can't imagine that sloppiness has a preemptive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.686" offset="19136738">The second thing I would say is that I do think, in thinking about section 3 in particular, the analogy is not the fraud on the FDA claim in Buckman, it's really the State tort law that says that it's a violation of State tort law to not even seek the approval that's needed under the FDA for a device.</text>
            <text syncTime="4776.214" offset="19210821">Now, States impose tort law for people that market a device without getting the necessary approval, and nobody thinks that's preempted, because it serves the Federal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4785.319" offset="19247183">It doesn't have a deluge of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="4787.188" offset="19254707">It forces people to get FDA approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.890" offset="19265469">And in the same way, this State law will force people to register, which is what the Federal Government is supposed to want in the first place, so there is no preemption there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4797.144" offset="19294517">There is no conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="4798.163" offset="19298592">As to the employment provision, I do think it's important to recognize that--</text>
