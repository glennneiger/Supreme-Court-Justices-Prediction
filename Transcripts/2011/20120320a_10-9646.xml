            <text syncTime="11.808" offset="153464">In Graham v. Florida, this Court recognized that children are inherently characterized by internal attributes and external circumstances that preclude a finding of a degree of culpability that would make a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole constitutionally permissible under the Court's Eighth Amendment excessiveness analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.504" offset="244162">While the issue in Graham involved juveniles that were convicted of non-homicide offenses, these deficits in maturity and judgment and decisionmaking are not crime-specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.629" offset="288674">All children are encumbered with the same barriers that this Court has found to be constitutionally relevant before imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment without parole or the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.603" offset="336635">In fact, in Roper, this Court acknowledged that these differences between children and adults exist even in the cases involving the most aggravated murders.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.575" offset="376446">These deficits, these differences, are even more pronounced in young children.</text>

            <text syncTime="72.796" offset="397344">Mr. Stevenson, but in Roper, the Court also made the point -- when it ruled out the death penalty, it said,</text>
            <text syncTime="87.972" offset="458052">"To the extent the juvenile death penalty might have residual deterrent effect, it is worth noting that the punishment of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole is itself a severe sanction. "</text>
            <text syncTime="101.966" offset="514059">So, the Court in Roper seemed to be anticipating this case and suggesting that -- that it was all right, it was constitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="113.789" offset="561288">There's no question, Justice Ginsburg, that the -- the default sentence in Roper was life imprisonment without parole, but we actually think that, specifically with regard to that provision, there is no greater deterrent effect, and these deficits, that these problems that children experience, lend themselves to an analysis that is subject when the punishment is life imprisonment without parole.</text>

            <text syncTime="789.244" offset="3263185">And that's because the -- the transfer question, which is what informs whether children can be subject to these sentences or not, is a very different question.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.199" offset="3290979">It's a question about whether the juvenile system that may mandate release at age 18 or age 21 is adequate for an offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.969" offset="3322013">It's not a judgment that that child should therefore be subject to life imprisonment without parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.607" offset="3344583">And so, you have this disconnect.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.392" offset="3351793">You have transfer judgments, which this Court recognized in Thompson and in Graham were not proxies for sentencing judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.779" offset="3377288">And because of that, it is a very different calculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.565" offset="3388468">The second point is that if there is no minimum age for trying children as adults or even prosecuting children as adults, I think we'd have to concede that there is an age at which a life without parole sentence would be constitutionally impermissible for any crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.924" offset="3449908">And to the extent that the State hasn't addressed that, which they clearly haven't -- you know, in this cohort of 79 children with life without parole for crimes at 14 and younger, more than half come from States where there's no minimum age for trying children as adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.084" offset="3502571">That means in that State, a 10-year-old child would arguably have been contemplated by the legislature to be an appropriate person for life without parole, or an 8-year-old child and a 6-year-old child, and I think that asks too much of these statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1550.205" offset="6306973">Imposing life without parole sentences on aggravated murder offenders like Evan Miller is in line with the national consensus, is morally justified, and is consistent with legitimate penological goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.929" offset="6353889">I'd like to touch on all three of those points at some juncture today if I can, but I'd like to start if I can with the conversation Mr. Stevenson was having with a few of the Justices about the national consensus issue in this case and more particularly what we can infer about the judgment of legislatures and ultimately the people based on the statutes we have in this case and the very different set of circumstances we're looking at here then the circumstances the Court was looking at in Graham.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.412" offset="6455871">Exhibit A on that front is the fact that out of the 39 States or jurisdictions that allow this--</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.001" offset="6486173">sentence, as Mr. Stevens has indicated -- or Mr. Stevenson has indicated, a good chunk of them, 27 in all, make the sentence the minimum sentence under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.456" offset="6523998">That's an important fact both because it tells us a little bit about the retributive goals that the legislatures were trying to achieve through these statutes, but it also--</text>

            <text syncTime="1980.184" offset="8026875">Nonetheless, I certainly agree that there are fundamental differences between certain kinds of murders, and I think that judgment is reflected in the legislation we have in at least 27 of these States, where aggravated murder in the very least carries with it a life without parole sentence for any defendant regardless of the mitigating circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2767.888" offset="11177765">Surely the legislatures understood that when they were transferring persons who committed crimes like aggravated murder that were well within the heartland of the crimes for which the transfer statutes were intended, those offenders would be subject to the minimum sentences at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.398" offset="11239727">It's quite another thing to say, well, the legislature might have enacted a statute providing for transfer for a 14-year-old; and for a non-homicide crime, they might have assumed that the person would get less than the maximum in terms of life without parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.872" offset="11285703">But surely the legislators understood that those offenders would at least get the minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.076" offset="11302526">And the reason the line is more safely drawn at 13 or 12, it's because if you look at, for example, the tables from the Department of Justice reports that both sides and the amici have cited listing the transfer ages, by and large, the number seems to be cut off at 12 or so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.452" offset="11368041">And 12 would be on the very bottom of the range; and if I were a defense attorney, I would be arguing much harder for a line at 13 than 12.</text>

            <text syncTime="2974.756" offset="12005219">Justice Scalia, I haven't seen any studies that would suggest that juveniles do better, particularly when they are subjected to the sorts of crimes that I think everyone would have -- or the sorts of offenses, let me say, that I think everyone would agree the Constitution would have to permit a sentence of say 40 years minimum or the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.635" offset="12072720">So I just don't think -- I think society -- society's primary goal here or the Government's primary goal here is expressing the retributive judgment about the wrongfulness of murder and why it's different from, not homicide, but I think governments are quite legitimate and quite reasonable when they also say that they don't want to roll the dice on convicted murderers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.362" offset="12147639">Society acts with particular revulsion when a convicted murderer commits a crime again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.333" offset="12167492">And even if -- and even if that difference in terms of recidivism is no different, or even if the possibility for recidivism is no different, the fact that the person committed a murder once and might commit a murder again is reason enough for legislatures to be hesitant to allow for parole in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.276" offset="12231335">With respect to the penological purposes, there's also an important purpose here with respect to the unique factors and the unique circumstances that murder victims and their families face.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.683" offset="12280864">I think a lot of people hear about life-without-parole sentences, and if they impose them on political grounds or policy-based grounds, one of their sort of pragmatic responses is, well, what's the cost to all this?</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.577" offset="12332482">Why not just let these guys get their parole hearings, give them that hope, and likely they won't get parole anyway?</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.914" offset="12357873">And there's really no cost to society at least in allowing that process to occur, but the cost is to the victims and their families who have to endure what are often very painful hearings and parole hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.205" offset="12406983">And when those come up on a frequent basis, that sort of re-traumatization process is something that governments can legitimately take into account when they decide that for aggravated murder -- not for other crimes but for aggravated murder -- that a life-without-parole sentence is an appropriate sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.100" offset="12474588">On the moral culpability point, there would be some anomalies created by the rule that Miller is seeking here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.037" offset="12506353">Miller's asking the Court to effectively hold him in the same place in terms of his moral culpability as the defendant in Graham.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.976" offset="12542088">In other words, Graham can only get life -- life with parole because of his reduced moral culpability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.211" offset="12562986">And Miller is saying he should only get life without parole because of his reduced culpability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.348" offset="12583571">So that would mean one of two things: either the Eighth Amendment would put a murderer on the same moral level as someone who committed a non-homicide crime as in Graham; or Graham himself would be back in this Court or a court of another jurisdiction arguing that because Graham held that Graham himself had categorically less culpability than someone like Miller, then Graham himself is entitled to a lesser punishment than the one that Miller, in fact, received.</text>

            <text syncTime="3292.845" offset="13277592">I just want to make clear that the rule we seek would not require States to impose the same sentence on juveniles convicted of homicides from juveniles convicted of non-homicides.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.053" offset="13322418">The States would be free to do that if they chose to, but they could certainly create a regime where it's life with parole where there are different ages for eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.390" offset="13351779">In fact, the State of Nevada makes you eligible for parole after 15 years if the crime is a non-homicide, 20 years if it's a homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.663" offset="13384798">The States would still have a great deal of flexibility to create, consistent with this Court's rule, a regime that makes these distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.499" offset="13412175">Justice Kennedy, I did want to point -- direct your attention to two amicus briefs that I think respond to two of the questions you've raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.320" offset="13435476">There is an amicus brief submitted by criminologists in this case, and it looks specifically at the question of deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.374" offset="13455642">And what they've found is life without parole has not had any measurable deterrent effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.261" offset="13475182">The States that don't put juveniles -- don't subject children to life without parole have actually experienced the same level of decrease in violent crime and homicide as the States that do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.384" offset="13515724">And in fact, in some of those jurisdictions, the decrease is even more significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.086" offset="13530562">I also want to address your question, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.954" offset="13537980">There is -- there are some studies that have established that juveniles are more likely or less likely to recidivate after an intervention than adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.143" offset="13574761">Generally speaking, homicide offenders are categorically less likely to recidivate than many non-homicide offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.732" offset="13605063">Drug offenders and property crime offenders are much more likely to recidivate than -- than homicide offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.384" offset="13627737">And so there's a lot to support that a judgment rooted in these penological concerns would be well-supported here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.473" offset="13656054">I also want to return, Justice Breyer, to your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.775" offset="13669324">Mr. Neiman has -- argued that we can read into these statutes a commitment to imposing life without parole at a particular age, and that age is the age of transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.031" offset="13706313">I just want to highlight that the two States with the largest populations of juveniles serving life without parole by a huge margin are Pennsylvania and Michigan, neither of which has a minimum age.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.687" offset="13752916">That means in those States, a child of any age can be subject to a mandatory sentence of life without parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.157" offset="13774859">It's simply not true -- true that we can read into those statutes in those jurisdictions any kind of conscious commitment to thinking about age.</text>
