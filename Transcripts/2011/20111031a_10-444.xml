            <text syncTime="201.497" offset="910378">Under the State court decision, the defendant has the option of either pleading guilty to the charge -- in which case he will be right back where he is now -- or he can insist on a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.239" offset="961369">If he insists on the trial, you need to prove that he was driving with a revoked license.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.676" offset="991148">That seems to me -- if there ever was a slam dunk trial, that seems to me that's the slam dunk trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.580" offset="1014763">You introduce the records of -- showing that his license was revoked, and you have the officer testify that on such and such a date, he was driving.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.920" offset="1052066">So I -- I don't really see what is involved in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="295.541" offset="1286541">But in this case also, the defendant went out 2 days later and picked up a fifth charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.628" offset="1310887">So one of the considerations that I think has to be left with the Court is that the possibility that this particular defendant was ever going to see this plea offer is almost nil.</text>

            <text syncTime="1132.666" offset="4635021">In this case the alleged deficiency is really not an interaction between the prosecution and the defense counsel in plea bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.138" offset="4664905">The alleged deficiency is a failure to inform the defendant of things the defendant would want to know as going forward, and we're -- we are willing to assume the defendant has a right to be properly informed by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.613" offset="4710881">But with any Strickland claim the relevant inquiry is whether or not the defendant has shown cognizable prejudice as a result of a deficient performance by the counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.636" offset="4746930">And when a defendant pleads guilty in open court, the conviction rests on the defendant's assertion, an admission of his own guilt, and his consent that there be judgment entered, a judgment of conviction, entered without trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.026" offset="4796458">And because the conviction rests on a consent judgment, it wipes free antecedent constitutional errors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1327.141" offset="5412948">And the reason that that is a relevant inquiry is because you have a constitutional right to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.445" offset="5430188">And due process requires that the waiver of those trial rights be knowing, intelligent and voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.332" offset="5453699">And in Hill, the Court confronted the question and said: You need to show deficient advice in the context of pleading guilty; and in addition, you had need to show that that prejudiced you because, absent -- if you had received proper advice, you would have actually not waived your right to trial; you would have asserted your right to trial and gone to trial.</text>

            <label>Mr. Chris Koster</label>

            <text syncTime="3222.107" offset="12992846">Two of the justices questions raise the concept of sentencing equivalency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.745" offset="13011341">And certainly sentencing equivalency is an important goal, both at the federal system and we've tried at the state system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.565" offset="13034642">But sentencing equivalency is not an avenue that the Sixth Amendment is intending to reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.903" offset="13064004">The essential question here to Justice Breyer's earlier question that I think I didn't answer properly, is should we begin unwinding these convictions in search of lost plea opportunities?</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.393" offset="13113950">I think that we should not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.362" offset="13121891">It undermines the long discussions in both Hill and Premo about the importance of the finality of these, and our being able to rely on the finality of these decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.786" offset="13167553">There is mutual reliance, there's state reliance as well, because when these offers are made the state does not interview witnesses, the state does not send evidence to the lab, the state does not, you know -- sometimes even get to the point where the charges are made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.713" offset="13223246">So there is state reliance, which is synonymous with a reliance of justice on the finality of these agreements as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.068" offset="13260654">And also, the search for these lost opportunities that Mr. Frye is asking this court to lead us towards, takes a point of representation beyond the limited scope of the Sixth Amendment in Gonzalez v -- Gonzalez-Lopez and other courts, the limited -- the limitation of the Sixth Amendment that this Court has always appropriately articulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.917" offset="13352082">For this and other reasons stated in our briefing, the Missouri versus Court of Appeals should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.237" offset="13377369">Thank you.</text>
