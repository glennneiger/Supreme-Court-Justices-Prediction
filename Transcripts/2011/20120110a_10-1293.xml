            <text syncTime="10.422" offset="146035">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.741" offset="155335">In its previous decision in this case, the Court observed that when a broadcast licensee takes a license for the free and exclusive use of a valuable part of the public domain, it also accepts enforceable public obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.200" offset="221163">One of those enforceable obligations is the indecency restriction which Congress has instructed the Federal Communications Commission to enforce between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.--</text>
            <text syncTime="41.508" offset="270378">Respondents in this case have for years benefited enormously from their free and exclusive use of public spectrum.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.712" offset="303292">They argue, however, that neither Congress nor the commission may as a condition of their licenses require that they refrain from broadcasting indecent material when children are most likely to be in the audience.</text>

            <text syncTime="64.138" offset="360970">But, General Verrilli, it seems to me that this contract notion of yours can only go so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.690" offset="379152">I mean, if the idea is just, we gave them something, now they have to do whatever we say, you wouldn't accept that.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.544" offset="406528">So the question is why is this condition appropriate when many other conditions would not be appropriate?</text>

            <text syncTime="88.603" offset="458773">This condition is appropriate, Justice Kagan, because it has been a defining feature of the broadcast medium from its inception in the 1920s in the Radio Act and has continued to be a defining feature of this medium throughout its history.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.748" offset="531393">And the argument that my friends on the other side are making here is that that norm, that legally enforceable norm which has been recognized by this Court in Pacifica and has been applied since the inception of this medium, needs to be overturned now because circumstances have changed.</text>

            <text syncTime="137.400" offset="653960">That's certainly true, Justice Scalia, and I will certainly get to vagueness, if I -- if I may continue along this line.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.921" offset="676112">Their argument is that circumstances have fundamentally changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.875" offset="695860">I want to point out at the outset something I think is significant, which is that their argument would sweep away indecency restriction with respect to radio as well as television, and they would sweep that away in the arguments they are making today without making any showing that circumstances have changed at all with respect to the ubiquity of -- or accessibility of radio.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.490" offset="790319">And I think if one looks at the FCC orders that this Court cited in its prior decision in this case, one would see that a lot of the most vile and lewd material really is in radio.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.064" offset="840683">So I just want to put that marker down at the beginning here because I do think it is quite important.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.529" offset="938486">And the Respondents are arguing in this case that Pacifica ought to be overruled because the circumstances that justified its rule no longer obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.654" offset="979028">I want to put a marker in at the outset here with respect to radio because I do think it's quite important, that they haven't made any argument that those circumstances are any different with respect to radio.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.177" offset="1017062">It's just as ubiquitous as it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.877" offset="1023854">There isn't even any argument that there is blocking technology available.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.580" offset="1038691">I want to make sure, given the kind of vile material that the record demonstrates has been transmitted over time on radio, that the Court focuses on the breadth of the argument that the Respondents are making here.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.471" offset="1090309">Now, with respect to television, I do think they are making an argument that -- that television broadcasting is no longer uniquely pervasive in the way that it was before.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.548" offset="1142554">They are not making an argument -- but that, if I may, is a very different kind of argument than one would normally get in support of a -- the suggestion that we ought to depart from stare decisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.872" offset="1191873">They are not -- they are not arguing that broadcast television is any less pervasive than it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.342" offset="1213816">If anything, it is probably more pervasive now.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.559" offset="1222593">They are not arguing that the harms of that pervasiveness no longer exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.613" offset="1242864">What they are arguing is that there is other media that present harms as well, and that with respect -- and that because those other media also present harms, the circumstances require a change in the rule with respect to broadcasters.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.173" offset="1297095">Now that -- you can I think look at that in one of two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.541" offset="1310574">You could say either that's an argument that it's futile to continue to impose this restriction on broadcasters, and I think that's what Fox says at page 33 of its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.531" offset="1354564">Two points in response to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.532" offset="1362505">I think a significant if not complete answer was in this Court's prior decision in this case in which it said that the maintenance of a safe haven is actually particularly important in -- in the context of these changes, a broadcast safe haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.042" offset="1416526">And also I do think that the idea of futility in that nature is foreign to our First Amendment jurisprudence.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="335.546" offset="1446619">General Verrilli, I took it from the briefs and what the FCC has been doing that the major objection is that one cannot tell what's indecent and what isn't; that it's FCC, the censor, that's saying NYPD Blue&gt; ["] is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.481" offset="1562290">And I do think that that is the major objection, that we have a -- a government agency that is going to make decisions about when nudity is okay and when it isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.241" offset="1621326">You can't do it in terms of time because the NYPD&gt; ["] was 7 seconds and another broadcast, Catch-22&gt; ["], was 40 seconds.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.149" offset="1677019">So it's -- it's the appearance of arbitrariness about how the FCC is defining indecency in concrete situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.472" offset="1726234">That I think is the nature of the--</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="407.924" offset="1736056">Let me turn to that, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.376" offset="1745878">The -- two points about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.395" offset="1757999">The first one is that as we read this Court's recent decision in Humanitarian Law Project, the question on the Fifth Amendment analysis of whether there is vagueness and arbitrary enforcement has to be answered by reference to the specific broadcasts at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.624" offset="1830933">In other words, was there fair notice with respect to these specific broadcasts?</text>
            <text syncTime="435.259" offset="1845457">And I will get to that, but I -- but let me first go directly to Your Honor's more significant question.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.645" offset="1866982">And I think the -- the problem with looking at the case that way is that the lens is focused too narrowly, in that there actually, when one broadens out the lens and looks at the wide range of decisions that the commission is making about indecency and then broadens it out even further and looks at the wide range of broadcasts that occur, actually the number of broadcasts are -- that have been identified as even raising a question of arbitrariness or inconsistency is a -- is really quite a miniscule fraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.386" offset="2005953">It's even quite a miniscule fraction even with respect to broadcasts that the commission has adjudicated as indecent or not indecent.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.989" offset="2032389">And yes, we would concede that there is not perfect clarity in this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.443" offset="2050152">It's a context-based rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.276" offset="2057467">As we read Pacifica, the Court suggested in Pacifica that the context-based rule may well be what the Constitution requires here, and that's going to result in some -- something less than absolute precision.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.222" offset="2117235">But the -- of course, the alternative, I would assume from my friend's perspective, would be worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.057" offset="2140641">The commission could have a list that said: Never say the following however many words, never show broadcasting between the hours of 6:00 a.m. -- nudity between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.--</text>
            <text syncTime="520.431" offset="2186094">That would be clearer, but it would -- but in a way the commission here, I think by following the context-based approach that I think Pacifica suggested was required, is being -- "punished" is too strong a word, but it's being held against it that it's trying to make reasonable accommodations for First Amendment values.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.745" offset="2263416">And so I think when one looks at it both in terms of where the lenses actually ought to be focused here and the fact that the -- the alternative perfect clarity would reach a less effective accommodation of First Amendment values, then I do think that the commission's position is quite reasonable and sensible.</text>

            <text syncTime="564.876" offset="2363935">When it was here last time, we were dealing with an issue called fleeting expletives and that was Fox.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.816" offset="2395700">And the Fox case involved just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.434" offset="2410120">They didn't really, or we didn't, or the Court didn't, attack the 2001 order which is now at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.690" offset="2439168">And then without it going back to the commission, the Second Circuit decided it on a ground that sets aside the 2001 order.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.546" offset="2474590">Now, can we here just decide the fleeting expletive case, because the fleeting expletive case has to do with one subset of applications of the 2001 order and has to do with part 2.2 or something.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.872" offset="2531850">I mean, it has -- and how you interpret the words "material dwells on or repeats".</text>

            <text syncTime="621.279" offset="2589529">And it raises the question of the validity of, under vagueness grounds, of 2001 industry guidance and how that's been applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.737" offset="2627354">But the Second Circuit didn't deal with that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.689" offset="2639161">It sent it back to the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.822" offset="2647730">So has there been a commission decision recently which has reviewed the basic arguments being made here about the validity of the 2001 industry guidance as applied?</text>
            <text syncTime="650.314" offset="2705617">Has there been such a thing?</text>
            <text syncTime="652.066" offset="2712618">Alternatively, has there been an appeals court holding on the analysis of the ABC case?</text>

            <text syncTime="779.183" offset="3221170">In fairness, I do think that if one reads the commission's disposition of the ABC case, it is applying the 2001 guidance reaching the conclusion that the broadcast was indecent under the 2001 guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.559" offset="3286580">ABC paid the fine that it was assessed, and then, as it has -- as it can do, then invoked the Hobbs Act and went to the court of appeals to challenge it.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.516" offset="3334437">And so I do think -- I do actually think that the issues have been considered by the agency and are before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.772" offset="3363485">And I do agree with Your Honor, moving I think more directly to the vagueness point, that there really isn't a vagueness issue left with respect to the fleeting expletives in the Fox case, because the Court said the last time the case was here that there is no problem of arbitrary punishment because there was no forfeiture or any other sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.638" offset="3458988">ABC is in a different position because they were sanctioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.040" offset="3476543">And so there is an issue with respect to the question of whether the commission's indecency standards can constitutionally be applied here and whether they are too vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.981" offset="3516353">But I do think, and I would like to spend a minute on that question of whether there is vagueness as applied to the ABC broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.170" offset="3553029">Now, the commission's standards in the 2001 guidance say that this is essentially a two-part test.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.357" offset="3581868">First is a subject matter question: Is there a description or depiction of sexual or excretory activities or organs?</text>
            <text syncTime="879.282" offset="3621575">And then there is the question of whether the depiction or description is patently offensive under community standards for broadcast informed by three factors: Whether the expression is explicit; whether the broadcast dwells on it; and whether it's shocking or pandering or titillating.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.126" offset="3700882">Now, ABC makes an argument with respect to this broadcast that the nudity in the NYPD Blue&gt; ["] episode is outside of the first subject matter criteria because it didn't have fair notice that buttocks would be considered sexual organs for purposes of application of this -- of this standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.442" offset="3786146">The commission said, and this is at page 137a of the appendix to the petition, that it's impossible to believe that they didn't think that the naked display of buttocks would bring them within -- that they didn't have fair notice that the naked display of buttocks would bring them within this rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3358.542" offset="13538597">Even if it wants to leave it as factors -- and this is number 3 -- it could at least identify what they are, and apply them consistency -- consistently through adjudication that explains why one over-balances the other, which it certainly did not do in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3395.984" offset="13688330">First with respect to the notion of self restraint on the part of broadcasters, I think a little history is in order here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.606" offset="13726783">The commission started with the rule that came out of Pacifica.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.744" offset="13747367">What it faced in the 1980's, with that being the outer bound of the commission's authority, was the explosion of the shock jock phenomenon, Howard Stern and Bubba the Love Sponge and the rest of it which didn't use any of the seven words in the Carlin monologue, but which was highly vile and lewd, and it required the commission to make a judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3441.529" offset="13870561">General, I think that the, the networks really are saying: Well, even if some regulation is permissible, the kind of regulation that the FCC has done here is regulation that gives it complete discretion as to what kind of speech to go after and what not to go after; that it has not tied itself in any way to any kinds of standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.744" offset="13967423">And, it's, you know, evident in the notion that this -- the way that this policy seems to work, it's like nobody can use dirty words or nudity except for Steven Spielberg and that there's a lot of room here for FCC enforcement on the basis of what speech they think is kind of nice and proper and good.</text>

            <text syncTime="3515.511" offset="14166476">Second, I do think if one looks at the corpus of decisions that the commission has made about what is indecent and what isn't, I think one can see with respect to the large majority of them, the vast majority of them that it is clear which side of the line something fell on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.485" offset="14218303">Yes, there is isn't perfect clarity, there are going to be some hard cases, but they really have identified where is, in the great scheme of things, a trivial number of hard cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.675" offset="14251112">I don't think one can say that this is a situation like in Reno which there is effectively no standard at all.</text>
