            <text syncTime="62.221" offset="353238">Most of the time that influence, the defense will allege, is from some police activity, and rightly so because they are mostly involved and rightly so because police suspicion is the kind of influence that would direct the witness's attention and say that's the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.266" offset="425441">But it's not necessarily required, and in fact one of the Federal court of appeal cases, Dunnigan v.

            <text syncTime="117.708" offset="575279">So shouldn't we look at every instance of evidence introduced in criminal cases to see if it was reliable or not?</text>

            <text syncTime="127.932" offset="616135">I suggest that eyewitness identification evidence is unique, and I think that this Court recognized that in Wade and in the subsequent cases, in fact described it at that time as probably the leading cause of miscarriages of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.025" offset="676530">And in fact experience with the DNA exonerations that we've seen recently in the last 10 or 15 years have shown that.</text>

            <text syncTime="158.535" offset="738492">No, Your Honor, and I don't think that's exactly what the Court said in Wade and the subsequent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.939" offset="760121">It's the combination of eyewitness identification testimony plus the suggestive influence which makes -- which brings it to sort of the height of suspicion and creates the greatest risk.</text>

            <text syncTime="212.936" offset="956144">Now, if we had been able to have our due process claim heard, the judge may or may not have agreed that that was suggestive and created a risk.</text>

            <text syncTime="2081.356" offset="8429777">And if we looked at reliability further as sort of the touchstone of our due process inquiry, we would need to misplace completely the role of examining whether the suggestive circumstances are unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.014" offset="8484425">An -- an inquiry into necessity only makes sense in the context of a police investigation or police work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.354" offset="8517862">And if we look at Stovall, certainly there is an example of a case that was a show-up, where this Court said that, despite the clearly suggestive circumstances, that show-up was imperative and necessary because the witness may have been about to die.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.113" offset="8580869">The Court did not conduct a reliability analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2656.425" offset="10730120">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.079" offset="10744748">A due process inquiry is required only when there is a police-arranged confrontation in order to obtain an identification and then the police unnecessarily suggest that a certain suspect is guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.702" offset="10787171">And that's because, as the State has said, the Court's central concern in these cases is the State putting a thumb on the scales, gaining an unfair advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.625" offset="10818936">Just as, as Justice Scalia said, the State can't create a false document and introduce it at trial, it can't manipulate someone's memory and then use that evidence to prove guilt at trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2688.146" offset="10856970">So do you mean to say, Miss Saharsky, that there can never be a due process violation from the admission of unreliable evidence?</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.466" offset="10890303">Assuming that the State has not created that evidence, has not produced that evidence, but the State knows that the evidence is unreliable or has a very substantial chance of being so, that that can never be a due process violation?</text>

            <text syncTime="2710.457" offset="10946205">I'm saying that's where the Court's cases are now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.491" offset="10954355">The State can't knowingly introduce perjured testimony, but you're not talking about perjured, knowingly perjured testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.045" offset="10976611">If the question is just unreliable, the Court has said on numerous occasions -- it's rejected claims like that and said: The Constitution doesn't protect to ensure all evidence is reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.651" offset="11014959">It provides a process by which the court can test reliability through cross-examination, confrontation, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.055" offset="11036588">The Court has -- And that was in Crawford.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.841" offset="11043798">The Court has also said -- if I can just add one more thing -- in the due process context, that where the check comes in is in Jackson v. Virginia, that the verdict has to have enough evidence to be supported each element of the crime beyond a reasonable that a rational jury could find it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.415" offset="11098028">So that is a due process check.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.681" offset="11103148">But where the Court's cases stand today, the Court has not found, so far as we can tell, a case where it said that the mere introduction of unreliable evidence would isolate the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.603" offset="11142855">And every time it's been confronted with a claim like that, in Dowling, for example, in Colorado v. Connelly, the Court has rejected such a claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="2768.542" offset="11178590">The extreme example is where an identification has been produced by torture, but the torture has been through a non-State actor.</text>

            <text syncTime="2776.296" offset="11209624">That is an extreme example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.212" offset="11217251">There are many reasons why, A, the prosecution would never introduce that kind of evidence to begin with, and B, that there would be other checks on the process in addition to the confrontation and cross-examination types of things that we talked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.937" offset="11264167">There would be a check on the process through Brady and Giglio, for example, that if the government knew that those were the circumstances of the identification, they would have to turn that evidence over to the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.875" offset="11303873">There would also be checks in terms of the trial process if the government actually put on evidence like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.296" offset="11325607">So it is -- it is very unlikely that such a thing would happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.648" offset="11335011">We are not saying that the Court has to hold in this case that due process could never play a role there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.885" offset="11355909">But what we are saying here is this is very routine, run-of-the-mill evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.271" offset="11369493">Someone who saw what happened and wants to come into court and tell the jury that, and as Justice Kennedy noted, you know, what Petitioner is asking for here is to take all of those away from the jury, really usurping the jury function and having these mini trials where the court itself is trying to decide reliability.</text>

            <text syncTime="2910.132" offset="11744925">It said: No, reliability is up to the jury, and it uses the State rules of evidence, and this court's not going to be a rule-making organ for rules of procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="3171.613" offset="12790868">Let me give you another example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.813" offset="12795674">Let's say you have -- the State puts on a witness who -- who says this person did it because I saw it in my crystal ball.</text>

            <text syncTime="3181.018" offset="12828484">And I think that the answer that I would give is the same one to the question Justice Kagan asked, which is where the Court is now, the Court has never that the introduction of some kind of evidence is so unreliable it'd violate due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3195.495" offset="12886371">--What I'm saying is the Court doesn't need to address that question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.530" offset="12898492">It also doesn't need to foreclose it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.930" offset="12904135">But this is very run-of-the-mill evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.582" offset="12910717">But it doesn't mean that the Court could never find that some kind of evidence is so problematic that the Due Process Clause could preclude its admission, but what we're talking about here is fairly run-of-the-mill evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.755" offset="12947393">I would just point the Court to the decision in Dowling which was about a prior conviction for which the person had been acquitted; and then that evidence was let in at his trial, and he said that's a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.127" offset="12988876">That evidence is too unreliable and too prejudicial, and the Court said that's not for the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.681" offset="13007161">The Constitution gives you the process to test evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.383" offset="13017924">It doesn't ensure that all of the evidence that's going be introduced be reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.918" offset="13032030">And that's what Petitioner is saying here today, and that would be a very expansive view of the Due Process Clause that just can't be reconciled with cases like Dowling and Colorado v. Connelly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.207" offset="13069228">If the Court has no further questions we'd submit that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3252.849" offset="13115831">I will try to make three points in those 2 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.867" offset="13127847">I would ask the Court to consider the circumstances that would be excluded if the Court accepts the rule proposed by the State, that there has to be some intentional manipulation or intentional orchestration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.591" offset="13178734">Suppose that rather than the accidental or happenstance show-up we had here, suppose that the accident was in the line-up at the police station, and the police were completely in good faith, getting to the mental state issue, but in spite of their good faith there was suggestion in the line-up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.386" offset="13249891">Would the trial court look at that and say even though this was a suggestive line-up we are not going to consider a due process claim because it wasn't intentional or deliberate manipulation?</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.778" offset="13291478">We would suggest that that would be contrary to the principle that the primary evil is the risk of misidentification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.431" offset="13314152">Consider another circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.281" offset="13321571">Suppose there are two witnesses at the police station, and in spite of the best efforts and good rules of the police, witness one looks at the line-up and then -- or looks at the photo line-up so that they can't be changed, let's say, and leaves the line-up and somehow communicates to witness two, I picked the one on the bottom at the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.345" offset="13397744">I think that's the one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.311" offset="13401610">That suggestion would be very powerful from the person who experienced the very same crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="3339.020" offset="13460438">The problem is that the witnesses who have -- are under the suggestive influence actually believed what they are testifying to, and the -- that's why the Court said in Wade cross-examination for this one kind of evidence -- not floodgates, but this one kind of evidence, cross-examination may not always be enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.518" offset="13538492">The witness's sincerity has a powerful effect on the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.636" offset="13550926">The last point I want to make is this is not going to open the floodgates, as we say, or create a slew of new claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.742" offset="13587393">Under the Watkins case this Court knows that there -- there is not even required to have a separate hearing on this evidence, and the reason a separate hearing isn't required is because these issues would be fleshed out in front of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.633" offset="13634936">This is only a question of what legal standard applies when the judge hears the defendant's objection that this violates due process, there is a -- there is a substantial likelihood of misidentification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.791" offset="13687599">So it's not any new claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.976" offset="13696272">It's not any separate hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.011" offset="13704422">It's simply a question of what exactly is the due process rule.</text>
