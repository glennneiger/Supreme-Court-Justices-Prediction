            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">I -- I was going to read a bit of the dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.751" offset="124385">Justice Kagan and I do dissent and for the most part, our dissent concerns an issue that normally wouldn't warrant my saying anything from the bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.305" offset="158657">And I think Justice Alito correctly stated the issue in this case that union that represents nonmembers in collective bargaining can, in certain States, charge those members a fee for the representation, but the First Amendment says they can't charge an objecting nonmember for certain political expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.901" offset="240995">So, given that constitutional interpretation, how, in the context of a special midyear assessment, is the union supposed to calculate what's the proper discount to give the objecting nonmember for the political part of what the union is collecting.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.052" offset="305674">Now, that's an administrative question, and it's not easy to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.495" offset="323438">I know how we answer it normally where a yearly fee is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.594" offset="339843">Well, that so, an accounting firm usually goes over the books for Year One, and they figure out -- the union figures out on the basis of the audited accounts, what was the political part, what was the nonpolitical part, and it then collects the political, nonpolitical ratio, whatever that was, for Year Two based upon Year One's accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.696" offset="420195">What happens if it changes during Year Two?</text>
            <text syncTime="81.522" offset="431480">Well, then, that shows up in Year Three because they used Year Two for Years Three and it all works out more or less, not perfectly but more or less.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.344" offset="466798">For example, if 30% of Year One's for union's expenses are political, the union in Year Two can charge the objecting nonmembers only 70% of the basic fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.262" offset="514445">But if Year Two's political expenses turned out to be higher, say 40%, then the union can charge the objecting nonmembers in Year Three only 60% and so, it sort of works out.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.422" offset="563137">And Justice Kagan and I think that the same system used for the yearly expenditures should be applied when the union levies a special charge in the middle of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.318" offset="602739">It's workable.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.907" offset="609008">The majority doesn't think this, okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.499" offset="619457">So far, what we have looks like an ordinary disagreement in an ordinary case, but there is one thing about the majority's opinion that, in our view, is not ordinary and Justice Sotomayor, joined by Justice Ginsburg, agree with us on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.051" offset="685599">The majority says that in -- where you have a special midyear charge, no objecting nonmember has to pay any of the special charge unless he or she opts-in, i.e., affirmatively he says he wants to.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.697" offset="752159">Okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.592" offset="755816">Now, we are very concerned about that part of the opinion, which, in technical jargon, goes, “You have to opt-in or opt-out.”</text>
            <text syncTime="169.905" offset="785074">For one thing, it seems to me that in such a case, the objecting nonmember, unless they affirmatively agree, wouldn't even have to pay a share of the union's purely collective bargaining expenses, say, suddenly arising union cost to hire experts to help it bargain about pensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.888" offset="876920">Prior cases make clear that the nonmembers' First Amendment rights cover the union's political expenses, but not this kind of ordinary collective bargaining expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.015" offset="921433">For another thing, the question is to whether objectives are -- was it the opt-in, they're free not to pay, unless they say they want to, unless they opt-in or they have to pay unless they opt-out, that's the opt-in versus opt-out, that that's a very important issue in the minds of many unions, in the minds of many employees and in the minds of many employers as well as others.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.579" offset="1019758">How should the law treat the nonmember employee who is basically indifferent?</text>
            <text syncTime="234.009" offset="1041492">It isn't carried just to who would like to pay it less.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.217" offset="1050269">He's indifferent to the union's political expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.471" offset="1063330">For 50 years, this Court has consistently found constitutional a system that requires the nonmember to opt-out.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.274" offset="1094468">You have to care, in other words and they've said that was constitutional in all kinds of different context that, to us, should be the same today, but today the Court takes a different path.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.195" offset="1142220">Further, this kind of question has been entwined with words you will recognize, with right to work issues and related issues which approved highly controversial politically.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.076" offset="1189763">The Court is answering, at least in this limited special assessment context, matters about which many unions, employees and employers have strong but different views, and it is a matter that different States have resolved differently as a matter of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.923" offset="1253083">By holding that the Constitution itself answers the question, the Court has wrongly, in our opinion, prevented States from choosing among a variety of different possible answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.076" offset="1297701">Finally, the Court has decided this matter, we think, without adequate briefing.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.385" offset="1318912">The opt-in versus the opt-out question was not addressed by the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.499" offset="1335421">It was not presented to this Court for review in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.897" offset="1349005">The parties did not brief the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.431" offset="1359141">So, in our view, at a minimum, the Court should not have decided the question without further briefing.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.781" offset="1380561">Justice Kagan and I also believe that in any event because of the some of the administrative concerns that the majority identify, we also, the two of us, believe the Court came up with a wrong answer.</text>
