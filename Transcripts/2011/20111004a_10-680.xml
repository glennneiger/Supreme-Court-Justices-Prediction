            <text syncTime="11.891" offset="150967">The first is whether the right against self-incrimination requires that a prisoner always be Mirandized before being interviewed in isolation about conduct that occurred outside the prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.547" offset="197569">The second is an AEDPA question, whether this Court in Mathis clearly established such a per se rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.953" offset="223169">For three reasons, the answers to both questions is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.837" offset="238738">First, for nearly 50 years this Court has declined to adopt any new per se rule that always requires a Miranda warning, instead considering all the circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="162.052" offset="751574">There are a number of circumstances that kind of culminate in what I consider to be the two most important.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.837" offset="766725">Remember the background circumstances: He was in a room that was not locked.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.191" offset="780100">It was a conference room, not an interrogation room with a bright light.</text>

            <text syncTime="173.843" offset="798699">He was not threatened.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.012" offset="803401">He was not physically harmed in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.661" offset="809984">The two big ones are: One, that when he started to become belligerent, the guards told him that: If you don't want to cooperate, then you will have to go back to your cell; you will have to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.819" offset="850631">And that is the exact opposite of Miranda custody, where--</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="189.771" offset="862438">As I see the record, he claims twice he said: I don't want to talk to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.673" offset="882082">And when he asked to leave at the end, it took 20 minutes, and they continued the questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.745" offset="910399">Doesn't that counter the rest of what you are saying?</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="205.714" offset="926177">--There are two factors that go into the mix, and I will discuss each one in turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.416" offset="941014">When he says, I don't want to talk any more, then he went on and kept talking.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.737" offset="958360">You have to consider, well, why does he keep talking?</text>
            <text syncTime="215.887" offset="966928">Well, the record shows, I think a fair reading of it anyway, that he was trying to explain to the officers this timeline he keeps talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.575" offset="993677">At the end, when it was a 20-minute delay, there is no contention that that was anyhow inconsistent with reasonable prison procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.096" offset="1023770">And the fact that it could have been 20 minutes, it could have been 30 seconds, it could have been an hour, depending on procedures, demonstrates why a per se rule doesn't make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.868" offset="1058879">We should look at all the circumstances.</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="264.919" offset="1163055">That is a little bit different.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.385" offset="1168906">But the key facts here are, one, at the beginning, the questioning officers say: You're free to stop this and go back to your cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.525" offset="1197432">Then in the middle, he gets belligerent, and they say: If you don't want to cooperate, you have to leave, you have to go back to your cell, which is, I submit, the opposite of Miranda custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.214" offset="1232227">And then when he finally invokes his right to go back to his cell, it is immediately honored, with of course the 20-minute delay due to prison procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.635" offset="1261902">And so from beginning to end, a reasonable person in his position could have believed they were free to return.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.722" offset="1286248">And that is all that Miranda requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.574" offset="1293667">In fact, we have a trial court finding on that, on three of them: One, that he was told he was free to go; second, that he understood he was free to go; and third, that he was free to go, and that's all--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="309.381" offset="1340897">And it doesn't make any difference that they took him from his cell, he was under compulsion to leave with them and interrogated during the hours when prisoners are ordinarily sleeping?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="326.993" stopTime="374.557">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="326.993" offset="1411323">--Again, I would submit those are all circumstances that should go into this "all the circumstances" consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.349" offset="1444760">You know, there were also other things that militated in favor of the trial court findings, such as the explicit instruction that he was free to leave; that he would have to go back if he didn't cooperate; that they did honor his request to leave, once made.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.339" offset="1496691">So these are all the things that the Court should look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.441" offset="1505155">And you can imagine the number of other situations, maybe with facts different than these, where a per se rule would be wholly inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.195" offset="1532113">You know, what if they had invited him to come down and he had the choice at the beginning?</text>
            <text syncTime="361.416" offset="1549040">What if someone was stationed outside the door and took him immediately as soon as he said: I'm ready to go back.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.801" offset="1570565">It just demonstrates that this isn't the place for a per se rule; that we should just follow the same Miranda test that has been applied for 50 years, and that's all the circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="374.557" offset="1601599">General, when you say that, I took sometimes your brief and the U.S. Government's brief to be saying something more, which is that it's not all the circumstances; it's all the circumstances minus circumstances that are attendant upon normal prison living.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.918" offset="1667009">So are you still arguing that, or are you really arguing an all-the-circumstances test?</text>

            <text syncTime="400.041" offset="1703581">And the analogy that I would draw is just like in the J.D.B. case last term, that you would consider not only the age of the suspect, but also the school environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.062" offset="1735659">So I'm not saying the prison environment is taken out of the equation, just that it's not dispositive in and of itself, just like this Court held in Shatzer.</text>

            <text syncTime="427.359" offset="1812773">That's still something that the court can consider along with everything else.</text>

            <text syncTime="434.029" offset="1839522">And, you know, one of the benefits of having a per se -- I'm sorry -- of having an all-the-circumstances rule, rather than a per se rule, is that it encourages truthful, voluntary confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.836" offset="1886751">And this Court has repeatedly recognized that such confessions are an unmitigated social good.</text>

            <text syncTime="587.696" offset="2454131">And here they were saying just the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.596" offset="2461759">And the message they sent was sent was consistent with the instructions they gave him at the beginning: If you tell us you want to leave, we will honor that request, and consistent with what actually happened at the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.670" offset="2498017">He said, I want to go back, and they honored that request.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.420" offset="2509093">And I think one of the other factors that you put in the mix here is that we were dealing with outside officers, not inside prison officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.442" offset="2537096">These outside officers did not have the ability to impact his day-to-day prison life the way someone inside the prison would.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.530" offset="2565517">Now, one other point I want to make about in and out of prison is this artificial line that the Sixth Circuit drew to cabin its per se rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.719" offset="2602297">They said that if the conduct takes place outside the prison per se you get Miranda; if the conduct that they are questioning talking about was inside the prison walls, we are not going to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.677" offset="2642108">And the Sixth Circuit was forced to make that policy decision because otherwise prison administration becomes very difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.397" offset="2664991">But under this Court's precedent and under the Fifth Amendment itself, there is nothing that would suggest that there should be a distinction in the Miranda analysis as to the locus of the conduct that is being questioned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.619" offset="2709817">And it's possible to have a very serious in-prison crime, a murder of another inmate, and a very nominal outside crime, petty theft, and yet the Sixth Circuit would give pure Miranda protection to that petty theft questioning and no protection at all to the person who murdered someone inside the prison walls.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.667" offset="2782020">And that just demonstrates where the Sixth Circuit rule starts to fall apart.</text>

            <text syncTime="770.277" offset="3184515">It's true they didn't ask him if he wanted to go, but there is also no contention that he resisted going and they made him go anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="790.958" offset="3267166">Second, when he got belligerent they said: If you don't want to cooperate, you will go back to your cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.578" offset="3285661">And third, when he asked to go back to his cell that request is honored within the context of the typical prison administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.499" offset="3313351">And it's very possible that in his everyday prison life he could be taken over next door for a medical exam, he could be taken over next door for a visitor if that was county policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.187" offset="3348146">But there is nothing inherent about the walk into the next building that means per se he has to be Mirandized.</text>

            <text syncTime="840.457" offset="3465174">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="845.760" offset="3486386">The Sixth Circuit has imposed a per se role that whenever a prison inmate is isolated for questioning about conduct that occurred outside the prison, that inmate is in custody for Miranda purposes, regardless of the circumstances of the interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.768" offset="3538422">But in the prison context, as in any other, the traditional Miranda custody tests should apply and the question should be whether, in light of all of the circumstances, a reasonable person in the suspect's position would have felt free to terminate the interview and leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.895" offset="3590980">That is so for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.562" offset="3597667">The first is that the Court reaffirmed in Maryland v. Shatzer that restraints on a suspect's freedom of movement are a necessary but not sufficient condition for Miranda custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.384" offset="3632880">In other words, a reasonable suspect whose freedom of movement is restrained may nonetheless feel that he is free to terminate the questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.106" offset="3659839">Second, there are in fact many situations in which a reasonable inmate isolated for questioning would feel free to terminate the interrogation despite being subject to background prison restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.812" offset="3698604">And third, the Sixth Circuit's per se rule here requires Miranda warnings to be given in situations in which the concerns about custodial interrogation that drove Miranda are simply not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.037" offset="3743535">That holding impairs the important truth-seeking function of investigations by requiring the suppression of voluntary confessions made in noncustodial situations.</text>

            <label>Ms. Ginger D.  Anders</label>
            <text syncTime="1003.627" offset="4117922">The difference is that the person who is on the street, their baseline is that they have complete free will, they have freedom of movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.866" offset="4150836">But when you look at the prison situation, the ultimate question is whether the reasonable inmate would feel free to terminate the questioning and one situation you look to in determining are the physical restraints on that person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.824" offset="4194617">And when you look at the restraints you have to take into account the fact that the prisoner has a baseline, which is that he has some restrictions on his movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.078" offset="4223666">That's what the Court said in Shatzer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.680" offset="4230144">So when you look at the totality of the circumstances, you consider the restraints and the prisoner's baseline, but you also consider everything else that happens during the questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.952" offset="4267133">So there could be many situations in which the questioning will go in a manner that tells the reasonable inmate that he is free to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.289" offset="4292524">For instance, the most clear example is when someone is actually told that they can leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.241" offset="4308302">But there could be many other examples as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="1056.145" offset="4327946">Putting aside what the Sixth Circuit did here, if you look back at the initial State Court opinion, do you read the State court -- do you think the State court is fairly read, could the Sixth Circuit have fairly read it, as establishing its own per se rule, which was the per se rule that we rejected in Mathis?</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.040" offset="4403493">In other words, that the State supreme court required some kind of nexus between the prison custody and the interrogation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ginger_d__anders" startTime="1084.396" stopTime="1223.555">
            <label>Ms. Ginger D.  Anders</label>
            <text syncTime="1084.396" offset="4441004">I think the State court opinions are somewhat unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.449" offset="4457200">There some statements that could be taken to be inconsistent with Mathis, but immediately after those statements the state Court said: Well, it's not enough alone for custody that someone is incarcerated on a conviction that's unrelated to their questioning; and we look to the fact that the inmate was told that he was free to leave and he actually felt free to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.111" offset="4535777">So I think the best reading of the State court's opinions is that they did go through the totality of the circumstances and they did conclude that the Respondent reasonably felt that he was free to leave in this interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.486" offset="4581334">But more importantly, I think the Sixth Circuit went much further than that and established a per se rule that says, no matter what the questioners do, no matter what a prisoner is told -- told, no matter how free he feels to leave, that person always has to be Mirandized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.211" offset="4632221">And that extends Miranda way beyond its initial concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.597" offset="4649775">Voluntary confessions, this Court has recognized, are an unmitigated good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.501" offset="4669419">So any time someone confesses voluntarily in a noncustodial situation, the Sixth Circuit's rule applied to prisons would say that that person's confession would has to be suppressed, even though it was given in a situation that doesn't implicate Miranda's concerns at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.327" offset="4728665">I think the Sixth Circuit's rule really arose from two assumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.065" offset="4751653">One was that isolation alone is sufficient to create custody in all circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.552" offset="4773595">And that can't be the case, because we know that an inmate can be told that he can leave, he can be given an initial choice before he comes along for questioning, he can be interrogated in isolation purely because he is waiting to be treated in an infirmary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.959" offset="4827199">There are any number of situations, I think, where an inmate could be isolated for questioning, but he would still feel free to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.463" offset="4853217">Going to Justice Sotomayor's question about whether someone in prison necessarily feels coerced, I think that the Court in Shatzer established that background restrictions incident to being incarcerated are not in themselves sufficient to create Miranda custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.992" offset="4919359">So in other words, they don't create such a huge coercive impact that nobody would feel free to terminate questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.079" offset="4943705">So I think accepting the proposition that someone in prison is always coerced would lead to a per se rule that says, no matter how non-accusatorial, no matter how non-coercive that situation is, that person would always be in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.886" offset="4994905">So--</text>

            <text syncTime="1234.261" offset="5040462">Someone's picked off the street and told, you have to go into this room, and questions are asked.</text>

            <text syncTime="1250.122" offset="5103888">And so we know that restraints alone -- the restraints of prison aren't enough alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.357" offset="5124786">And so when you consider the restraints -- when you consider the -- the fact that a prisoner is told he has to go into a room, you would look not only to that fact, but you'd also look to everything that happens in the questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.565" offset="5165641">But then when you go back to consider the fact that the prisoner was told that he has to come to the room, you would -- you would look to whether it's a normal prison policy that prisoners always have to be escorted places, and so that would help the Court determine whether--</text>

            <text syncTime="1298.969" offset="5299284">So certainly what happens in the questioning can lead a reasonable prisoner to believe that he is free to go, even though he has been told he has to go to the questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.975" offset="5331257">So if he is told he can leave, if it becomes clear from experience, if there's a prison policy saying that inmates can always leave, if he sees that he can summon the guards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.581" offset="5365739">All of those circumstances have to be taken into account in addition to the fact that he was told initially that he has to go with the guard.</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="3065.279" offset="12364466">I think the hypotheticals today demonstrate how quickly the logic of the Sixth Circuit's new per se rule falls apart when you test it with other facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.917" offset="12406993">Even in the Sixth Circuit's view, you would already would make exceptions to that new per se rule if it was in-prison conduct or if it was prison guards as opposed to outside guards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.109" offset="12443773">In response to questions today, Mr. Fields' counsel admits that there must be an exception if you have a button that you can press to get out, like in Mr. Ellison's situation, the First Circuit case that Justice Souter wrote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.498" offset="12489331">She admitted that if you are in a circle of proximity, or not in a circle of proximity, that that would make a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.669" offset="12514095">No per se rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.421" offset="12517021">And that if the situation isn't confrontational, that you need to have an exception for that, or if the prisoner initiates questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.408" offset="12545024">And you can imagine many other hypotheticals that would similarly create exceptions to what is supposedly a per se rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.744" offset="12570311">And -- and ultimately what this comes down to is Justice Alito's question: If he is under no pressure at all, the prisoner welcomes the questioning, and I would submit that a fair reading of the record here shows exactly that, that even then it would be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.819" offset="12622660">And that is a particularly strange rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.821" offset="12630706">But what we are talking about is not a constitutionally mandated protection but a prophylaxis, something that is supposed to protect a constitutional right, and where the protection isn't necessary, nor there should be a per se rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.162" offset="12680025">Counsel concedes that there isn't anything in Mathis that clearly establishes the rule that the Sixth Circuit applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.832" offset="12710745">Maybe it's an extension, maybe it's implied -- I think it's difficult to find either one of those -- but at a bare minimum, this requires reversal under the AEDPA standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.037" offset="12743555">I do want to emphasize that the Sixth Circuit's per se test does have societal cause; it impedes prison administration and eliminates potential for voluntary truthful confessions that we all want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.764" offset="12798412">Finally, the test that we advocate for is not our own per se test, that simply saying you're free to leave is not the be-all, end-all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.218" offset="12832266">Because it's possible that officers could say you are free to leave while doing something else nonverbally that indicates you are not free to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.624" offset="12861837">That's why a totality of circumstances test makes the most sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.009" offset="12875421">We urge you to go past the AEDPA question and actually rule on the merits, because we think that would be good guidance for the lower courts and for law enforcement officials, and the test that we would propose is that a Miranda warning is not required when a reasonable person in the prisoner's position would have felt free to go back to his cell in accordance with ordinary reasonable prison procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.855" offset="12962774">That is exactly what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.441" offset="12969148">We respectfully request that you reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.824" offset="12978657">Unless there are further questions, I will cede my time.</text>
