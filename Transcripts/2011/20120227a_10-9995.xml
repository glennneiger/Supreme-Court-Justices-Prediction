            <text syncTime="24.448" offset="202247">It did this even though the State had done three things that should have precluded this result: First, the State deliberately relinquished a known statute of limitations defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.672" offset="251148">Second, in doing so the State acted strategically, not inadvertently.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.343" offset="277898">And third, in doing so the State induced the district court to expend substantial resources in deciding claims of exhaustion and deciding claims on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="69.493" offset="382492">And in your reply brief you appear to say, yes, they do in some circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="200.858" offset="907971">If it's a waiver then Day makes clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.877" offset="919987">So it's a question of which box this case fits into, is it forfeiture or is it waiver.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.323" offset="1093754">We don't sit here to decide whether when the government says, you know, we do not concede it but we are not arguing it, or whatever the language was, we don't sit to decide factual questions like that that come up in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.118" offset="1160941">I thought we took this case to decide the more significant issue, on which there is a division in the lower courts, as to whether there is, as you say, power of the court to disregard the fact that the statute of limitations defense has not been raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.179" offset="1241189">You all agree it wasn't raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.964" offset="1248399">Now, whether it was forfeited or not is another question.</text>

            <text syncTime="579.539" offset="2422655">We've always said, and in fact the State has never disputed, that that was a properly filed motion, and the only issue was whether it was tolled -- whether it tolled the statute of limitations period until 2004.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.768" offset="2495589">And the State realized that that issue -- if they were to prevail on the timeliness issue, it was a very, very difficult issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="627.805" offset="2615752">When Mr. Wood was pro se, he filled out pro se motions, and in those pro se motions he did say that there -- and I'm talking about the 2004 motions -- he said there was no prior post-conviction motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.131" offset="2681058">And I believe he was confused because if you look at the forms, both the Federal forms and the State forms that show what a -- a defendant should check, it makes it sound like a motion has to have been ruled on; and Mr. Wood was pro se and simply confused.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.711" offset="2759321">And no one else was confused once the State entered their appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.282" offset="2781578">They knew that the 1995 motion was still pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.667" offset="2799132">All they had to do was sit at a computer and bring up the minute orders from the State, and they could learn that.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.922" offset="2828180">So the courts in making their rulings always from the time -- and, you know, one of the reasons why what happened was so strategic, and so clear, is that the district court had initially dismissed Mr. Wood's petition as untimely.</text>

            <text syncTime="704.955" offset="2924311">As I understand the opposing argument, it goes sort of like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.574" offset="2942805">It says: In Day we said it's fine to do this in the district court; even if the party hasn't raised it, the court can raise it on this exact issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.731" offset="2983452">In Granberry we said with respect to a different issue that the appellate court could raise it; and in Day we said that those two issues were really the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.670" offset="3023158">So that seems sort of like a logical argument that just gets you to a place where you lose on the first question, unless perhaps there is a difference between a court raising a question sua sponte and a court allowing a party to raise it later than the party ought to have raised it.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.401" offset="3106123">Are you relying on that distinction, or are you questioning the logic of the basic argument that Granberry and Day decided this?</text>

            <text syncTime="760.791" offset="3147710">And with respect to the first argument about there being a difference between a party presenting an issue and a court sua sponte raising the issue, there is a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.266" offset="3193581">And the courts, the circuit courts do not always make that distinction and do not always focus on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.253" offset="3221480">For example in Granberry it actually was a case where the party presented -- the State presented on appeal the exhaustion issue, and the court agreed to hear it even though the State hadn't raised it below.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.013" offset="3276546">Here, you know, at least five times in our joint appendix you'll see the court saying that they can't act as an advocate for the Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.320" offset="3325760">And in fact when the Petitioner, Mr. Wood, tried to raise an -- the exhaustion issue again, the Tenth Circuit in its certificate of appealability said he is bound by his decision to dismiss these unexhausted claims, notwithstanding his pro se status.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.365" offset="3397963">And in the same breath, the court of appeals resurrected the at least concededly forfeited statute of limitations defense on behalf of the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="853.784" offset="3519589">That that -- that the court of appeals has more power after a party who has forfeited below or waived below now tries to come up on appeal and assert a defense that they didn't assert below?</text>

            <text syncTime="926.782" offset="3811638">And in Granberry, of course, as the Court all knows, the Court was dealing with exhaustion, and it was dealing with exhaustion, which goes to the heart of habeas and comity and all those concerns, at a time when dismissing a case to exhaust claims, all that would do is delay Federal relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1152.712" offset="4715370">And if that had happened, the court very well could have, district court, could have appointed counsel for Mr. Wood -- I mean, if there had been an evidentiary hearing, if, as the Tenth Circuit found, the issue was so complex that counsel was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.458" offset="4798335">So once you had counsel, in the State's reply or in its answer they indicated that several of Mr. Wood's claims were not exhausted, and some of those claims were in that 1995 motion that was pending.</text>

            <text syncTime="1345.170" offset="5485147">Because if they had -- if they had challenged timeliness, they would have raised this very complicated issue, because the only way they can win on timeliness is to win on this newfangled notion of abandonment under Colorado law, which under Colorado law requires a hearing and requires factual development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.918" offset="5572187">And once they pursued in the district court that claim of abandonment, it was very likely that a lawyer would be appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.225" offset="5613356">That lawyer could see that there were claims still pending in the 1995 motion, and could possibly have sought a stay and abey; could have gone and tried to exhaust those claims, serious constitutional claims that were in the 1995 motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.068" offset="5676781">And maybe a better way of putting it is if they had raised timeliness in the district court, abandonment would have been front and center.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.933" offset="5776255">And even though the court of appeals ultimately resolved this issue without an evidentiary hearing, that was an abuse of discretion itself, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.206" offset="5805303">It was totally contrary to Colorado law, analyzing that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.193" offset="5825261">It is no small thing that the position that they took in the district court allowed Mr. Wood to go forward on two claims, two constitutional claims that are substantial that the Court has granted a certificate of appealability on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.725" offset="5923377">This is -- this case is so unlike Day, in the sense -- if an appellate court can raise sua sponte the statute of limitations in a case like this, it can raise it in any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.251" offset="5985548">It invites the State to take a position in the district court which would be totally contrary to AEDPA's desire for streamlined proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2958.020" offset="11936556">I think the procedural default cases are another good example this Court in Day cited, a number of them, a number of them of which were cases in which the court of appeals was raising the issue sua sponte.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.728" offset="11979396">On page 12 of our brief, we cite a number of procedural default cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.097" offset="11992876">A lot of them come up in the sua sponte context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.466" offset="12002384">And the courts of appeals have not made a distinction between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.834" offset="12015863">I think they certainly implicate different concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.453" offset="12026312">For example, to the extent this Court has been worried about sandbagging or strategic behavior, I think that's largely absent in circumstances where the Court is raising on its own motions as opposed to the party belatedly raising the issue on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.713" offset="12087334">So I do think if you look at Granberry, you look at Day, you look at Gaspari, you look at Schiro, and you look at the procedural default cases, I think that really does resolve the first question presented.</text>

            <text syncTime="3025.315" offset="12205721">And if the court of appeals had not issued a certificate of appealability on the issue of timeliness, would the issue have come up at all?</text>

            <text syncTime="3043.876" offset="12280013">But when the court of appeals did ask for briefing on this issue in the certificate of appealability process, the State, of course, did have an opportunity to respond there, and it did argue that the petition was untimely, and it strongly argued that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.803" offset="12335707">And so, I guess, turning to the second question presented of deliberate waiver, I don't think there has been a deliberate waiver in the way that Day spoke about that term here for two primary reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.261" offset="12381578">Number one when Day spoke of deliberate waiver, it spoke of overriding a State's deliberate waiver, and I think if you look, when the court of appeals decided the timeliness question, there is no way to look at that as the State -- as the court, rather actually overriding the State's deliberate waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.305" offset="12449705">At that point the State had argued that the petition was untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.424" offset="12462244">Petitioner never argued that the court shouldn't decide the issue, never argued that that -- that the State had waived that issue below.</text>

            <text syncTime="3131.334" offset="12629845">There is a big difference between, if that's the background of Day where the lawyer didn't know there was a statute of limitations defense; and this one was the lawyer knew very well there was and decided to tell the district court not to -- not to deal with that issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3632.893" offset="14636049">But the fact is, you look at the nature of the waiver, or -- the right being waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.881" offset="14656007">And this Court recognized in Hill v. New York and other cases that if the right being waived -- for example, the right to be tried in a timely fashion under IAB, it can be waived just by a lawyer accepting a date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.771" offset="14707625">And the statute of limitations issue here is a typical strategic decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.342" offset="14733852">And when AEDPA brought this in, it didn't bring it in as it brought in comity.</text>
