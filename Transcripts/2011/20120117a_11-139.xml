            <text syncTime="130.468" offset="631390">It's true that, like the 1939 code, it includes the phrase</text>

            <text syncTime="142.193" offset="678306">Well, if they use the exact same phrase, and it's a fairly detailed -- it's not just a normal phrase they might use elsewhere -- I think it's reasonable to assume that that phrase came in with the baggage it carried from the Colony case; right?</text>

            <text syncTime="166.308" offset="774750">And so, I would take your point that if Congress had enacted the same language after this Court's decision in Colony, then the adjacent statutory provisions that we're relying on would be pretty indirect means of expressing an intent to change the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.901" offset="837130">But what Congress was reacting to in 1954 was not this Court's Colony decision; it was reacting to a circuit conflict and trying to resolve that conflict.</text>

            <text syncTime="200.112" offset="909960">And if, as you acknowledge, it's a pretty obscure way to change the law from what we said it was, the law that's written there, that's a very obscure way to change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.503" offset="955517">I'm inclined to think that the law stays the way it was.</text>

            <text syncTime="229.381" offset="1026988">It's at page la of the red brief, the appendix to the Respondents' brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="256.901" offset="1137121">And it's important to recognize that for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code generally the term "gross income" is defined to include gains derived from dealings in property.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.349" offset="1550900">But Congress was acting in 1954, before the Court's decision in Colony, and it was reacting to a circuit conflict.</text>

            <text syncTime="759.839" offset="3148863">I thought the basis is that there are two kinds of things: One is you just don't put in some big category of stuff in your return, and the agency can never figure that one out.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.928" offset="3189196">And the other is where you don't state your deductions correctly.</text>

            <text syncTime="796.479" offset="3295462">What's really bothering me about this case, and I can't quite figure out the answer to this, is it seems to me when they filed that tax return in April of 2000 it was a terrible loophole, but these lawyers have the job of creating loopholes or at least trying to take advantage of them, okay?</text>
            <text syncTime="816.409" offset="3375188">And the IRS had told them this was okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.378" offset="3383024">Indeed, they had informal advice to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.646" offset="3396086">Now there's a -- you don't put the date of the year 2000 reg and I don't know if you are both talking about the same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1388.997" offset="5665499">One, he said that the IRS had given people advice that Son of BOSS was okay, it would work, this tax shelter, this tax scheme would work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.488" offset="5715446">And then he said -- he suggested that a basis is like deductions, and you agree that overstatement of deductions don't get you the longer statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.849" offset="5780961">So why -- why should an inflated basis get you to 6 years when inflated deductions don't?</text>

            <text syncTime="1430.791" offset="5832683">And the other question is, is it so that agents told people that Son of BOSS would work?</text>

            <text syncTime="1437.763" offset="5860582">No, it's not true that the IRS had advised people that Son of BOSS transactions were okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.965" offset="5877405">It wasn't until 2000 that the IRS issued a specific document that said as a matter of agency policy they are not okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.369" offset="5906975">But again, that document was just a kind of case-specific application of the more general proposition, of the more general proposition that transactions lacking economic substance can be disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.509" offset="5951592">With respect to why the overstatement of basis is treated differently from the overstated deduction, that follows inexorably from the language of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.650" offset="5996105">That is, Congress defined the conduct that would trigger the general rule as an omission from gross income, and because of the way that gross income is defined an overstatement of basis can lead to an understatement of gain, which in turn is taken into account in computing gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.046" offset="6077712">A deduction may ultimately affect taxable income, but it doesn't affect gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.682" offset="6100281">And so there would be no way of reading the statute to encompass that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.234" offset="6114492">Now as to why Congress would have done this, I think a clue is furnished by subparagraph Roman (ii) which is at the bottom of page la, and it says:</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.692" offset="6160259">"In determining the amount omitted from gross income, there shall not be taken into account any amount which is omitted from gross income stated in the return if such amount is disclosed in the return or in a statement attached to the return in a manner adequate to apprise the Secretary of the nature and amount of such item. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.118" offset="6225983">And so that provides a safe harbor that says even if you fall within the general rule, even if you understated your gross income by more than 25 percent, if at some point in the return you gave the IRS adequate information to notice that the misstatement had taken place, you will be off the hook for the secure assessment period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.781" offset="6308634">And I think that is highly relevant in responding to the policy concern that Justice Harlan identified in Colony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.452" offset="6335279">That is, Justice Harlan said: The reason we think that Congress intended to restrict the statute to situations where an item is left off the return altogether is that those would be the most difficult for the IRS to catch; the IRS would be placed at a special disadvantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.664" offset="6404138">Here in subparagraph (ii), Congress has accomplished the same intent, but through a different mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.218" offset="6426394">That is, it's made the general rule sweep more broadly, but given taxpayers an out where the disclosures are adequate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2108.393" offset="8543044">In 1982 Congress re-enacted the same language, 26 U.S.C. 6229, which is the provision for partnerships, and yet it omitted the subparagraph (i) that the government relies upon as the transformative provision narrowing the general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.907" offset="8637189">And so why on earth would Congress omit that subparagraph if it did the transformative work that the government suggests?</text>

            <text syncTime="2147.018" offset="8697584">I think the answer is, is subparagraph (i) just doesn't have and was never intended to have the transformative effect that the government suggests.</text>

            <text syncTime="3412.421" offset="13759175">I'd like to make three quick points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.907" offset="13765130">First, Mr. Garre refers to the amended heading of section -- subsection 6501(e), which now states (e) refer to amounts and some to items.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.250" offset="13830541">Subsection (e)(2), which deals with estate and gift taxes, refers to omission of items.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.837" offset="13852902">And the legislative history makes clear that Congress chose that term precisely to make clear that the understatement -- or the overstatement or understatement of an item that was reported will not give rise to the extended period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.913" offset="13905147">The second thing is that at autumn, Respondents argue that the phrase -- the phrase "amount of gross income" should be construed to mean item -- of gross receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.436" offset="13947256">And they don't offer any real textual argument as to why that would be a sound reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.173" offset="13966169">Really, they rely exclusively on Colony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.458" offset="13975364">But the Court in Colony said at the beginning of its opinion that it was pronouncing only on the 1939 code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.827" offset="13996784">It said at the end of its opinion that it was not generally trying to construe the 1954 code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.064" offset="14017787">And it stated that the relevant -- most relevant language was not unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.099" offset="14033878">And I think the recognition of ambiguity is relevant in part because it sets up our Brand X argument, but it's also relevant because saying that a particular snippet of language is unambiguous is to recognize that its meaning may vary depending on context.</text>

            <text syncTime="3528.247" offset="14222482">And then the third point I would want to make is that Mr. Garre referred to cases, and one IRS General Counsel opinion that were issued during the period between 1958 and 2000 that applied Colony to the current statute, but they did so in a very specific way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.856" offset="14284967">That is, they relied on the aspects of Colony that talked about Congress's purpose to reserve the extended assessment period for cases in which the IRS was at a special disadvantage due to inadequate disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.080" offset="14333868">And those cases applied that language in elucidating current subparagraph (ii), which provides a safe harbor in cases of adequate disclosure.</text>
