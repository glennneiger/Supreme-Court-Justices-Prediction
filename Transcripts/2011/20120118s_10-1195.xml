            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">The third case I have to announce is Number 10-1195, Marcus Mims v. Arrow Financial Services.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.010" offset="152409">Consumer complaints about abuses of telephone technology, for example, computerized calls to private homes, prompted Congress to pass the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, which I will call TCPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.474" offset="222312">The Act bans a number of invasive telemarketing practices and directs the Federal Communications Commission to prescribe implementing regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.606" offset="262855">States may sue to enforce the Act on behalf of the State's residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.677" offset="283126">When a State does so, Congress has instructed, jurisdiction lies exclusively in the U.S. district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.379" offset="321891">The Act also permits individuals to seek redress for violations of the Act or regulations in an appropriate court of a State, if otherwise permitted by the State's laws or rules of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.298" offset="385630">Petitioner Marcus Mims filed suit in Federal District Court alleging that respondent, Arrow Financial Services, a debt collection agency, violated the TCPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.249" offset="437352">Arrow did so, Mims said, by repeatedly using an automatic telephone dialing system or prerecorded or artificial voice to call his cellular phone without his consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.056" offset="492628">The District Court affirmed, the Eleventh Circuit dismissed the complaint for want of subject-matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.513" offset="522407">According to those courts, the TCPA, although it expressly provides that federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over TCPA actions brought by State Attorneys General vest jurisdiction over private actions exclusively in state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.318" offset="601715">We reverse and hold that -- that the TCPA does not deprive U.S. district courts of the federal-question jurisdiction they possess under 28 U.S.C. Section 1331.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.229" offset="653333">Congress granted federal courts general federal-question jurisdiction in 1875.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.041" offset="676530">Except for eliminating the amount in controversy requirement, the statute has remained essentially unchanged since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.074" offset="708712">Section 1331 provides that U.S. district courts have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.195" offset="761166">Mims' TCPA claim plainly arises under the laws of the United States as federal law creates the right of action and provides the rules of decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.774" offset="807455">Therefore, the District Court had jurisdiction over Mims' complaint unless the TCPA expressly or by fair implication excludes federal court adjudication of suits by private persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.536" offset="866492">Arrows' argument did not persuade us that Congress eliminated 1331 jurisdiction over private TCPA actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.868" offset="903899">Although the language of the TCPA is uniquely state-court oriented, the grant of jurisdiction to one court does not, of itself, imply that the jurisdiction is to be exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.640" offset="958966">Nothing in the text, structure or purpose or legislative history of the TCPA purports to deprive U.S. district courts of a jurisdiction they ordinarily have under 28 U.S.C. Section 1331.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.746" offset="1019361">We, therefore, apply the familiar default rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.936" offset="1032108">Federal courts have 1331 jurisdiction over claims that arise under federal law and because federal law gives rise to the claim for relief, Mims stated and specifies the substantive rules of decision, the court below erred in dismissing Mims' case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.746" offset="1119357">We, therefore, reverse the Eleventh Circuit's judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.600" offset="1146838">Our decision is unanimous.</text>
