            <text syncTime="1611.181" offset="6549170">What's important is that in a 13 case, unlike a 12 or an 11, you have a very short period of administration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1621.903" offset="6592010">And it's very unlikely that April 15th is going to fall within that short period of time and that's when the government says that your taxes are incurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.559" offset="6622626">So you're going to have a -- it's unlikely you're going to have an administrative expense claim for your income taxes during the period of administration of a Chapter 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.998" offset="6656376">It's a very short period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.465" offset="6662228">So the government has the option not only during the administration period, but also during the whole period of the plan, to elect to say: All right, there have been some big commissions earned here and I want to go ahead and collect from the estate rather than just wait and see what the debtor earns afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.977" offset="6732340">And so it then can go ahead and file a claim and ask to have that claim paid out of the bankruptcy estate, and it really gives the government much broader rights than it does in a normal Chapter 11 or a Chapter 12 case or a 7.</text>

            <text syncTime="1683.777" offset="6839547">The postpetition income tax liability at issue in this case is not subject to section 1222(a)(2) and thus cannot be treated as a dischargeable nonpriority debt for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.585" offset="6886776">First, consistent with the structure of Chapter 12, a Chapter 12 plan is limited to prepetition debts and does not cover postpetition debts, including administrative expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.892" offset="6927945">Rather, postpetition administrative expenses are paid separately through section 1226(b)(1), which contains no farm sale exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.998" offset="6964412">Because section 1222(a)(2)(A) strips priority only from a subset of claims covered by a Chapter 12 plan and does not alter which debts fall within that plan, it cannot apply to the postpetition tax liability at issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1759.361" offset="7141836">Does that make sense, though, in terms of if you are talking about farmers and fishermen and you are talking about the treatment of their central asset, whether it's the farm or typically the boat, and they either want to try -- they want to try to save the farm or the boat, and they go into bankruptcy and the big issue is how that asset's going to be treated and your position is it's not in the bankruptcy at all, it's outside of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1786.361" offset="7249878">Well, Your Honor, two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.961" offset="7256252">One, as a practical matter Chapter 12 is a reorganization provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.663" offset="7271090">It's not a provision just designed to allow farmers to get out of the business of farming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.531" offset="7290525">So often what will happen is that the farmers will try to reorganize some of their farm sale assets, sell some of their livestock, change their farming operation, to see if they can save it outside of bankruptcy first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.375" offset="7341934">All of those sales -- an example of that is the Knudsen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.827" offset="7355726">Knudsen is the only circuit case to go Petitioner's way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.160" offset="7365026">In Knudsen it not only involved the postpetition tax liability of the type at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.231" offset="7389372">It also had a significant prepetition tax liability component in that case based upon just what I was explaining, the farmer trying to reorganize, trying to change the farming operation to save the farm without having to go into bankruptcy.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1834.156" offset="7440990">Yes, but also I gather it's a fairly typical situation where you have farmers that might want to sell part of the farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.310" offset="7469620">You know, they have dairy and corn operations or something, and they sell one to try to preserve the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.631" offset="7490936">And that's -- that's exactly the sort of thing that should be considered in the bankruptcy context, and yet your position says we're going to treat it outside the bankruptcy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1855.154" offset="7525000">Well, Your Honor, it certainly happens within the bankruptcy, and I'm not disputing your point that that may -- that may arise in a bankruptcy case just like it arises in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.343" offset="7561780">And it will be dealt through the bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.795" offset="7571602">That is, the sale will happen and it will be approved by the Bankruptcy Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1890.077" offset="7664703">How the tax liability would be dealt with under the government's view is at the time the debtor moves to sell the farm asset during the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.349" offset="7701797">Like in this case, that sale of the farm asset generated $960,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.901" offset="7719978">That was the sale price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.767" offset="7723426">The capital gain tax liability in this case is $29,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.538" offset="7738577">If they would have set aside from that $960,000 sale price $29,000 to pay the capital gains tax debt, that would resolve the issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1920.178" offset="7785075">But there's every reason to think, Mr. Shah, that what Congress was worried about here was cases in which the bankruptcy plan would not be approved at all because there were very high capital gains taxes that would result from a sale; and that that was the problem that everybody was focused on, was making sure that farmers could take advantage of section 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.407" offset="7866055">So it's a little bit odd -- it's actually more than a little bit odd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.259" offset="7877444">It's a lot odd to read the statutes to apply not in that context, but only as to people who have somehow managed to sell their property, you know, 18 months before going into bankruptcy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1955.000" offset="7924360">Your Honor, when you say that everybody was focused on this problem, we have the evidence of exactly one person as to what one legislator thought that this bill would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.236" offset="7957379">That's Senator Grassley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.938" offset="7960200">Now, admittedly, Senator Grassley's statements do indicate an intent on his part to reach postpetition taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.092" offset="7984755">But the preexisting statutory framework does not permit that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.627" offset="8002936">What section 1222(a)(2)(A) does is it allows the debtor to strip priority from a certain subset of governmental claims, such as prepetition taxes, and there is no doubt that Senator Grassley correctly understood that's how section 1222(a)(2)--</text>

            <text syncTime="2003.230" offset="8117352">Not only would it -- would it mean that postpetition capital gains on the sale of part of the farm or the entire farm would be outside of the bankruptcy, outside of the bankruptcy, but all of the prepetition capital gains would be outside of it too, unless they occurred in a previous taxable year.</text>

            <text syncTime="2025.177" offset="8205124">First of all, I don't think it's sort of a null set or a vanishingly small set.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.429" offset="8218081">There is the Knudsen case which qualifies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.564" offset="8226649">In the professors' amicus brief, on page 10a of their amicus brief, they provide a chart of representative cases involving postpetition tax liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.819" offset="8259668">They cite eight cases in their chart on page 10a.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.569" offset="8270639">Three of those eight cases involve significant prepetition tax liabilities, even under the narrower definition of "prepetition".</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.175" offset="8297075">But -- but to get to your larger point, even to the extent it might be narrower than what Congress intended, Congress certainly knew how section 1222 operated in the sense that it would strip priority from certain claims that are already entitled to priority under a Chapter 12 plan, such as prepetition taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.553" offset="8374606">And both sides agree that that's how section 1220(a)(2)(A) works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.974" offset="8396340">There is no dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.024" offset="8400520">The dispute is about whether this postpetition tax liability comes within the Chapter 12 plan in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.912" offset="8436046">That dispute turns on preexisting code provisions, part of the 1978 Act, part of the 1980 Act and the 1986 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.918" offset="8468020">Whatever deference Senator Grassley is owed as to the operation of section 1220(a)(2)(A) itself, he is owed no deference whatsoever as to the proper interpretation of those preexisting code provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.393" offset="8513996">It's our position that these preexisting -- preexisting code provisions, section 503(b), section 9 -- 346 and section 1398 and 1399, all lead to the result that postpetition tax liabilities are not an administrative expense within the meaning of the code.</text>

            <text syncTime="2532.229" offset="10233271">Section 346 in the 1978 act codified those rules for State and local income taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2639.212" offset="10661261">What this Court held in Holywell, which both sides cite and both sides agree, is that when a corporate trustee has a duty to file a return under 6012(b)(3), it also has a duty to pay the tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="2655.257" offset="10725418">So there are two ways to incur the tax: One is separate taxable entity; the other way is if the code imposes an obligation on the bankruptcy estate to -- to file and pay the tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.462" offset="10766273">That's the other way to interpret it, and that's why all the Chapter 7 and 11 corporate cases that are cited by Petitioners are inapt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.135" offset="10800964">In those cases the postpetition tax liabilities are, in fact, incurred by the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.770" offset="10815488">What is remarkable is that Petitioners do not cite a single Chapter 12 case in which a postpetition tax liability has been treated as an administrative expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.392" offset="10858015">Chapter 12 has been around since 1986, and yet there is not -- if this was such a big problem that Congress was trying to get at it through this way, you would have expected at least a single case in which a postpetition tax liability had been treated as an administrative expense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3165.386" offset="12765895">We know that they made the same assumption in the Chapter 12 case because 1, they enacted the same separate taxable entity rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="3185.013" offset="12844471">Now in practice, it's been the case that bankruptcy courts have extended that time beyond the statutory deadlines.</text>

            <text syncTime="3263.512" offset="13158463">"those will be paid before or at the time of each payment to creditors under the plan. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.214" offset="13173300">If you also said that they come under 1222(a)(2), which is the only way that Petitioner's could win -- if they also came under 1222(a)(2), 1222(a)(2) says that their -- they must be provided for full payment in deferred cash payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.140" offset="13240905">So deferred interest-free payments over the life of a 3 to 5-year bankruptcy plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.794" offset="13259609">That's very different than having them get superpriority treatment under 1226(b)(1) and be paid in front -- upfront separate from the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.734" offset="13295344">So that -- that is one significant piece of textual evidence that Congress thought that these should be paid outside of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.987" offset="13324392">The other piece of textual evidence is section 1227(a), which appears on page 10A as well, and what it says is that</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.945" offset="13364203">"the confirmed plan shall be binding on each creditor. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.480" offset="13374339">That is the only potentially relevant category to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.099" offset="13388758">But section 101 defines creditor -- and this is on page 1A of our appendix -- as entity that has a claim against a debtor that arose at the time of or before the order for relief concerning the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.490" offset="13438391">That is a holder of a prepetition claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.942" offset="13448213">If a confirmed Chapter 12 plan is only binding on the holder of a prepetition claim, it makes no sense to include postpetition claims within a Chapter 12 plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.166" offset="13493039">I don't even know what it would mean to have a confirmed -- to have a plan included that and not have that plan binding on the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.503" offset="13526371">And so I think if you take those two pieces of textual evidence together, I think that strongly supports the interpretation of 1222(a)(2), that when it says a claim of the type specified in section 507, it means "claim", and doesn't mean "claim and administrative expense".</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.132" offset="13596902">Now admittedly, Congress has not been perfectly clear in using that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.186" offset="13613098">It uses -- sometimes it uses of the term "claim" to mean claim and administrative expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.054" offset="13632637">Sometimes it means it to only mean claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.422" offset="13642041">But we should give effect to the distinction between claim and administrative expense in light of 1226(b)(1), which specifically already addresses administrative expenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="3427.784" offset="13815495">Because we know that administrative expenses have to be paid in some way in a bankruptcy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.736" offset="13831377">But 1226(b)(1) does exist in this code, and we need to give that provision effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.157" offset="13856977">The last point I would make is Congress knows how to include administrative expenses within a bankruptcy plan when it wants to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.830" offset="13887697">If you look at the corresponding provision in Chapter 11 as opposed to the provisions in Chapter 12 and 13 -- this is section Section 1129(a)(9)(A) -- it expressly provides for the payment of administrative expenses within the context of the Chapter 11 plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.475" offset="13958332">Chapter 12 and 13 take a different approach, and the Court should give effect to the choice that Congress made to treat administrative expenses outside of the bankruptcy plan.</text>

            <label>Ms. Susan M. Freeman</label>
            <text syncTime="3479.753" offset="14023429">Your Honor, one of the first things that Mr. Shah said was that the debtor should have set aside $29,000 from the sale proceeds to pay the taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.125" offset="14068882">That's $29,000 in sale proceeds of property of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.779" offset="14083511">And yes, those are ordinarily set aside to pay the taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.965" offset="14096259">That's how bankruptcy cases work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.815" offset="14103677">Because you have 1222(a)(2)(A), that $29,000 didn't need to be used to pay the taxes, and instead was set aside to be treated under the plan of reorganization, where that tax claim could be demoted in priority to a prepetition claim and discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.592" offset="14170760">But the ordinary course is that the sale proceeds are used to pay the taxes, the administrative expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.663" offset="14195001">That's how bankruptcy works.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.198" offset="14201166">And the government's argument here completely undercuts that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.400" offset="14214019">With respect to section 1305, the language is different because it uses the word "payable".</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.388" offset="14237947">It includes all postpetition, postconfirmation, all the way through to the end of the bankruptcy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.625" offset="14262920">Not just the short period of administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.744" offset="14275354">In Chapter 13 cases, you still have to pay administrative expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.461" offset="14290192">It's just that it's pretty rare that you have a tax that is incurred during that short period of administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.599" offset="14314747">And so you have a separate statute that covers the whole period through the entirety of the plan of reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.455" offset="14342228">The Court -- Mr. Shah was asked about cases where -- and in fact an administrative expense claim was incurred for a capital gains tax in the Chapter 12 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.429" offset="14390084">We would cite the Court to the Specht case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.896" offset="14400010">A copy of that is attached to the professors' amicus brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.981" offset="14412340">And that shows where a plan was defeated because of the large capital gains tax from the sale of the family farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.821" offset="14439717">And that in fact is cited in some of the -- some of the legislative -- not the legislative history, but some of the commentary about one of the reasons why Senator Grassley supported section 1222(a)(2)(A) and drafted it in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.580" offset="14498753">This prevents a plan from being confirmed in so many Chapter 12 cases, family farmers are not able to go through with their plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.084" offset="14528742">And that's why you have the demotion in priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.852" offset="14539818">It does have very little practical value if in fact it only applies to prepetition sales -- and not just prepetition but more than a year prepetition in most instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.629" offset="14598959">The professors' amicus brief just refers to prepetition, and this little chart doesn't say that those are not within the scope of 507(a)(8) -- and those eighth priority -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.</text>
