            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-1259, United States v. Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.651" offset="135983">Mr. Dreeben.</text>

            <text syncTime="8.290" offset="138595">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.038" offset="153537">Since this Court's decision in Katz v. United States, the Court has recognized a basic dichotomy under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.537" offset="183526">What a person seeks to preserve as private in the enclave of his own home or in a private letter or inside of his vehicle when he is traveling is a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.421" offset="235144">But what he reveals to the world, such as his movements in a car on a public roadway, is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.060" offset="265655">In Knotts v. United States, this Court applied that principle to hold that visual and beeper surveillance of a vehicle traveling on the public roadways infringed no Fourth Amendment expectation of privacy.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="54.804" stopTime="74.032">
            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="54.804" offset="324587">Knotts, though, seems to me much more like traditional surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.773" offset="344545">You're following the car and the beeper just helps you follow it from a -- from a slightly greater distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.330" offset="370772">That was 30 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.812" offset="376623">The technology is very different and you get a lot more information from the GPS surveillance than you do from following a beeper.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="74.032" offset="401596">The technology is different, Mr. Chief Justice, but a crucial fact in Knotts that shows that this was not simply amplified visual surveillance is that the officers actually feared detection in Knotts as the car crossed from Minnesota to Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.009" offset="465439">The driver began to do certain U-turns and the police broke off visual surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.476" offset="487278">They lost track of the car for a full hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.584" offset="499712">They only were able to discover it by having a beeper receiver in a helicopter that detected the beeps from the radio transmitter in the can of chloroform.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="109.626" offset="543911">But that's a good example of the change in technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.623" offset="551957">That's a lot of work to follow the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.515" offset="559480">They've got to listen to the beeper; when they lose it they have got to call in the helicopter.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.778" offset="572541">Here they just sit back in the station and they -- they push a button whenever they want to find out where the car is.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.043" offset="593544">They look at data from a month and find out everywhere it's been in the past month.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.243" offset="610367">That -- that seems to me dramatically different.</text>

            <text syncTime="128.743" offset="620398">But it doesn't expose anything, Mr. Chief Justice, that isn't already exposed to public view for anyone who wanted to watch, and that was the crucial principle that the Court applied--</text>

            <text syncTime="145.439" offset="687167">--Probably not, Justice Kennedy; and the reason is that this Court in Karo v. United States -- United States v.

            <text syncTime="168.725" offset="780372">In that event, Justice Kennedy, there is a serious question about whether the installation of such a device would implicate either a search or a seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.502" offset="815480">But if it did not, the public movements of somebody do not implicate a seizure.</text>

            <text syncTime="199.152" offset="901998">I have to give a little prologue to my question.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.477" offset="919343">When -- when wiretapping first came before this Court, we held that it was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment because the Fourth Amendment says that the --</text>
            <text syncTime="215.020" offset="965528">"the people shall be secured in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures; and wiretapping just picked up conversations. "</text>
            <text syncTime="226.171" offset="1010145">"That's not persons, houses, papers and effects. "</text>
            <text syncTime="228.511" offset="1019444">Later on, we reversed ourselves and, as you mentioned, Katz established the new criterion, which is, is there an invasion of privacy?</text>
            <text syncTime="238.276" offset="1058523">Does -- are you obtaining information that a person had a reasonable expectation to be kept private?</text>
            <text syncTime="245.147" offset="1086004">I think that was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.539" offset="1091542">I don't think that was the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.365" offset="1106902">But nonetheless it's been around for so long, we are not going to overrule that.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.613" offset="1119859">However, it is one thing to add that privacy concept to the Fourth Amendment as it originally existed and it is quite something else to use that concept to narrow the Fourth Amendment from what it originally meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.574" offset="1179732">And it seems to me that when that device is installed against the will of the owner of the car on the car, that is unquestionably a trespass and thereby rendering the owner of the car not secure in his effects -- the car is one of his effects -- against an unreasonable search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.144" offset="1273981">It is attached to the car against his will, and it is a search because what it obtains is the location of that car from there forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.171" offset="1310135">Now, why -- why isn't that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="505.120" offset="2125887">But with computers, it's now so simple to amass an enormous amount of information about people that consists of things that could have been observed on the streets, information that was made available to the public.</text>
