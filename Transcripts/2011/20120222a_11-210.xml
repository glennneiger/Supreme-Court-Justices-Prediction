            <text syncTime="244.940" offset="1086481">But they are substantial constraints that are satisfied in this case because the Stolen Valor Act regulates a very narrowly drawn and specific category of calculated factual falsehood, a verifiably false claim that an individual has won a military honor, and that's information that is within -- and only punishes speech about yourself.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.540" offset="1172894">So it is speech that is uniquely within the knowledge of the individual speaker.</text>
