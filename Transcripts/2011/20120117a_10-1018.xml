            <text syncTime="7.417" offset="136067">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.788" offset="145575">When a private attorney is temporarily retained by the government to work in coordination with or under the direct supervision of government employees in fulfilling the government's business, in getting the government's work done, that attorney is entitled to the same immunity that a government employee performing that same function for that same government would receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.997" offset="238467">In this case that is qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.263" offset="247453">That rule comports with the history and policy concerns that have animated this Court's section 1983 and immunity jurisprudence.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="45.352" offset="287890">Is that across the board, Ms. Millett, the rule you just stated?</text>
            <text syncTime="49.680" offset="305131">Is there any situation in which a private attorney engaged to assist a government office in the performance of a public function would lack qualified immunity?</text>
            <text syncTime="63.613" offset="360929">Or is it simply whenever a government agency employs a private attorney to assist it in doing its work that attorney will have qualified immunity?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="patricia_a_millett" startTime="74.153" stopTime="126.726">
            <label>Ms. Patricia A. Millett</label>
            <text syncTime="74.153" offset="403038">I think it -- it may well be the latter rule, the more broader one, but for these purposes, the Court only needs to decide the situation when they are working in -- in coordination with or under direct supervision of government employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.679" offset="453193">And I want to clarify that answer, because how one defines doing a public service -- for example, if a State government appoints somebody to represent one of their police officers who's been sued in a 1983 action, if there is five defendants the attorney general can't represent them all, they will commonly appoint people and will pay them, some States will pay them from the State fisc.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.561" offset="544726">So they will be paid by the government to perform a governmental function in that sense, but their allegiance there is to the individual employee, not to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.447" offset="580253">The same with public defenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.777" offset="585582">So there are certain situations where someone can be retained by the government in that sense, paid by the government in that sense.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="126.726" stopTime="145.311">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="126.726" offset="613376">Why does it matter whether the privately retained attorney works in close cooperation with government employees?</text>
            <text syncTime="133.629" offset="640961">Suppose in this case Mr. Filarsky had simply been hired to go off and perform this investigation, and at the end of the investigation report the results to the town?</text>
            <text syncTime="143.689" offset="681190">Would the case come out differently then?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="patricia_a_millett" startTime="145.311" stopTime="191.341">
            <label>Ms. Patricia A. Millett</label>
            <text syncTime="145.311" offset="687668">I don't think that would, but in this -- but I think it depends on what one means by coordination with or supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.511" offset="712537">And with respect to attorneys, attorneys can never be an independent contractor in relationship to their client in the way the prison was in Richardson.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.009" offset="754437">Attorneys just can't be.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.147" offset="759035">They are always, in the sense of the rule that I'm using it, working for their client agency, their client government, and under its control and authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.347" offset="795815">And the decisions they make are the decisions of that client.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.239" offset="811384">And that's why the whole -- the whole reason we should have this rule is understanding what immunity protects.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.455" offset="836253">It protects government decisionmaking, governmental conduct, and its ability to maneuver with an area -- in an area of reasoned decisionmaking.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="191.341" stopTime="221.687">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="191.341" offset="871779">And I suppose -- I suppose you can argue that there is a built-in limitation because the question doesn't even come up unless there is State action.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.292" offset="903649">So there has to be close enough cooperation so there is State action.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.461" offset="920263">I had never thought that when a private attorney gives an opinion letter to a government agency or government entity at its request that there is any State action there at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.097" offset="974806">So that question -- so there the question just wouldn't even come up; am I correct?</text>
            <text syncTime="221.016" offset="990480">I assume--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="patricia_a_millett" startTime="221.687" stopTime="308.011">
            <label>Ms. Patricia A. Millett</label>
            <text syncTime="221.687" offset="993196">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.155" offset="995077">Certainly the State action limitation both limits the operation of this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.187" offset="1011169">There's many times attorneys or others who work with the government will not implicate the State action rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.807" offset="1033634">And that's sort of the irony of -- of this case, and I think it would not be uncommon in attorney cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.460" offset="1056308">The only reason this was a tort, or an alleged tort, is because the government was involved, because governmental actors took his advice, conducted a search -- he didn't -- issued an order -- he didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.521" offset="1108553">And yet we have -- we're left in this is odd world where the only way this tort, constitutional tort lawsuit, can go forward is without the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.438" offset="1136243">Now, 1983 is about deterring governmental conduct, but this Court's immunity jurisprudence says we don't over-deter and we want to allow the government to operate within a realm of reasoned decisionmaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.619" offset="1196952">And they need to operate within that realm, get reasoned advice and make reasoned decisions, regardless of whether the source of the advice is a temporarily or permanently retained attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.539" offset="1236553">The need is for reasoned decisionmaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.706" offset="1257242">And if you over-deter, which is what an action against a private attorney who is now charged with litigating and defending the government's allegedly unconstitutional conduct, standing all alone while all the government actors have walked away, that turns section 1983 on its head.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="308.011" offset="1338535">But your test -- and this is, I think goes broader than the articulation of the test -- doesn't give this private attorney much assurance by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.383" offset="1371972">It's sort of a multifactor, is he is coordinating, is he under the supervision, is he really doing public service?</text>
            <text syncTime="321.600" offset="1392870">I mean, if the idea is to give him sufficient breathing room so he doesn't stop, and when, as in this case, he is threatened that we are going to sue you if you do this, he has to think, well now, am I being supervised by the government?</text>
            <text syncTime="332.254" offset="1435502">Am I coordinating with the government?</text>
            <text syncTime="335.721" offset="1449294">Or I -- am I telling them what -- it -- the -- the test itself undermines the asserted purpose.</text>

            <label>Ms. Patricia A. Millett</label>
            <text syncTime="343.936" offset="1482209">Well, two responses to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.778" offset="1485552">First of all, the State law requirement, the State action requirement that Justice Kennedy referred to, will up front require allegations by the plaintiffs that will discuss the coordinated, presumably the coordinated action, because there has to be some level of coordination.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.959" offset="1538320">But the second reason is, as I said, with respect to attorneys, I don't think this is going to be a hard question, because they are forever agents and fiduciaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.209" offset="1567263">They can never be the independent contractor that you had in Richardson.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.552" offset="1576667">They are always answerable to and working for their governmental client.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.456" offset="1600282">And when I say supervision here, I don't think the test here is -- is an on-hands, day-to-day looking over your shoulders.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.232" offset="1631420">The government has to be able to get the advice of professionals and to trust them--</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="386.087" offset="1650751">Suppose -- suppose the government hires an attorney to do an independent investigation; it hires an outside attorney precisely because it does not want to be faced with allegations that it has manipulated the outcome of the investigation because its own conduct is at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.301" offset="1715639">So they say, you are going to be independent, hands-off, we are not going to interfere at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.752" offset="1729432">But that would still in your -- in your submission satisfy the coordination requirement?</text>

            <text syncTime="411.219" offset="1751270">--It -- it would in this sense, because there would be -- and I am assuming here we are not talking like a Bivens appointment or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.527" offset="1772586">But here -- because understand what happens in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.525" offset="1784498">They are being appointed to investigate for the government and on behalf of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.040" offset="1806649">And it's not usually because we say the government writ large may have done something that would create a conflict.</text>

            <text syncTime="442.689" offset="1877180">The private prison -- the guard in the private prison is performing a function that has been delegated to that or assumed by that entity pursuant to a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.387" offset="1932037">I don't understand exactly what the difference is.</text>

            <label>Ms. Patricia A. Millett</label>
            <text syncTime="458.575" offset="1940710">--The difference is -- there is a practical difference and then a legal doctrinal difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.027" offset="1950532">The practical difference is that in Richardson it was a quite unique situation where the government really had washed its hands of the prison operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.321" offset="1987730">It had put the day-to-day operation of the prison, the decisionmaking of the prison, how we treat the prisoners entirely in the hands of a private contractor, subject only to what this Court said was very limited supervision, essentially in contract terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.531" offset="2052618">But it had ceded that authority and it did not exercise the control.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.061" offset="2070695">It did not exercise the day-to-day decisionmaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.686" offset="2081144">And that's where we get into the doctrinal point.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.652" offset="2089085">So the decisions that were being made there, and that were -- the lawsuit concerned, there wasn't a single governmental defendant named in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.900" offset="2118029">It was just simply the private -- the private guards that were at issue there.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.430" offset="2132135">And the decisions that were made were the private company's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.756" offset="2145510">And so this Court said there, that's not what qualified immunity is out -- is out to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.863" offset="2169856">It is to protect what, the government's decisionmaking, the special concerns that arise when you are bringing lawsuits that are designed to regulate, limit, deter governmental decisionmaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.876" offset="2209980">We have to protect that area of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.873" offset="2225967">If the government's not making the decision, they have passed the buck, they have handed it off, then there is nothing to protect.</text>

            <text syncTime="836.072" offset="3450692">First of all, we don't even want the subconscious pressures that would come with full freight liability for governmental conduct to any angry third party even subconsciously interfering with the decisions of government lawyers temporarily or permanently retained.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.408" offset="3516103">Secondly, we want the government to be able to get the advice, to be encouraged to get the advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.142" offset="3535015">Section 1983 must support governments getting legal advice to counsel them in complying with the law that section 1983 enforces, but government will be deterred from obtaining legal advice if the costs of getting an attorney -- especially if you're a small town, municipality, county, you don't -- can't afford a full-time staff, and the cost of getting an attorney is all those things that qualified immunity wanted to protect against.</text>

            <text syncTime="1188.441" offset="4860259">The Court needed and the purposes of qualified immunity wouldn't be served in terms of deterrence and in ensuring good government decision making.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.686" offset="4889203">But the market forces discussion was the Court reassuring itself in those circumstances that there would still be private prison companies that would be willing to take on the business of government and would be able to do it, you know, consistent with the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.589" offset="4940821">So we don't understand the Court to have been setting out market forces as a test for qualified immunity, because, as your question seems to suggest, taken to its logical conclusion, any time a private person is being hired by the government, you could say, well, there is a market for the person, couldn't someone else fill those shoes, et cetera, et cetera.</text>

            <text syncTime="1317.167" offset="5375080">I am just explaining that the way we read the Court's opinion in Richardson, which obviously the members of this Court are the experts on, is that the Court was looking to market forces to reassure itself after it determined that the purposes of qualified immunity just wouldn't be served by giving an organization that was so far removed from the day-to-day workings of government the protection of qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.630" offset="5452925">The Court just -- the market forces really was just something unique to that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.705" offset="5469226">And what we think is the most relevant is what the Court started with both in the decision in Wyatt and in Richardson, which is, is it necessary to give qualified immunity here to make sure there is principled and fearless government decisionmaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.027" offset="5518545">It's the business of government that's important.</text>

            <text syncTime="1367.662" offset="5577059">And to the extent that he cabins the advice that he gave to the fire department officials, that affects the ability of government to do their job.</text>

            <text syncTime="1405.132" offset="5727002">And I'm not sure how it can, given the independent fiduciary duty that an attorney has to zealously guard his or her client's interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1430.634" offset="5828984">And there is just no difference when he is operating in this case that would make him distinguishable from a government attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.445" offset="5852181">To answer another suggestion, I think, in your question, the Court talked about in terms of deterrence and chilling, making sure that there were talented candidates who wanted to take on the position of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.818" offset="5893768">So the Court has never said, you know, we are concerned about wiping out the market entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.579" offset="5912785">It said, you know, if there is a segment of the market that will not take on this business anymore, that's a fairly serious problem when we need to make sure that the government business is done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.812" offset="5945699">And if I can just make -- give the Court another example to, perhaps outside the context of this case, see how a private person being denied qualified immunity would affect government employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.245" offset="5987391">Consider a fire department that has some full-time fire department personnel and also some volunteer firefighters.</text>

            <label>Ms. Patricia A. Millett</label>

            <text syncTime="3492.344" offset="14075841">Justice Breyer, your dilemma is -- is at the crux of why qualified immunity is appropriate here, because not only do you have the lawyer saying well, you'll be all okay but I'm going to be going down in this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.713" offset="14125265">You are going to have a duty to inform this client that in fact this will lead to litigation; you will be protected in your personal capacity, but guess what, litigation is going to ensue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.443" offset="14172181">That can influence and -- and deter both lawyers' willingness to work for the government at these cut rates or pro bono rates -- subconsciously, the advice they give, and it can make the government not want to act on the advice, which is precisely what we want to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.110" offset="14226934">Nothing like that was happening in Richardson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.250" offset="14247414">The government was nowhere on the scene when the constitutional decisions being challenged -- they weren't even percipient witnesses in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.417" offset="14276148">The second -- second point I want to make is fiduciary duty doesn't change it other than it confirms that he's working in the interest of the government, but every agent has a fiduciary duty to their principal, and so you can't deny qualified immunity on that ground or you'll have a sweeping decision on your hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.865" offset="14341872">The market concerns, Justice Sotomayor, the test is not whether a warm body could be found to fulfill this operation if he won't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.924" offset="14378130">This is a completely different market from Richardson, where there's only one client for prisons and that's the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.687" offset="14401223">Here, the government is competing for the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.854" offset="14421912">When it needs a skilled attorney, when it wants people of the caliber that the government service needs and deserves, it is competing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.698" offset="14449288">And right now, as the Chief Justice recognized, a lot of times, including for Mr. Filarsky, that's done at discount rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.193" offset="14479172">These folks -- this is already a marginal decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.020" offset="14490561">If you want to talk about market decisions, then you're going to push that weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.360" offset="14507907">And if the answer is -- if you decide to take on this pro bono representation, or cut your rates out of public duty, and -- and the willingness to serve your government, guess what comes with it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.047" offset="14554614">You alone will be holding the bag at the end of this for the governmental misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.920" offset="14578124">Section 1983 is supposed to deter governmental conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.198" offset="14595260">It is not supposed to deter the reasonable advice given by lawyers to governmental clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.523" offset="14628488">If the Court has no further questions.</text>
