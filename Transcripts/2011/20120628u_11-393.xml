            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="109568">In the 1930s, Congress responded to the need of senior citizens for old-age and survivors' insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.029" offset="153663">It did so by making social security, a tax based entirely federal program.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.069" offset="185741">In 2010, Congress addressed the public's need for affordable health care when sickness or injury occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.882" offset="225029">Congress did so by taking a path unlike the one it took for social security instead of an entirely federal program.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.266" offset="266616">The Affordable Health Care Act gives states and private insurers important roles in insuring medical care for those who need it.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.038" offset="309666">The question the Court must answer is whether the Constitution stops Congress from taking the course it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.491" offset="347491">I would answer emphatically no.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.171" offset="366195">I agree with the Chief Justice that Congress' power to tax and spend supports the so-called individual mandate or minimum coverage provision, but I would make that an auxiliary holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.398" offset="431083">As I see it, Congress' vast authority to regulate interstate commerce solidly undergirds the affordable health care legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.611" offset="483955">I would uphold the legislation first and foremost on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.953" offset="509346">Since 1937, this Court has deferred, as it should, to Congress' policymaking in the economic and social realm.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.939" offset="557307">Today, a majority of the Court rules that the Commerce Clause is not equal to the task.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.186" offset="586250">That ruling harks back to the era ended 75 years ago when the Court routinely thwarted legislative efforts to regulate the economy in the interest of those who labor to sustain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.320" offset="658766">It is a stunning setback.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.453" offset="675380">It should not have staying power.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.392" offset="695129">The Court's majority would compare health insurance to any other commodity, broccoli for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.563" offset="731805">If the Government can compel people to buy insurance, then there was no commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.670" offset="760226">The Government can't force people to purchase, so the argument goes, but health care is not like vegetables or other items one is at liberty to buy or not to buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.516" offset="819576">All of us will need health care, some sooner, some later, but we can't tell when, where or how dire our need will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.617" offset="867955">A healthy 21-year-old, for example, may tomorrow be the victim of an accident that leaves him or her an invalid, in need of constant and costly medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.675" offset="932216">Further, to get broccoli, one must pay at the counter, not so of health care.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.675" offset="960219">The accident victim who cannot pay the steep price of medical services will nevertheless receive emergency and follow-up care because the law and professional ethics so require and because ours is a humane society, but people who do purchase insurance end up footing the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.020" offset="1053633">By requiring the healthy uninsured either to obtain insurance or pay a toll, Congress sought to end this free ride.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.212" offset="1098355">It is shortsighted moreover to see the mandate as a decree that the hale and hearty young people subsidize care rendered to older, less healthy people.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.428" offset="1159272">In the fullness of time, today's young and healthy will become society's old and infirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.646" offset="1192082">Viewed over a lifespan, the cost and benefits even out.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.207" offset="1218309">And as I just observed, the youth who does not want insurance today may find that tomorrow she desperately needs the services insurance is designed to secure.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.855" offset="1276928">What the mandate does essentially is to require people to prepay for medical care to insurance instead of waiting, expecting to pay out-of-pocket at the point of service when in reality many will lack the money to cover the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.175" offset="1362192">The Chief Justice reasons that Congress can use its commerce power to regulate something already in existence, but cannot create that something in order to regulate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.531" offset="1419661">But the interstate health insurance and health care markets are not Congress' creations.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.557" offset="1443694">Both existed well before the enactment of the Affordable HealthCare Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.095" offset="1469921">I have already emphasized the unique attributes of the health care market, the fact that all of us will be in it sooner or later and cannot predict exactly when the huge free ride, a problem caused by people who refrain from purchasing insurance then become sick or injured and get care cost free to them but costly for those of us who have paid in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.482" offset="1579426">Because there is no comparable market, the slippery slope envisioned by the Court's majority, if health insurance today then broccoli tomorrow, is far more imaginary than real.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.520" offset="1639612">As a learned jurist once commented, judges and lawyers live on the slippery slope of analogies.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.370" offset="1670959">They are not supposed to skid to the bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.382" offset="1687050">Yes, the insurance purchase mandate is novel, but novelty is no reason to reject it.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.360" offset="1718920">As our economy grows and changes, Congress must be competent to devise legislation meeting current day social and economic realities.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.835" offset="1764895">For that reason, the Necessary and Proper Clause was included in the Constitution to ensure that the Federal Government would have the capacity to provide for conditions and developments, the framers knew they could scarcely foresee.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.656" offset="1832187">In enacting the Affordable Health Care Act, Congress' aim was to reduce the large numbers of U.S. residents, some 50 million in 2009, who lacked health insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.372" offset="1891015">Congress was aware that the vast majority of those people lack insurance not by choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.062" offset="1941797">One group of particular concern to Congress were individuals with preexisting medical conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.122" offset="1973979">Before the Affordable Health Care Act's enactment, the insurance industry charged these individuals steep prices or flatly denied them coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.447" offset="2015253">Congress understood, however, that a simple ban on those practices would not work without the mandate to -- to acquire insurance covering those with preexisting conditions would trigger a death spiral in the heath insurance market.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.877" offset="2085052">Many people would not buy insurance until they suffered sickness or injury, premiums would skyrocket, more people would be added to the ranks of the uninsured because they could not pay the steep premiums and eventually, insurance companies left with a pool of high risk policyholders would exit the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.323" offset="2170838">With the mandate, the job could be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.489" offset="2183481">Access to insurance would be available and affordable and uncompensated care would be hugely reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.563" offset="2219739">In no way was Congress' action improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.403" offset="2235099">The mandate acts directly on individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.442" offset="2247325">It does not commandeer the States as intermediaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.554" offset="2263730">And along with other provisions of the Act, it addresses the sort of country-wide problem that made the Commerce Clause essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.698" offset="2304272">The crisis created by the many millions of U.S. residents who lack health insurance is hardly contained within state boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.727" offset="2344396">Far from encroaching on state prerogatives, the Affordable Health Care Act supplies a better response to remedy the States acting separately are incapable of meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.618" offset="2399984">This Court has long recognized that the power to regulate interstate commerce is an affirmative power commensurate with national needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.938" offset="2441258">While the Court upholds the mandate, as it surely should, it also regrettably helms in Congress' commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.002" offset="2485561">In doing so, the Court invites assaults on national legislation irreconcilable with the framers' anticipation.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.968" offset="2521401">Their understanding and expectation was that the Commerce Clause would empower Congress to act in all cases for the general interest of the Union and also in those instances in which the States are separately incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.007" offset="2609591">My dissent from the Court's retrogressive reading of the Commerce Clause is joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.563" offset="2647730">There is a further issue; Congress' expansion of Medicaid to include a larger portion of the Nation's poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.011" offset="2689526">Medicaid is the prototypical example of federal-state cooperation.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.602" offset="2715961">Rather than authorizing a federal agency to administer a uniform national health care system for the poor, as Congress did in establishing Medicare for seniors, Congress offered States the opportunity to tailor Medicaid grants to their particular needs so long as they remain within bounds set by the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.692" offset="2812301">Congress reserved the right to alter, amend or repeal any and every provision of the Medicaid Act and participating States for their part agreed to amend their Medicaid plans consistent with alterations in the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.036" offset="2885653">From 1965 until 2010, States regularly conformed to amendments expanding Medicaid, sometimes quite sizably.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.830" offset="2936853">The 2010 expansion is different in kind the Court concludes 7-to-2.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.242" offset="2962453">Justice Sotomayor and I strongly disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.504" offset="2987530">According to the Chief Justice, the expansion was misnamed.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.784" offset="3000696">It did not expand Medicaid as it existed in 2010 he maintains instead Congress established a wholly new program alongside old Medicaid and coerced the States to accept new Medicaid by threatening them with loss of funds from the old program if they hold out.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.759" offset="3096513">On this reasoning, the Court, for the first time ever, finds an exercise of Congress' spending power unconstitutionally coercive.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.295" offset="3146668">In truth, however, Medicaid is a single program with one constant aim to enable poor persons to receive basic health care when they need it.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.019" offset="3193584">What the expansion does is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.585" offset="3207899">It adds more people, all of them poor, to the Medicaid eligible population.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.292" offset="3242695">Congress did not otherwise change the operation of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.029" offset="3265682">The Chief Justice justifies his characterization of the expansion as a new program on three grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.021" offset="3289610">First, he says, by covering those earning up to 133% of the federal poverty line, the expansion, unlike Medicaid as originality enacted, does not care for the neediest among us.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.756" offset="3368500">The expansion covers individuals earning less than $15,000 annually.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.838" offset="3396817">Those low earners, on any fair assessment, ranked among the Nation's poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.688" offset="3424298">Second, the Chief observes that newly eligible people receive a level of coverage less comprehensive than the traditional Medicaid package.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.057" offset="3465780">But the Affordable Health Care Act did not introduce the less comprehensive package.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.382" offset="3487096">Since 2006, states had been free to use it for many of their Medicaid beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.453" offset="3523354">Third, the reimbursement rate for participating States is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.753" offset="3540490">True, but that rate is markedly more generous than the usual federal contribution, hardly something the States can complain about.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.320" offset="3582809">The Federal Government picks up 100% of the tab initially gradually reducing to 90%.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.337" offset="3614887">Suppose Congress had, from the start, made Medicaid eligible all those originally covered plus those added by the expansion, that would be unobjectionable under the Chief Justice's reasoning, but we have never held that a grant program becomes two rather one when Congress lays a foundation and later lose on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.161" offset="3718123">Congress can and often does expand programs adding new conditions that grant recipients must meet in order to continue receiving funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.896" offset="3769114">Our decision, I acknowledge -- our decisions have hypothesized that a financial inducement might pass the point where a pressure becomes coercion and therefore exceed Congress' spending power, but until today, that prospect has remained theoretical.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.879" offset="3856990">The Court had found no case fitting the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.803" offset="3876739">Recall that Congress reserved to itself, when it adopted Medicaid in 1965, the right to alter, amend, even repeal any and every provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.900" offset="3929088">This Court long ago explained just what those words mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.824" offset="3944761">They mean Congress retains full and complete power to make such alterations and amendments as come within the just scope of the legislative power.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.140" offset="3998051">States have not missed that meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.948" offset="4009336">Each time a State notified the Federal Government of a change it made in its own Medicaid plan, it certified both that it knew the federally set terms of participations could change and that it would abide by the changes as a condition of continued participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.817" offset="4096794">Today's decision holds that Congress can alter a spending program somewhat, but not too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.325" offset="4130858">We can anticipate bolder challenges than in the past urging that a congressional amendment goes too far turning pressure into compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.203" offset="4178296">When those challenges arrive, my colleagues may comprehend the wisdom of the observation that conceptions of impermissible coercion premised on a State's perceived inability to decline federal funds are just too amorphous to be judicially administrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.636" offset="4268053">At bottom, my colleagues' position is that the States' reliance on federal funds limits Congress' authority to alter its spending programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.331" offset="4318835">This gets things backward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.456" offset="4331374">Congress, not the States, is tasked by the Constitution with spending federal money in service of their general welfare and each successive Congress is empowered to appropriate funds as it sees fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.006" offset="4405561">When the 111th Congress reached a conclusion about the portion of the Nation's poor that should qualify for Medicaid apportioned larger than a predecessor Congress covered, the later Congress abridged no States' right to existing or preexisting funds for in truth there are no such funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.098" offset="4505872">It is only money the States anticipate receiving, but can scarcely insist on receiving from future Congresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.534" offset="4547668">Seven Members of the Court, however, buy the argument that prospective withholding of anticipated funds exceeds Congress' spending power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.201" offset="4590299">Given that holding, I entirely agree with the Chief Justice as to the appropriate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.538" offset="4615690">It is to bar the withholding found impermissible not to scrap the expansion altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.856" offset="4648918">This Court has many times explained that when it confirms a statute marred by a constitutional infirmity, its endeavor must be to salvage, not demolish the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.207" offset="4706388">The Court does that by declaring the statute invalid to the extent it reaches too far, but otherwise leaving the statute intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.031" offset="4753617">Because the Court finds the withholding, not the granting of federal funds, incompatible with the Spending Clause, Congress' extension of Medicaid remains available to any State affirming its willingness to accept the uncommonly generous federal grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.106" offset="4841911">So, in the end, the Affordable Health Care Act survives largely unscathed, but the Court's Commerce and Spending Clause jurisprudence has been set array.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.206" offset="4902306">My expectation is that the setbacks will be temporary glyphs, not permanent obstructions.</text>
