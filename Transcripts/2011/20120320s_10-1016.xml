            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">As we've just heard, Justices Breyer, Sotamayor, Kagan join me in dissenting from today's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.710" offset="151259">The entire Family and Medial Leave Act we would hold, including the self-care provision is a proper exercise of Congress' power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.920" offset="208102">The Act was designed to promote women's opportunities to live balanced lives at home having gainful employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.639" offset="246972">A particular problem Congress faced was the disadvantageous treatment of women on pregnancy or childbirth requires them to take time away from work.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.769" offset="299426">The best way to protect women against losing their jobs because of pregnancy or childbirth, Congress determine was not to order leaves for women only for that would deter employers from hiring them.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.599" offset="362747">Instead, Congress adopted leave policies from which all could benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.818" offset="387720">The Act was a work-in-progress for some seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.827" offset="403707">In that time, Congress received evidence from individuals and organizations documenting pervasive discrimination against women based on pregnancy or the potential to become pregnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.226" offset="461281">Congress also found that pregnant women were at risk of losing their jobs in the public sector just as they were in the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.796" offset="503599">Maryland as defendant in this case noted a 1974 decision of this Court, Geduldig v. Aiello.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.398" offset="541947">Footnote 20 of the Aiello opinion stated that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy is not discrimination on the basis of gender as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.863" offset="591893">That is so, the Court reasoned because many non-pregnant persons are female.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.089" offset="620732">Today's case is a fit occasion to revisit and reject the Court's reasoning in Aiello.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.202" offset="653228">To say that a classification based on pregnancy is gender neutral, Justice Stevens later pointed out, makes no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.949" offset="684157">By definition he explained, disadvantageous treatment on the basis of pregnancy discriminates on account of sex for it is the capacity to become pregnant which primarily differentiates the female from the male.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.293" offset="749568">As the Court chronicled nine years ago in Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs, a woman's childbearing capacity and attended myths about motherhood and women's lack of commitment to work underlie the historic and not yet banished discrimination against women in gainful employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.145" offset="840997">I would hold that Aiello was egregiously wrong in wiping discrimination on the basis of pregnancy as something other than discrimination on the basis of sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.298" offset="893555">The requisite congruence and proportionality, I would also hold, exists between the right to be free from pregnancy discrimination in the workplace and the self-care provision at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.860">Congress, as I earlier observed, made claim its rationale for entitling all employees to take leave for a serious health condition rather than singling out pregnancy or childbirth.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.842">Reluctance to hire or promote women, Congress comprehended, would attend the pregnancy only leave requirement, but self-care leave for all would ward off that effect for men take sick leave about as often as women do.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.776">Self-care leave is a key part of Congress' endeavor to make it feasible for women to work and have families.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.851">The FMLA as a whole and in all of its parts advances women's economic opportunities and supports a more egalitarian relationship at home and at work.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.259">The inequality Congress sought to overcome seems to me well within the national legislature's authority to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.597">The Court's judgment dilutes the force of the Act and that is regrettable, but at least the damage is contained.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.268">The self-care provision remains valid Commerce Clause legislation and therefore applies undiluted in the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.460">States remain bound by the self-care provision to this extent though private individuals may not recover damages when a state employer violates the self-care provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.087">Injunctive relief against the responsible state official maybe possible and the Department of Labor has authority to sue a state employer for violating the self-care provision and to gain monetary relief for adversely affected employees.</text>
