            <text syncTime="9.706" offset="142190">Two factors distinguish this case from those in which the Court has found cause lacking to excuse a default: First, the State itself had a direct hand in the extraordinary events leading up to the default in this case; and second, the actions of Maples' attorneys, which rise to the level of abandonment, are not attributable to Maples under agency law or other principles that this Court has invoked in determining when attorney conduct may be imputed to a client.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.756" offset="254412">For either or both of those reasons, the default at issue in this case is not fairly attributable to Cory Maples and the contrary decision of the Eleventh Circuit should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="172.578" offset="793684">First, we do think that it was well known in Alabama that, under this unique system, out-of-State attorneys were doing all the work in these cases and local counsel were simply facilitating their admission.</text>

            <text syncTime="191.122" offset="867871">First, we do have the amicus briefs, which discuss that anecdotally.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.407" offset="881037">I would say that the State of Alabama in its brief in opposition to this Court a few years back in the Barbour case specifically touted the role of out-of-State attorneys under its system and as far as I could tell didn't mention local counsel once.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.334" offset="936730">So I think it was fair to say that it's known that the out-of-State attorneys here were doing all the work.</text>

            <text syncTime="3464.860" offset="13962846">What is troubling to me about the abandonment argument is that -- is the fear that if the Court says that abandonment is cause, there will be many, many cases in which the allegation is my attorney wasn't just ineffective and negligent, the attorney was so bad that the attorney in effect abandoned me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.172" offset="14044035">And that will substantially change existing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.809" offset="14062634">Now how can that be prevented?</text>

            <text syncTime="3491.428" offset="14069112">--Working through agency principles that go back to Justice Storey's time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.546" offset="14085517">Working through principles established in this Court's decision in Holland, and will be applied in Holland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.950" offset="14107146">The lower court in Holland issued a decision and found that Mr. Collins had abandoned Mr. Holland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.687" offset="14130134">Using this Court's precedence as a guide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.639" offset="14141942">So I think Holland already recognizes that attorney abandonment can be extreme; we're just asking the Court to apply the same principles in recognizing that what is external in one context can not be not external in the other context--</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="3521.197" offset="14188126">Counsel, do you know how often Holland's brief has been granted -- since it's very recent, but how -- how -- how frequently Collins relief has been granted by the courts below?</text>

            <text syncTime="3535.388" offset="14244968">I am not aware of any flood of relief in such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.742" offset="14258343">I expect that this would be very extreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.875" offset="14266911">I think the facts here are about as extreme as you can get.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="3544.729" offset="14282271">Mr. Garre, how do we distinguish between abandonment and simply a botched, very botched, transfer of responsibility within the law firm?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gregory_g_garre" startTime="3553.501" stopTime="3654.450">
            <label>Mr. Gregory G. Garre</label>
            <text syncTime="3553.501" offset="14317380">When you have counsel of record leaving without obtaining the approval required or telling the Court, I think that is abandonment pure and simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.357" offset="14352802">Beyond that, you would look to agency principles, whether it's a breach of loyalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.892" offset="14366908">This is going to be a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.326" offset="14372655">You would want to get into the facts, although I think it is a very high bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.630" offset="14389896">I think the Holland decision makes it a high bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.780" offset="14398464">I think this case thoroughly passes that bar, but it's something that the courts will work out applying agency principles and applying the Court's decision in Holland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.252" offset="14432423">Recognizing what Holland said in this case isn't going to create a new rule; it's simply going to extend logically the recognition that attorney abandonment is external to the client as it always has been under agency principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.745" offset="14486340">With respect to notice, this Court doesn't have to find a constitutional violation on the State's part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.815" offset="14506611">It's enough for cause that the Court finds that the State's actions are external.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.601" offset="14521762">And I think the key inquiry is what Justice Kagan recognized, which is you look to what a person who is actually desirous of providing notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.957" offset="14555199">In this situation, the clerk got two notices back, "left firm".</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.092" offset="14571708">It opened it up, it would have seen an order for a capital case and it did nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.111" offset="14587800">I don't think anyone who actually desired to provide notice with an inmate with his life on the line would do nothing reasonably in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.982" offset="14615280">Mr. Maples is not asking to be released from prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.851" offset="14626774">He is asking for an opportunity to present a serious constitutional claim of ineffective assistance of counsel to a Federal habeas court on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.857" offset="14662823">If the claims are as manifest as we think, that clearly will have little burden on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.392" offset="14680900">But simply allowing those claims to be adjudicated on the merits in Federal court will go a long way to preserve the legitimacy in criminal justice in a case in which a man's life is at stake.</text>
