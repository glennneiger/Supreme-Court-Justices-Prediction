            <text syncTime="212.383" offset="959930">But we all know that in the real world that to the extent that the Federal government continues to increase taxes that decreases the ability of the States to tax their own citizenry and it's a real tradeoff.</text>

            <text syncTime="240.367" offset="1071839">What I'm suggesting is that it's not simply the case that you can say, well, it's free money, so we don't even have to ask whether the program's coercive.</text>

            <text syncTime="253.024" offset="1122516">Meaning, as I look at the figures I've seen from amici, there are some states for whom the percentage of Medicaid funding to their budget is close to 40 percent, but there are others that are less than 10 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.803" offset="1189599">And you say, across the board this is coercive because no state, even at 10 percent, can give it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.957" offset="1214154">What's the percentage of big gift that the federal government can give?</text>
            <text syncTime="281.242" offset="1235365">Because what you're saying to me is, for a bankrupt state, there's no gift the federal government could give them ever, because it can only give them money without conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.816" offset="1281654">No matter how poorly the state is run, no matter how much the federal government doesn't want to subsidize abortions or doesn't want to subsidize some other state obligation, the federal government can't give them 100 percent of their needs.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="310.611" offset="1352812">And, Justice Sotomayor, I'm really saying the opposite, which is not that every gift is coercive, no matter what the amount, no matter how small.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.367" offset="1379875">I'm saying essentially the opposite, which is there has to be some limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.569" offset="1392622">There has to be some limit on coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.104" offset="1402758">And the reason is quite simple, because this Court's entire spending power jurisprudence is premised on the notion that spending power is different, and that Congress can do things pursuant to the spending power that it can't do pursuant to its other enumerated powers precisely because the programs are voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.297" offset="1467541">And if you relax that assumption that the programs are voluntary, and you are saying they are coercion, then you can't have the spending power jurisprudence--</text>

            <text syncTime="384.642" offset="1648936">One of them is the fact that this statute is tied to the decidedly nonvoluntary individual mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.598" offset="1676730">And that makes this unique, but it makes it significant, I think.</text>

            <text syncTime="397.902" offset="1702017">The second factor, of course, is the fact that Congress here made a distinct and conscious decision to tie the state's willingness to accept these new funds, not just to the new funds but to their entire participation in the statute, even though the coverage for these newly eligible individuals is segregated from the rest of the program.</text>

            <text syncTime="443.431" offset="1884142">One is, in some of the prior expansions of the program, but not all, Congress has made covering newly eligible individuals totally voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.703" offset="1917161">If the states wants to cover the newly eligible individuals, they will get additional money; but, if they don't, they don't risk any of their existing participation programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.040" offset="1946523">The 1972 program was a paradigm of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.475" offset="1956240">It created this 209(b) option for states to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.677" offset="1969092">This court talked about it in the Gray Panthers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.879" offset="1981840">There were other expansions that have taken place, such as the 1984 expansions, where they didn't give states that option; but, here's the second dimension in which this is distinct, which is, here, Congress has created a separate part of the program for the newly eligible mandatory individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.239" offset="2043280">That's what they called them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1258.749" offset="5145373">So if Congress tried to impose Title IX directly, I guess the question for this Court would be whether or not Section 5 of the 14th Amendment allowed Congress to do that?</text>

            <text syncTime="1651.750" offset="6717422">We're going to tie the hands of the Federal government in choosing how to structure a cooperative relationship with the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.939" offset="6754098">We're going to say to the Federal government, the bigger the problem, the less your powers are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.676" offset="6781057">Because once you give that much money, you can't structure the program the way you want.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.699" offset="6817210">It's our money, Federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.817" offset="6825674">We're going to have to run the program ourself to protect all our interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.304" offset="6847617">I don't see where to draw that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.423" offset="6860051">The uninsured are a problem for States only because they, too, politically, just like the Federal government, can't let the poor die.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.064" offset="6906653">And so to the extent they don't want to do that, it's because they feel accountable to their citizenry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.753" offset="6941344">And so if they want to do it their way, they have to spend the money to do it their way, if they don't want to do it the Federal way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1735.770" offset="7053461">One is, I actually think that sort of misdescribes what happened with Medicaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.939" offset="7066105">I mean, States were, as you suggest, providing for the poor and the visually impaired and disabled even before Medicaid came along.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.795" offset="7093586">Then all of a sudden, States -- the Federal government says look, we'd like to help you with that, and we're going to give you money voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.616" offset="7116887">And then over time, they give more money with more conditions, and now they decide they're going to totally expand the program, and they say that you have to give up even your prior program, where we -- first came in and offered you cooperation, we're now going to say you have to give that up if you don't take our new conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.625" offset="7184910">Secondarily, I do think that our principle is not that when you get past a certain level, it automatically becomes coercive per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.247" offset="7215316">But I do think when you get a program and you're basically telling States that look, we're going to take away $3.3 trillion over the next 10 years, that at that point, it's okay to insist that Congress be a little more careful that it not be so aggressively coercive as it was in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.526" offset="7284488">And I would simply say that -- we're not here to tell you that this is going to be an area where it's going to be very easy to draw the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.429" offset="7308103">We're just telling you that it's inceptionally important to draw that line, and this is a case where it ought to be easy to establish a beachhead, say that coercion matters, say there's three factors of this particular statute that make it as obviously coercive as any piece of legislation that you've ever seen, and then you will have effectively instructed Congress that there are limits, and you have laid down some administrable rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="2793.795" offset="11285507">But starting in the 1984 expansion, with respect to pregnant women and infants, it was an expansion of the entire program; States were given the choice to stay in the entire program or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.670" offset="11325004">1989 when the program was expanded to children under 6 years of age, under 133 percent of poverty, same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2818.846" offset="11385713">And so I just think the history of the program, and particularly when you read that in context of 42 U.S.C. 1304, which reserves the right of the Federal Government to amend the program going forward, shows you that this is something that the States have understood all along.</text>

            <text syncTime="2989.371" offset="12067822">It's much more nuanced than that, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.955" offset="12074196">There is something called a maintenance of effort provision which lasts until 2014, until such time as the Medicaid expansion takes place and the exchanges are in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.977" offset="12110245">That applies to the population.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.663" offset="12121008">It says with respect to the population, you can't take anybody out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.167" offset="12139084">It does not apply to the optional benefits where the States still have flexibility, they can still reduce optional benefits that they are now providing if they -- if they want to -- to control costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.041" offset="12182552">They can also work on provider rates, there's also with respect to demonstration projects by which some States have expanded their populations beyond the required eligibility levels, they don't have to keep them in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.580" offset="12228737">So -- and then there's also, if the State has a budgetary crisis, it can get a waiver of that, as Wisconsin did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.836" offset="12253710">So that is a -- that's a provision I think that does a significant degree less than my friends on the other side have suggested in terms of -- in terms of its effect, and its effect beyond that is just temporary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.608" offset="12292789">I do think with respect to the -- the first of their three arguments for coercion, the sheer size argument, that it's very difficult to see how that is going to work; because if the question is about what you stand to lose rather than what you stand to gain, then it seems to me that it doesn't matter whether the Medicaid expansion is substantial or whether it's modest, or whether there is any expansion at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.723" offset="12389233">The States, for example -- the Federal Government, for example, could decide that under -- under the current system too much money has ended up flowing to nursing care and that money would be better serving the general welfare if it were directed at infants and children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.733" offset="12445344">But if the Federal Government said we are going to redirect the spending priorities of the Federal money that we are offering to you, the States could say well, Geez, we don't like that; we would like to keep spending the money the way we were, and we have no choice, because this has gotten too big for us to exit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.243" offset="12503336">And so -- and in fact, it seems to me, standing here today before these expansions take place, under their theory, the provision is--</text>

            <text syncTime="4595.290" offset="18491541">I don't know the answer to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4596.807" offset="18497602">But if I may just say in conclusion that -- I would like to take half a step back here, that this provision, the Medicaid expansion that we are talking about this afternoon, and the provisions we have talked about yesterday, we have been talking about them in terms of their effect as measures that solve problems, problems in the economic marketplace, that have resulted in millions of people not having health care because they can't afford insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4633.896" offset="18645977">There is an important connection, a profound connection between that problem and liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4642.752" offset="18681399">And I do think it's important that we not lose sight of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4646.621" offset="18696864">That in this population of Medicaid eligible people who will receive health care that they cannot now afford under this Medicaid expansion, there will be millions of people with chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease, and as a result of the health care that they will get, they will be unshackled from the disabilities that those diseases put on them and have the opportunity to enjoy the blessings of liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4676.842" offset="18817759">And the same thing will be true for -- for a husband whose wife is diagnosed with breast cancer and who won't face the prospect of being forced into bankruptcy to try to get care for his wife and face the risk of having to raise his children alone and I can multiply example after example after example.</text>
            <text syncTime="4696.054" offset="18894559">In a very fundamental way this Medicaid expansion, as well as the provisions we discussed yesterday, secure of the blessings of liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4707.612" offset="18940848">And I think that that is important as the Court's considering these issues that that be kept in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4713.182" offset="18963104">The -- the Congress struggled with the issue of how to deal with this profound problem of 40 million people without health care for many years, and it made a judgment, and its judgment is one that is, I think, in conformity with lots of experts thought, was the best complex of options to handle this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4736.814" offset="19057667">Maybe they were right, maybe they weren't, but this is something about which the people of the United States can deliberate and they can vote, and if they think it needs to be changed, they can change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4749.205" offset="19107195">And I would suggest to the Court with profound respect for the Court's obligation to ensure that the Federal Government remains a government of enumerated powers, that this is not a case in any of its aspects that calls that into question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4766.333" offset="19175741">That this was a judgment of policy, that democratically accountable branches of this government made by their best lights, and I would encourage this Court to respect that judgment and ask that the Affordable Care Act, in its entirety, be upheld.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="4787.164" offset="19259019">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="4791.015" offset="19274484">Just a few points in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4792.134" offset="19278872">First of all we talked a lot about the sort of hallmark of coercion, your money or your life, with somebody with a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="4798.538" offset="19304577">I would respectfully suggest that it is equally coercive or certainly not uncoercive if I say your money or your life, and by the way, I have discretion as to whether or not I will shoot the gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="4808.727" offset="19345328">I don't think that eliminates the coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4811.096" offset="19354732">I also don't think this is a discretion that the Secretary would ever be able to exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4815.583" offset="19372704">And the reason is, we disagree on the details, but the Solicitor General and I agree that over the years Congress has had different approaches to expanding Medicare.</text>
            <text syncTime="4823.737" offset="19405305">Sometimes, as in 1972, it makes the expansion voluntary; that's also by the way that happened with the stimulus funds, which were voluntary funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.525" offset="19436443">You didn't lose all your Medicaid funds, which is why 17 States could say no.</text>
            <text syncTime="4835.127" offset="19450862">Sometimes they take the voluntary approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="4837.079" offset="19458699">Sometimes, as in 1984, they take the mandatory approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="4840.365" offset="19471865">If the Secretary exercised the discretion to say you know what, it really isn't reasonable for you to have to give up your funding for the visually impaired and the disabled just to cover these newly eligible people, so we will make it voluntary; we'll make that discretionary -- that would essentially be creating -- converting a 1984 amendment approach to a 1972 amendment approach, and I just don't think that is the kind of discretion that the Secretary has, with all due respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4865.599" offset="19572802">Now moving on to the next point, Justice Alito, your hypothetical I think aptly captures the effect on this, based on the fact that these tax dollars are being taken from the State's tax base, and it's not like Steward Machine, where the Federal Government would say, and oh, by the way, if you don't take the option we are giving you, we are going to have a Federal substitute that will go in and we will take care of the unemployed in your States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4886.762" offset="19657439">Here if you don't take this offer we are giving you, your tax dollars will fund the other 49 States and you will get nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4892.916" offset="19681994">But of course, this situation is much more coercive even than your hypothetical, because it is tied directly to the mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4899.837" offset="19709684">It's also tied to the -- to participation in the preexisting program.</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.372" offset="19723894">So it is as if there was yet another program for post-secondary education; they gave them exactly your option -- option -- and then they also said, oh, and by the way; you not only -- not get these funds, but you lose the post-secondary fund as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="4915.329" offset="19771646">It's really hard to understand tying the preexisting participation in the program as anything other than coercive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4923.269" offset="19803411">The Solicitor General makes a lot of the fact that there are optional benefits under this program.</text>
            <text syncTime="4928.006" offset="19822428">Well, guess what?</text>
            <text syncTime="4929.256" offset="19827444">After the Medicaid expansion there will be a lot less opportunity for the States to exercise those options, because one of the things that the expansion does -- precisely because the expansion is designed to convert Medicaid into a program that satisfies the requirement of the minimum essential cover of the individual mandate, things that used to be voluntary will no longer be voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4949.753" offset="19909364">The perfect example is prescription coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4951.804" offset="19917618">It's a big part of the benefits that some States but not all provide voluntarily now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4956.756" offset="19937367">It will no longer be voluntary after the expansion, because the Federal Government has deemed that prescription drugs to be part of the minimal essential health coverage that everybody in this country must have after the manned date.</text>
            <text syncTime="4969.000" offset="19986372">So that option that the State has is being removed by the expansion itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4973.302" offset="20003613">The Chief Justice made the point--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="4975.404" offset="20011972">Mr. Clement, may I ask one question about the bottom line in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="4978.206" offset="20023153">It sounds to me like everything you said would be to the effect of, if Congress continued to do things on a voluntary basis, so we are getting these new eligibles, and say States, you can have it or not, you can preserve the program as it existed before, you can opt into this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4995.733" offset="20093266">But you are not asking the Court as relief to say, well, that's how we -- we -- that's how we cure the constitutional infirmity; we say this has to be on a voluntary basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5006.273" offset="20135479">Instead, you are arguing that this whole Medicaid addition, that the whole expansion has to be nullified; and moreover, the entire health care act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5024.468" offset="20208204">Instead of having the easy repair, you say that if we accept your position, everything falls.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="5033.692" offset="20245194">--Well, Justice Ginsburg, if we can start with the common ground that there is a need for repair because there is a coercion doctrine and this statute is coercion, then we are into the question of remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5042.798" offset="20281556">And we do think, we do take the position that you describe in the remedy, but we would be certainly happy if we got something here, and we got a recognition that the coercion doctrine exists; this is coercive; and we get the remedy that you suggest in the alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="5055.706" offset="20333174">Let me just finish by saying I certainly appreciate what the Solicitor General says, that when you support a policy, you think that the policy spreads the blessings of liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5064.712" offset="20369223">But I would respectfully suggest that it's a very funny conception of liberty that forces somebody to purchase an insurance policy whether they want it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5073.151" offset="20402973">And it's a very strange conception of federalism that says that we can simply give the States an offer that they can't refuse, and through the spending power which is premised on the notion that Congress can do more because it's voluntary, we can force the States to do whatever we tell them to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5089.660" offset="20469011">That is a direct threat to our federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="5091.829" offset="20477684">Thank you.</text>
