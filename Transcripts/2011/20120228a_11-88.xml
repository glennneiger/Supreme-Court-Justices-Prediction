            <text syncTime="8.856" offset="140773">Unlike the previous case, this case does not involve the need to formulate federal common law or to survey customary international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.860" offset="172747">Here Congress has expressly created the cause of action at issue in a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.513" offset="191346">And we know that in every single other Federal court statute that Congress has ever enacted, it has provided for organizational liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.850" offset="220708">As Justice Kennedy I think you put it earlier, it's a simple concept in our country.</text>

            <text syncTime="39.391" offset="262817">The question arises in this case why did Congress use the word D.C. circuit that gave rise to the TVPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.283" offset="310464">And in that case, Judge Edwards wrote a lengthy concurrence where he again and again used the word individual liability, and individual to describe the PLO which was the very defendant in that case against the backdrop of international law which uses the term individual to differentiate anyone from the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.344" offset="386638">After Nuremberg, starting with the discussions recited most prominently in our reply brief at pages 6 to 8, Professor Jessup and many others discussed whether international law applies simply against states or whether it applies to quote individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.454" offset="447137">The word individual was used again and again to mean anyone but the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.491" offset="463229">And as Professor Jessup and many others said it, includes organizations and juridical persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.562" offset="487575">And this is the usage that Judge Edwards used in his opinion in Tel-Oren.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.697" offset="504084">He uses the word 43 times in that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.982" offset="517250">And if you look at nothing else--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="104.067" stopTime="117.075">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="104.067" offset="521534">I thought you said that Judge Edwards opinion was about politically motivated terrorists, not coming within the Alien Tort Statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_fisher" startTime="117.075" stopTime="156.868">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="117.075" offset="573570">--No.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.908" offset="576913">What Judge Edwards concluded, Justice Ginsburg, was that as he understood the Alien Tort Statute at the time against the backdrop of international law, that any private actor acting under color of law could be held liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.985" offset="629263">And what Judge Edwards decided in that particular case was that the PLO as it then existed was not a state actor.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.139" offset="653818">But the rule that Judge Edwards proscribed and this is at page 793 I believe in his concurrence was that individuals acting under color of law should be held liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.210" offset="694151">That is the precise language that the TVPA uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.129" offset="705854">So if you want to know where Congress got the word individual, and what it probably thought it meant, the best place to look is Judge Edwards' opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="157.502" offset="735320">Congress got it from Judge Edwards.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="169.943" offset="785057">--Well, I think Judge Edwards' opinion was quite prominently read by the Congress then.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.847" offset="804701">It is cited throughout the legislative history in the Senate Report, in the House Report, again and again in the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.401" offset="826853">And this Court I think in Skilling, a couple terms ago, this Court said we have a statute before us dealing with honest services.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.821" offset="852558">And what did Congress mean when it used particular language.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.339" offset="862693">Well, it probably meant what lower court judges had used that language to mean.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="193.825" offset="880561">That is a strange phrase, honest services, as, you know, as a crime, deprivation -- deprivation of honest services.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.914" offset="912953">But the word "individual" is not a strange word at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.985" offset="933224">It's used all the time.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="208.835" offset="940642">It means an individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="210.437" offset="947016">--I think it's a strange -- it's a very strange phrase in the context of a tort statute, because we know that Congress always provides for organizational liability, and it's never used to our knowledge, the word "individual" in a tort statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.911" offset="992992">So it is odd that it appears here.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.750" offset="1028309">And I think Judge Edwards' opinion explains what is going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.718" offset="1040221">Now what my opponents want this Court to do is to look at other places in the U.S. code where the word individual is used outside of international law, outside of tort regimes and we concede often the word individual--</text>

            <text syncTime="246.793" offset="1092466">I look to the TVPA, section 2 (a)(2) which uses the word person.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.014" offset="1113364">So, it wasn't as if in writing the statute Congress forgot the word person.</text>

            <text syncTime="265.923" offset="1168953">So isn't that a textual clue that they were using the word "individual" in a different sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="281.366" offset="1230811">Let me start with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.551" offset="1239483">The argument the other side has is the word--</text>

            <text syncTime="308.866" offset="1340734">They claim, and the D.C. circuit argues that in a state, as we have shown in our brief and this Court has squarely held, only natural people acting as administrator or executor of an estate can bring an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.008" offset="1389322">So the word person refers to natural person.</text>

            <text syncTime="323.276" offset="1398412">You know, it's obvious that individual doesn't usually mean what you want it to mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.162" offset="1413981">Now you have a theory that they all just read Judge Edwards and they came in and used "individual" but it seems actually that we know where individual came from in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.020" offset="1453374">The statute started out by saying person and then there was this moment where one Congressman said, I don't want this to apply to corporations, and the staff member said, I have a great idea to make sure it doesn't apply to corporations, let's change the word person to individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.247" offset="1526308">So that's the way individual got into the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="365.370" offset="1566745">But the question, as this Court has always looked to legislative history is, what does that -- what light does that shed on Congress's understanding of the law to ultimately pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.376" offset="1598824">So two Congresses later, four years later Congress passed the statute with the word individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="817.014" offset="3373374">Why would Congress have done what it did and limit this act, unlike any other tort statute in the U.S. Code, an actual person.</text>

            <text syncTime="826.220" offset="3410154">Justice Ginsburg, you talked about statements legislative history to the effect that individual people who are torturers may be found in the United States, and that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.409" offset="3446935">But the TVPA is a tort statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.861" offset="3456757">Congress already had on the books immigration laws and criminal laws that refuse safe haven to such people.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.531" offset="3483402">The only person of the TVPA is to provide compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.467" offset="3495209">And in every court regime of which we are aware in Federal law -- and they haven't even pointed to anything to the contrary in State law or in international law, the way that you get compensation in tort regimes is you hold agents liable and you hold corporations liable for the acts of their agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.079" offset="3561664">It's absolutely understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.079" offset="3569606">And there is no good reason -- if you think of the three things that a tort statute is supposed to accomplish -- compensation, deterrence and accountability -- on all three of those stands, the TVPA utterly falls flat if it cannot reach organizations, and this is the perfect case that shows you how that is.</text>

            <text syncTime="2092.440" offset="8475088">Isn't it -- if you -- if you look at what happened here, more likely that other than Congressman Lynch -- Leech -- in fact, nobody was focused on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.211" offset="8510092">But because of Congressman Leech's intervention, the words changed, and the word was continued throughout the legislative process.</text>

            <label>Ms. Laura G. Ferguson</label>
            <text syncTime="2112.253" offset="8554291">Well, Representative Yaton was the sponsor of both the bill that was marked up where "person" was changed to "individual", and was also the sponsor of the bill that was ultimately enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.494" offset="8607268">So he was certainly aware that "individual" was selected for this reason of excluding corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.881" offset="8628793">But more importantly, "individual" almost invariably carries the meaning of "natural person".</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.569" offset="8655542">If Congress had wanted the statute to reach nonsovereign organizations, it very easily could have used the term 1983 does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.090" offset="8693681">And the notion that they couldn't use "person" because it would encompass foreign States is not the case when you're dealing with a person to describe a potential class of defendants, because we presume that Congress does not intend to aggregate the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.968" offset="8765152">And the Dictionary Act tells us that "person" is the term Congress uses when it wants to refer to natural persons and artificial persons, but not sovereigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.240" offset="8802246">So if the Congress wanted to do what the Petitioners claim, they had a very useful term that Congress uses all the time to reach that category, and it's the term "person".</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.715" offset="8848117">But instead, they used "individual", and elsewhere in the same sentence, they used "individual" to refer to who shall be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.302" offset="8874553">They used "individual" four more times in a way that can only mean a human being.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.039" offset="8897436">Now granted, there are exceptions to this canon of consistent usage, but they have no fair application here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.043" offset="8925439">Those canons apply when you have a term that has more than one ordinary meaning and you can use them interchangeably without being confusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.482" offset="8963264">Here, the ordinary meaning of individual is to exclude organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.869" offset="8980819">We regularly use individual to mean we're not talking about corporations; we're not talking about organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.606" offset="9007673">So in the same sentence of the statute to use individual to mean -- let's assume we don't normally mean corporations and then immediately just switch and -- and use it to refer to human beings would be very confusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.766" offset="9060335">And yet we see Congress very deliberately and carefully then switch to the broader term "person" when it wanted to sweep in a broader class of potential plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.221" offset="9102131">They wanted to make sure they were sweeping as broadly as possible to allow persons who have wrongful death claims to be able to bring a suit where the victim has died.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.094" offset="9141629">So they use the term "person".</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.196" offset="9150092">And Petitioners' interpretation gives no separate meaning to individual and person, but we assume that when Congress uses those terms distinctly, they intend to give them different meanings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.735" offset="9188231">I would just return to the plain text of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.306" offset="9210487">It's very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.491" offset="9215294">The only situation in which the Court has found that "individual" should be interpreted inconsistent with its ordinary meaning is upon a showing of absurd results.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.847" offset="9252701">Here, there simply is no absurd result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.048" offset="9261478">Congress had every reason to proceed cautiously and incrementally in extending U.S. jurisdiction over conduct that has no nexus to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.921" offset="9300975">And it proceeded by focusing on this Filartiga scenario, ensuring that the United States would not become a safe haven for torturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.910" offset="9332949">I would ask that the Court give the statute its plain-text meaning and affirm the court of appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2387.795" offset="9656450">That of course wasn't clear to Congress when it enacted the TVPA in 1992.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.849" offset="9676721">It wasn't sure whether the ATS was going to be a going concern in light of Judge Bork's opinion in Tel-Oren.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.568" offset="9695529">But rather than amend the ATS, Congress in the TVPA decided to create a separate statute which provided an express right of action both to aliens and to U.S. citizens for two specific norms.</text>

            <text syncTime="2619.160" offset="10581916">To the extent that the legislative history is referring to groups, my friend Mr. Fisher referred to references in the legislative history to groups and organizations that basically are references to things like death squads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.868" offset="10624757">And as a practical matter, even today none of the cases in the Eleventh Circuit that are brought under the TVPA are being brought against death squads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.989" offset="10661224">They -- the case that Petitioners cite in their reply brief, the Drummond case, was not a case where the Columbia paramilitary was a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.927" offset="10692989">The defendants there were actually two corporations and a CEO.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.531" offset="10707408">And so I think as a -- as a practical matter, although it is natural for us to think that if an individual is liable, then so too is the organization that it may have been acting -- that he may have been acting on behalf of; but it is not natural to think that these type of clandestine shadowy organizations that would claim responsibility for such acts -- such heinous acts overseas, would have a jurisdictional presence in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.079" offset="10805629">And I think if you -- as Respondents' counsel already noted, because the TVPA requires state action, the organizational entity here is usually going to be the states, but petitioners acknowledge that no state entity is going to be liable here, and indeed the result here is not that dissimilar to some of this Court's 1983 jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.660" offset="10887967">Petitioners mentioned the question of whether Congress was concerned that the term "person" might pull in something like municipalities, because it could be read to bring in sovereigns, but in -- in the context of municipalities, under Monell this Court has concluded there is no respondeat superior liability, and that superiors or supervisors are not liable for the torts of their agents; they are only liable for their own individual wrongs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.425" offset="10978977">And so I do think that there are policy reasons why Congress could have said something different here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.577" offset="10999562">But -- and they may well be encouraged to do that by 20 years of ATS precedent, that as now for the first time since the TVPA was enacted started to raise the question of whether corporations should be held liable under the other statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.003" offset="11057344">If Congress wants to disagree with the types of policy concerns that were behind this Court's Monell decision, Congress could reach a different result, but we don't -- don't think that that's a decision that ought to be reached through statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.478" offset="11107186">Here, Congress used the term "individual".</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.680" offset="11116068">It spoke about an individual who subjects an individual to torture or extrajudicial killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.150" offset="11137906">It separately referred to "person".</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.918" offset="11145011">And Petitioners' reading of the statute actually gets the relationship between person and individual, which is quite clear as an ordinary question of Federal statutory construction in the Dictionary Act, precisely backwards, because under their reading, "individual" means any nonsovereign natural or artificial person, but "person" can only mean natural person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.014" offset="11225364">And so we think that that is -- is a particularly odd reading of the statute in light of the Dictionary Act, and the statutory structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.020" offset="11261413">If there are no further questions, I would urge the Court to affirm.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="2797.659" offset="11295895">I can make four points, if I may, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.179" offset="11313971">First, when asked again and again why Congress would have done this, I think all I heard was that Congress wanted to adopt an incremental approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.099" offset="11345736">And then Mr. Gannon said, well, maybe we also wanted to have moral accountability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.003" offset="11365276">Well, an incremental approach doesn't make any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.305" offset="11378546">Yes, Congress did so in the context of requiring exhausting a limitations period, so it treaded softly there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.126" offset="11405818">But there are numerous Federal statutes: RICO, the Sherman Act, the Antiterrorism Act, which is quite similar to this act in many ways, that apply to events abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.382" offset="11438837">And they all apply to organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.817" offset="11444584">So if Congress was going to do this, there's no reason to think it wouldn't have wanted to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.885" offset="11460884">Miss Ferguson pointed to the Dorelien case as the one example she could point of where a TVPA judgment was able to be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.791" offset="11492440">And the only reason why that was able to be enforced is because that guy happened to win the Florida Lottery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.193" offset="11510099">He had hidden all of his other assets abroad and won the Florida Lottery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.314" offset="11526504">Is that the statute that Congress meant to pass?</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.864" offset="11536744">We don't think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.932" offset="11541028">Moral accountability was already taken care of in the U.S. Criminal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.084" offset="11557642">There's an express provision of the U.S. Criminal Code that holds torturers liable for torturing abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.305" offset="11578540">And we've cited that in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.555" offset="11583555">I know some of you are going to look at the legislative history, so let me say two quick things about the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.626" offset="11603826">First, Justice Kagan, with respect to Representative Leech's comment, if anyone after that hearing wanted to know what that committee thought the change it had made meant, and what the bill meant, it would have looked at its report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.818" offset="11664535">And if we've cited -- we've cited the committee reports in the Foreign Relations Committee, and it says the TVPA allows liability for any person that commits torture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.822" offset="11692538">It uses the word "person" utterly interchangeably with the word "individual".</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.774" offset="11708420">So that's -- whatever moment happened 4 years before the enactment was long since lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.778" offset="11732453">And the reason it used ultimately the word "individual" and not "person", as I've described before, was to steer clear I think of any possibility of State entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.217" offset="11766203">Mr. Gannon points to Monell, but Monell favors us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.586" offset="11779682">Monell holds that organizations can be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.787" offset="11792430">Now, there's a separate question that you talked about in the earlier argument, too, as to what the mens rea would be, whether it would have to be according to a policy or practice, or whether it would be pure respondeat superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.726" offset="11828166">But Monell is on our side in this case, and we've alleged a policy in our complaint in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.130" offset="11849795">Thirdly, in the U.S. Code, where the word "individual" is used, it obviously means natural persons lots of times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.534" offset="11875395">But when it does, it almost always uses the -- contrasts it in that very sentence with an entity or organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.440" offset="11903085">So in this course, when you say individuals or corporations, yes, you mean a natural person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.609" offset="11923774">But as the United States points out in footnote 3 of its own brief, the word "individual" when it is used alone is a less favored usage that actually gives rise to ambiguity because of the secondary meaning I've described before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.751" offset="11976332">And then finally, let me say the questions are asked about the relationship between this case and the Kiobel case, and I think it's absolutely clear -- and this goes again to one of Justice Kagan's questions on absurdity -- if this Court holds that the Alien Tort Statute would have let a torturer right by Mr. Rahim, someone who's tortured, that is, bring a cause of action, I think it would indeed be absurd to imagine Congress stepping in and passing a statute saying if you're an American citizen, I'm sorry, you're out of luck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.088" offset="12089599">But if you happen to be lucky enough to be an alien and never having tried to be a citizen in this country, go ahead and bring the case in our courts; we think that would be absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.024" offset="12121364">So with those points, if the Court has any further questions around the submissions I've made -- I guess the last thing I would say is, at the end of Mr. Gannon's argument, he referred to the interplay between the word "individual" and "person" in the briefs, and I can assure you from have having worked on this during the case, it is an incredible sideshow as to whether or not estates are people and all the ways that that works.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.688" offset="12204015">But it's laid out in our brief, and we think that it's quite clear that there is no disjoint between the word "individual" and "person".</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.923" offset="12225018">If you look at our brief, it will explain why.</text>
