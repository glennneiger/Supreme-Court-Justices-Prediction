            <text syncTime="416.433" offset="2307281">I mean, I'm sure you've looked at this.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.519" offset="2307176">The most -- one of the more interesting things I've found in these briefs were the references to Wigmore.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.489" offset="2307072">So I went back and read what Wigmore said about scientific evidence, expert evidence, and business records.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.460" offset="2306968">And he certainly concedes and agrees with Justice Scalia, and those opinions are filled with hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.046" offset="2306863">I mean, there is no expert who isn't relying on what his teachers told him in college, which reflect dozens of out-of-court statements given to dozens of people who wrote them up in books.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.419" offset="2306759">So expert opinion is always built on hearsay, almost, and -- and so are business records; they are filled with hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.675" offset="2306654">But Wigmore writes a treatise, doesn't he, where he says exceptions have been recognized since the 17th century or earlier to cover that kind of material?</text>
            <text syncTime="466.233" offset="2306550">So my question for you is why shouldn't we recognize a similar, related kind of exception here?</text>
            <text syncTime="474.756" offset="2306445">We are trying to discover the meaning of "testimonial".</text>
            <text syncTime="478.307" offset="2306341">The difference here is a police lab or a lab that reports to a police lab, the individuals there probably know that there is a fairly good chance that what they say will be used in a criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.417" offset="2306236">They don't know it for sure, but they are controlled by the canons, by accreditation, by tests of reliability, by the fact that they are not normally interested in the results of the trial, as here they couldn't care less; they don't even care if it is used in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.777" offset="2306132">And all the Wigmore factors for both exceptions could support a similar exception here, which would have the following virtue: It would have the virtue of not requiring ten people to come in and testify, whom the defense is of course free to call; and it would also have the virtue of removing the temptation for prosecutors to stop relying on the more reliable evidence, DNA, and instead encourage them to rely on the less reliable evidence, namely the eyewitness testimony in a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.635" offset="2306027">Now, that -- that really is all my questions in one.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.270" offset="2310520">Because I understand every argument you are making -- fitting it in with hearsay, I agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.005" offset="2329433">And I also agree to a degree with the testimonial point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2785.569" offset="11247741">Sandra Lambatos' testimony really has to be analyzed as having two components to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.889" offset="11273028">The first component is the match, the match between the data reflecting the allele charts from Cellmark, and the data that was produced in analyzing Petitioner's blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.114" offset="11321825">As to that component of her testimony, she's a live witness, she's subject to cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.885" offset="11348992">I don't think that anyone asserts there is a Confrontation Clause issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.420" offset="11363098">But as several members of the Court have pointed out, that testimony is entirely irrelevant and nonprobative unless it can be linked to the semen that was taken from the victim and that was subsequently analyzed to generate a DNA profile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.698" offset="11432166">As to that issue, Illinois State law provides that her testimony cannot prove for the truth of the matter asserted what Cellmark did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.022" offset="11481485">She cannot repeat on the witness stand when she gives the basis for her testimony things that Cellmark said and have them be taken for the truth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2879.945" offset="11625159">If you read her testimony -- I give you an example at page 79 -- she tells on cross-examination exactly what the steps were in the Cellmark report, what numbers they gave, and she tells and explains -- she -- the State's attorney took pride in this -- she said I disagree with that number that they came up with.</text>

            <text syncTime="2925.924" offset="11809165">I think, because she clearly did link the DNA that she compared to the blood DNA to the semen that was sent to Cellmark, and I think that several members of the Court raised the question is she implicitly thereby repeating what Cellmark said and then making Cellmark the out-of-court witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.587" offset="11891816">My answer to that is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.637" offset="11899967">First of all, as a matter of Illinois State law, she could not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.674" offset="11920133">She is not permitted to give the basis for her opinion in that respect and have it taken for the truth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2986.895" offset="12053044">There is a shipping manifest that shows that the semen goes out to the lab; there is a shipping manifest that shows that it comes back.</text>
