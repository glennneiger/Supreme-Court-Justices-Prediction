            <text syncTime="7.370" offset="136567">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.689" offset="145762">In its landmark decision in Apprendi, this Court announced as a fundamental principle of Fifth and Sixth Amendment jurisprudence that every fact necessary to increase the punishment beyond that which is otherwise maximally provided for must be presented to the jury and must be decided by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.685" offset="233743">In this particular case, the defendant was fined a total of an $18 million penalty in the context of a jury finding that there was a single day of violation under the RCRA provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.945" offset="294869">Congress is quite explicit that the maximum fine for a single day's violation is $50,000.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="57.837" offset="338441">Yes, I believe the jury trial was constitutionally required, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.990" offset="355055">The cutoff between what's a petty offense not subject to jury trial and what is beyond that, I think you could get there two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.560" offset="385253">This is a crime that Congress attaches a 5-year penalty to if it's against an individual, which suggests that it is a very serious crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.297" offset="416286">And the maximum fine under the district judge's interpretation of this would have been $38 million, even though the judge chose only to impose an $18 million penalty under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.438" offset="460799">So, either way, it seems to me clearly a serious offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="99.460" offset="504894">Does it have to be a substantial fine or do we have a word that we use?</text>

            <text syncTime="102.662" offset="517746">Well, you haven't used the word -- I mean, the distinction is between a serious offense and a petty offense and the places where you have drawn the line to conclude that a fine was too small to be worried about was $10,000 in the Muniz case.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.505" offset="573021">You recognized in Bagwell that $52 million was way beyond what would be appropriate under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.575" offset="597367">I think the Court benefits most if it just focuses on the potential penalties that Congress has adopted and use that as the guidepost, because if Congress has said that this is something for which someone could be punished--</text>

            <text syncTime="134.567" offset="645328">Well, you have to do that because you have to know whether -- whether to impanel a jury before the jury comes in or before the jury comes in with a penalty, right?</text>

            <text syncTime="172.758" offset="798092">So there is no effort whatsoever to limit the -- the individual, or in any way to -- the person or persons or entities that are entitled to those rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="193.588" offset="881370">But no, Your Honor, obviously "peers" in that context is -- is derived from the citizenry in the State or the district in which the prosecution is brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.027" offset="915121">I mean, obviously we don't get corporate peers in that sense, but that -- but no one has ever doubted that an ordinary jury would be a suitable jury of peers for corporations, and candidly, corporations are tried all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.835" offset="966425">And no one has doubted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.787" offset="974157">And I don't think it -- you know, first of all, it seems clear under the language of the Sixth Amendment and Article III that corporations are entitled to a jury, and that no one is -- in anything that is a serious offense, and that clearly is what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.029" offset="1027134">And so what we've got is a decision by the jury that there was at a -- at a single point in time a violation of RCRA.</text>

            <text syncTime="305.845" offset="1330468">That's correct, Justice Scalia, and that therefore, if you apply the core Apprendi doctrine in a principled way, as Justice Kennedy suggested in a separate concurrence, if you applied it in a principled way, you determine what facts are supported by the jury's findings and how far does the penalty take it, and it goes to $50,000, and anything beyond the $50,000 is, if it's found by the judge, it doesn't satisfy the Sixth or Fifth Amendment under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.448" offset="1444884">That should be in my judgment the end of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.400" offset="1456691">The First Circuit rejected that argument by turning to Oregon v. Ice and suggesting that there was a fundamental shift in how the Court applies the Apprendi doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.422" offset="1496711">And I -- I would suggest to you that, although you are clearly better positioned to determine what you thought you meant by Ice than I am, my interpretation of Ice is that it deals with the very different situation of multiple offenses and the very different problem of trying to extend the Apprendi doctrine to the context of multiple convictions, and then adopted a methodology for applying it in those circumstances that focused significantly on a particular history of consecutive versus concurrent sentences--</text>

            <text syncTime="389.416" offset="1664730">But the impression I have is that -- that I had thought there were what I would call the elements of the offense, and then there were sentencing facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.771" offset="1698167">And sentencing facts have been traditionally facts found by the judge when imposing a sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.758" offset="1718125">Now the majority of the Court in Apprendi went back into the history and said there is no significant old tradition, old enough, of -- of sentencing facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.781" offset="1762219">So really when you raise the sentence that's like an element and you should have a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.852" offset="1782490">Now, the argument here, one of them, the government stresses -- and Ice is the same -- is that there is no -- the tradition's different where fines and where multiple and concurrent sentences were at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.778" offset="1838183">If you go back to the 18th century or earlier, what you will discover is that the judge has always had a much greater role in deciding what the amount of a fine should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.050" offset="1879248">And therefore, insofar as that amount rested upon some view of the facts as to the manner in which the crime occurred -- and it always does -- it was the judge who traditionally found it, not the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.393" offset="1932642">So those facts are not like elements of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.612" offset="1945494">That's what I thought was essentially the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.064" offset="1959287">Ice and fines are on one side of that line and Apprendi is on the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="467.016" offset="1975065">I think the -- the problem with that analysis, Justice Breyer, is I don't think the history, first of all, is anywhere near as clear in this context as it was, for instance, in Ice in terms of who decided what.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.824" offset="2022294">It is -- there is no history that suggests that judges had the authority to impose fines beyond whatever the maximum statutory limit that was provided for by the legislature involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="494.468" offset="2084884">They are not doing that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.652" offset="2089690">What they are deciding is a fact of sentencing is how often this crime was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.506" offset="2113096">No one can go against the statutory limit, but rather it allows a higher sentence when certain facts occur.</text>

            <text syncTime="743.644" offset="3081612">So the notion that it could be a -- a significantly shorter period, maybe not, maybe not just a day, ultimately, but clearly you can't -- we just don't know, because no one asked under those circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1800.553" offset="7309269">Because the Court went on several paragraphs later in its opinion to describe what it would mean to adopt a formulaic complication of Apprendi, treating it just as a rule divorced from history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.377" offset="7360574">And one of the consequences that the Court considered was the impact it would have on sentencing accoutrements, two of which are directly related to this case because they are financial penalties, fines and restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.121" offset="7411565">Now, I've talked about how the amicus brief that prompted that paragraph, the concern about implications of expanding Apprendi referred to fine statutes that operate on a gain or loss basis which necessarily requires judicial fact finding after the guilty verdict comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.998" offset="7483036">But if the Court isn't satisfied with those, restitution which is explicitly mentioned in Apprendi -- excuse me, in Ice, classically operates based on findings about victim loss that occur after the guilty verdict has come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.192" offset="7547819">This Court is well familiar that oftentimes courts have to postpone sentencing in order to allow the victim to gather evidence and to present it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.698" offset="7577808">Now the Court could, I suppose, do as the lower courts have done and say restitution is different because it's designed simply to compensate for loss and therefore it's in one sense remedial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.256" offset="7624097">But that will have to deal with the fact that in cases like Pasquantino v. United States and Pennsylvania v. Davenport, the court has described restitution as a criminal penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.146" offset="7671640">Now the other way in which lower courts have said that restitution isn't swept up by Apprendi is to say that it's a rule that has no maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.852" offset="7710405">Whatever the amount of harm to the victim is, that can be compensated through restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.471" offset="7728900">But again, if one is applying an algebraic understanding of the relevant statutory maximum from the Blakeley decision, restitution would be hard to justify because the jury verdict does not contain findings about harm to victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.665" offset="7789713">The jury verdict finds guilt, afterwards the judge finds an additional fact, namely the amount of harm and imposes restitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2259.951" offset="9146827">And for jury trials to do it, there may well be a need for bifurcation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.521" offset="9165112">And this Court in Oregon v. Ice declined to impose on the States the need to bifurcate trials to determine whether a sentence should be run consecutively or concurrently, because that would intrude upon a valuable reform that was designed to provide some restraints on judicial discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.733" offset="9242017">The same kind of thing would operate here if this Court adopts an across-the-board rule that fines have to be proved to a jury.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="3189.969" offset="12866977">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.355" offset="12876485">Hopefully, I'll be able to give you back a couple of those minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.957" offset="12886830">I'd like to -- I'd like to start with what seems to me ultimately the fundamental notion of the United States' position, which is that there is a vast gulf somehow between fines and imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.265" offset="12932074">And it seems to me very difficult within the constitutional structure to embrace that approach when obviously, property interests are protected in the Fifth Amendment; they're protected in the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.972" offset="12982961">And if you go back to Blackstone, where he talks about inflicting corporal punishment or stated imprisonment for a term which is better than an excessive fine, that amounts to imprisonment for life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.530" offset="13021204">There's a recognition historically that fines have an enormous impact on individuals and of course are entitled to fundamental constitutional protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.302" offset="13060283">It seems to me that the government's approach there to saying fines are off the table and it's completely open season on defendants under those circumstances is unjustifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.242" offset="13096019">With respect to restitution, I already suggested to the Court all lower courts have concluded that restitution is not within the Apprendi doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.662" offset="13125694">I don't think that's going to be a problem under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.113" offset="13139486">And -- and I don't think ultimately that the issue in this case is sort of what is or is not the common law tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.786" offset="13170206">Because I -- if I go back and I think -- I read Justice Thomas's concurrence in the history there, he doesn't even mention Tyler as part of -- as part of that analysis, and yet concludes with what I think is a very powerful assessment, that juries would be available for fines up to, you know, within -- if it were going to go beyond some kind of a maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.467" offset="13256933">But within the maximum obviously in that context, the judge would have complete discretion on -- on how to approach it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3292.854" offset="13278458">What about the amount of loss issue that Justice Breyer raised with -- very complicated to determine what the amount of the loss is.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="3301.626" offset="13313566">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.192" offset="13315865">Justice Ginsburg, I think it's worth considering two facts in this case in dealing with what I think is purely a policy argument that shouldn't override the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.381" offset="13352541">But the first one is that -- the notion that Apprendi applies to fines has been well accepted in 99 percent of the country for more than a decade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.654" offset="13389635">And the Antitrust Division operates and makes these kinds of decisions all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.372" offset="13408548">Fraud prosecutions are going forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.391" offset="13416593">The amicus brief that was filed by the Chamber of Commerce demonstrates categorically they -- this -- this -- it's done every day and it gets done effectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.414" offset="13452747">So whatever the problem of Apprendi, it has not surfaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.465" offset="13464868">And -- and you'll look in the government's brief for any specific evidence of the complaint that it makes other than the hypothetical possibility that they were afraid a parade of horribles would be play out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.987" offset="13503006">This Court has rejected that parade of horribles in every other Apprendi context.</text>

            <text syncTime="3352.189" offset="13515754">If -- if -- on the question of the value of goods or the amount of the loss, what would the standard be?</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.279" offset="13548146">Would the jury have to find beyond a reasonable doubt that it is -- the value was such-and-such?</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="3366.116" offset="13571552">Yes, I think that is precisely what the jury would be asked to find.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.301" offset="13584299">And juries are asked to find that all the time and make that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.122" offset="13599555">And I guess the last point that I think as a practical matter that ought -- the Court ought to take notice of is that no State filed an amicus brief in this case, that Apprendi has not been the problem in the fines context that would even warrant anybody to come in here and complain about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.131" offset="13659532">It seems to me the right answer is to apply the core doctrine, the core principle of Apprendi, which even the government concedes if you just take the language, it talks about any fact that increases the penalty, that algorithm takes you to the conclusion that the judgment below should be reversed.</text>
