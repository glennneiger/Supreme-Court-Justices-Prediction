            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="8915">We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 10-507, Pacific Operators Offshore v. Valladolid.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.606" offset="55308">Mr. Clement.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="12.391" offset="58443">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.260" offset="69937">The straightforward question in this case is whether the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provides a remedy for a worker injured in a forklift mishap on dry land.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.798" offset="112046">The answer is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.067" offset="117166">A worker injured on dry land from operations on dry land has a remedy in the State workers' compensation law, but not from OCSLA's extension of the Longshore Act to the outer continental shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.641" offset="171397">Indeed, both the benefits review board and the Ninth Circuit here held that the accident occurred too far inland for direct coverage under the Longshore Act.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="50.849" offset="212252">When you say on land, do you -- where do you put the 3-mile State offshore limit?</text>
            <text syncTime="57.670" offset="239524">Does that count as land under your view?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="59.872" stopTime="102.246">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="59.872" offset="248301">No, it wouldn't count as land, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.323" offset="262198">If there were platforms on there that were themselves treated as land, that might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.394" offset="282469">I think most of the 3 miles from shore is going to be the navigable waters and that might be covered, for example, directly under the Longshore Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.631" offset="315384">But as I say, one of the anomalies here is there was a direct Longshore Act involvement in this case, and the determination was that the facility here was too far inland for direct coverage under the Longshore Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.403" offset="358433">So therefore, the counterintuitive proposition on the other side of the table today is that in extending the Longshore Act to the outer continental shelf, Congress effectively created a boomerang effect that caused the Longshore Act to apply further inland than it otherwise would.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="102.246" offset="417888">Mr. Clement, just to follow up on the Chief Justice's question, if there is a helicopter crash in the water, let's say it occurs 2.5 miles from the shore, is that covered?</text>
            <text syncTime="112.904" offset="460520">And similarly would it be covered if it occurred 3.5 miles from the shore?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="117.339" stopTime="150.762">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="117.339" offset="478179">Well, Justice Kagan, I think the best answer is both of those crashes would be covered directly by the Longshore Act because the Longshore Act by its own terms, not extended by OCSLA, covers the navigable waters, and both of those would be accidents occurring in the navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.282" offset="537947">And in the part of this Court's opinion in the Pacific Operators case addressing the DOSA claim, this Court said that a helicopter effectively when it's performing this kind of ferrying function is a vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.239" offset="581833">So I would think that the right answer there is not that OCSLA extends the Longshore Act, but the Longshore Act applies directly under those circumstances.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="150.762" offset="611926">The curious thing about this case is that the statutory language seems to me to speak quite clearly to some theory of causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.368" offset="646303">Any injury occurring as a result of operations conducted on the outer continental shelf, that's -- that's causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.855" offset="676291">Maybe it's but-for, maybe it's proximate, but it's some -- some species of causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.609" offset="699279">And yet nobody wants this really to be -- neither you nor your adversary nor the government wants this to be a -- to be based on causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.281" offset="737940">Everyone wants to smuggle something else into -- into here -- into this.</text>

            <text syncTime="186.185" offset="753614">Well, Justice Alito, let me talk first about the causation and then about the smuggling if I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.904" offset="772526">As to the causation, I think there is both causation in this 1333(b) and a situs requirement that both sides acknowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.993" offset="808784">At a bare minimum, there has to be injuries resulting from operations conducted on the shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.516" offset="834907">And I think that alone, that causation principle alone, if faithfully applied, is enough to decide this case in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.836" offset="860193">But let me address the smuggling, because I do think--</text>

            <text syncTime="251.961" offset="1016719">I doubt very many go.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.961" offset="1020690">But Congress passed this statute at a time where they didn't know the full scope of the operations that would take place out on the shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.900" offset="1048484">And so what they are trying to do is they are trying to -- at the one point they are trying to limit it to employees who are engaged in the operations out there that are designed for the production of the mineral wealth of the shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.458" offset="1098744">And so I think that's what some of the language is directed at--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="275.576" stopTime="294.122">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="275.576" offset="1111178">But if that -- if that's what Congress meant, then the emphasis should be on is this person one who regularly works on the outer continental shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.699" offset="1147645">The -- this worker we're told was on the outer continental shelf 98 percent of the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="295.157" offset="1189441">And if he was at the -- on the Outer Continental Shelf at the time of this accident, he probably wouldn't have been injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.692" offset="1207622">But the one thing I think the statute clearly speaks to is not status, but it speaks to, as Justice Alito suggested, at a minimum a relationship between the operations that caused the injury and the fact that those operations have to be conducted on the shelf.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.201" offset="1265718">But -- but if you had said status or situs, then it seems to me it would have made more sense, given the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.759" offset="1311903">We all have hypotheticals.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.242" offset="1317859">We have too many, but it -- it's quite common on oil rigs that the employees bring some of the equipment back to the land, clean it, prepare it, and so that they can bring it back to the next -- the next shift on the rig.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.268" offset="1377940">And some of this machinery is complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.636" offset="1387449">It has springs in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.172" offset="1397584">And suppose that the worker brings the machine back from the rig to the land, to the base of operations that is land-based, and is injured in repairing that machine?</text>

            <text syncTime="361.365" offset="1454322">I think that's quite difficult to square with the "as a result" language, because this is a result of the operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.836" offset="1484206">Let's just say the machine got broken because of the -- of the operations, and there -- and he's fixing it and he's injured.</text>

            <text syncTime="375.340" offset="1510224">--No, I disagree, Your Honor, respectfully, and I think your way of looking at that hypothetical doesn't give sufficient import to the phrase "conducted on the shelf".</text>
            <text syncTime="383.695" offset="1543661">It's -- what Respondents want to do is they want you to look at the statute as saying as long as there is an injury that results from operations that have the purpose of developing the outer continental shelf, that that's enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.919" offset="1588487">And if that were enough I think the answer to your hypothetical would be that's covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.771" offset="1603952">But the statute very specifically says that they have to be injuries as a result of operations conducted on the shelf for the purpose of extracting the mineral wealth of the shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.246" offset="1645852">And so that first "on the shelf" I think clearly modifies the operations.</text>

            <text syncTime="516.731" offset="2075828">Now, there is a test where we say that the best reading of the statute is status plus situs.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.502" offset="2098920">And if I try to get this argument out, it's a little bit complicated, because I think the defect of this argument, if it has one, is it doesn't directly leap out directly from 1333(b) you have to read 1333(b) in conjunction with both the rest of 1333 and in conjunction with 903(a) of the Longshoreworkers' Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.463" offset="2170704">If you do that, I think you will see there is a situs requirement and a status requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.265" offset="2185960">Let me start with the rest of the 1333.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.700" offset="2195677">If you think about the statute, the primary engine for applying Federal law to the shelf is not 1333(b), it's 1333(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="554.806" offset="2228069">It applies all the Federal law to the shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.758" offset="2235906">But some statutes, it doesn't work and the longshore Act is one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.294" offset="2250012">If you apply the Longshore Act to the shelf without any modifications, it won't cover the shelf because it by its terms has a situs requirement that is limited to the navigable waters and at that point the drydocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.352" offset="2298286">So Congress has to tailor the Longshore remedy to the reality of the shelf and it does it in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.422" offset="2318557">One, it has this language that everyone's focused on that is something of a status requirement in that it limits the recovery to employees who are engaged in certain activities, but the rest of the language in 1333(b) is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.146" offset="2369444">It's these definitions 1, 2, and 3, and they effectively define terms in the Longshore Act to make them work for purposes of extending it to the shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.252" offset="2405911">And the key definition is 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.954" offset="2412703">3 defines the term "United States" when used in the geographical sense, and it defines it to include the shelf, the artificial islands, and the fixed attachments thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.929" offset="2464530">Now, that's a puzzle if you look at 1333(b) in isolation, because it's defining the term 1333(b) does not use the term "United States" for geographical purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.271" offset="2521999">But another statute does; it's 903.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.640" offset="2531403">It's the Longshore remedy that's extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.606" offset="2539240">And 903(a) uses the term "United States".</text>
            <text syncTime="636.377" offset="2554391">And 903(a) if you want to look at it is at page 96 of the petition appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.662" offset="2567557">But that's the situs requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.512" offset="2574871">The the situs requirement of 903(a) unmodified limits recovery to the navigable waters and drydocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.851" offset="2604233">So if you take that definition from (b)(3) and essentially superimpose it on 903(a), you then get a remedy that has a situs requirement; there's a recovery, but only if the injury occurs on the navigable waters, drydocks, the shelf, artificial islands, and the attachments there to.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.479" offset="2678734">So it's -- as I say, it's a complicated argument and it doesn't stare you in the face if you look at 1333(b)--</text>

            <text syncTime="1211.431" offset="4854629">And it doesn't say it's a product of OCSLA generally; it says particularly that it's a product of OCSLA's extension of the Longshore Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.436" offset="4882633">And I do think that this objection about people moving in and out was answered by the Court in Herb's Welding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1242.302" offset="4978032">They thought long and hard about having an admiralty remedy, and presumably then the Jones Act would apply, and if you were attached to a vessel or a platform then you would have coverage no matter where you went.</text>

            <text syncTime="1260.347" offset="5050234">So when Congress makes a conscious effort to deal with this unusual geographical problem with -- and solves the problem with the Longshore Act, which is sitting there with a situs requirement, and doesn't adopt the Jones Act, which has a status-only requirement, it seems very, very, peculiar to adopt instead a model that would have a status-only test.</text>

            <text syncTime="1299.972" offset="5208745">But they are living in real-time with the experience of people under the Longshore Act, which at that point did carve out and limit the remedy, the federal remedy, only when a State remedy was unavailable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1406.658" offset="5635482">The only way they can say that those functions were performed by the statute anyways is to incorporate provisions of the Longshore Act, because 1333(b) itself doesn't take care of latent injuries, or doesn't take care of, you know, who is in the scope of their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.334" offset="5694205">All of that is taken care of in the Longshore Act, which is why I think the best way to read this is incorporating the Longshore Act and its situs requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1430.956" offset="5732657">Those words do play a function, but the function they play is to make it clear that the injury has to result of operations conducted on the shelf for certain purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1466.814" offset="5876122">And I think what you have to understand is, go back in 1953 and when they -- I mean, you can say confidently that there aren't accountants on the shelf because you have the benefit of 60 -- 60 years of experience with -- post-1953 with what goes on, on the shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.039" offset="5933068">Congress at this point is sort of legislating for a brave new world, and they don't -- they are trying to provide for all of the occasions that may come to pass out on the shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.745" offset="5963893">There is a great law review article that actually provides this background, and it's written by, of all people, Warren Christopher, the Warren Christopher, and it's in the Stanford Law Review, and it was written in December of 1953, and it's worth a look because it captures this idea that they are kind of, you know, legislating for this brave new world out there and they don't know who is going to be out there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1547.951" offset="6200667">I would like to start off with the exchange that Justice Kagan had with Mr. Clement about the language that was used here in 1333(b), and I think the contrast between the language that Congress used in 1333(b) and the language it used in other provisions, neighboring provisions of 1333, is instructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.645" offset="6267436">And I would like the point the Court to section 1333(c), which is on page 3(a) of the appendix to the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.216" offset="6293767">This is the provision involving the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.251" offset="6305888">And I think this shows how Congress went about drafting when it wanted to specify legal consequences that would flow from an actual event that took place in a particular place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.607" offset="6347266">So Congress extends the National Labor Relations Act to any unfair labor practice as defined in such act occurring upon any artificial island.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.880" offset="6384360">And it lists with particularity the particular situses where the National Labor Relations Act would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.449" offset="6406616">If Congress had followed that model in section 1333(b) it would be a very different statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.287" offset="6433993">It would have said, as Your Honor pointed out, with respect to disability or death of an employee resulting from any injury on the outer continental shelf.</text>

            <text syncTime="1628.553" offset="6523122">Congress didn't do either of those things in section 1333(b), and we think that contrast is -- is quite instructive here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1681.187" offset="6733565">So when you are talking about a situs of operations, you are talking about a geographic zone where operations take place, it makes sense that Congress would have used this phrase "on the outer continental shelf".</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.745" offset="6779854">Now, the outer continental shelf itself is a defined term in the statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3416.791" offset="13676076">First of all, Justice Kennedy, you asked about deference, and I think before you give any deference to the government's position you should look at the other government's position which is to say the position that the government took in its brief to this Court in Picket v. Petroleum Helicopters in 2002.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.351" offset="13734277">They have a completely different position now and they've never explained the difference other than to say what they thought was plausible then they now find persuasive now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.707" offset="13763743">That's not enough for deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.940" offset="13768654">And in that brief they took a position very similar to ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.909" offset="13780461">There has to be status plus situs albeit a slightly different situs, but otherwise it's on all fours with our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.729" offset="13803762">Second of all, the government comes up here and says the longshore remedy is an outlier among workers' compensation remedies because it's the only one with a situs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.084" offset="13841170">Well, the problem with that is of all the workers' compensation provisions that Congress could have extended to the Outer Continental Shelf, it picked the Longshore Act with the situs requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.476" offset="13882757">And the government also says, well, you know, the reason that the Longshore Act had a situs requirement was because of Jensen, and this Court's decision in Jensen created a problem about whether State workers' comp law could go to navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.034" offset="13933016">Well, that's the same back drop against which Congress is passing OCSLA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.586" offset="13951197">It doesn't know that State workers' compensation law can go to the Outer Continental Shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.073" offset="13969170">Jensen is still good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.773" offset="13975962">Jensen tells Congress that it can't extend -- they can't extend their laws to the navigable waters.</text>

            <text syncTime="3508.067" offset="14041163">What states overwhelming did is say a worker could be covered in a different state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.053" offset="14057046">But covering them on the Outer Continental Shelf was not something that was well established.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.457" offset="14074704">And indeed Congress specifically heard testimony that questioned the ability of either states to get their workers' comp law there directly and also heard that there might be constitutional problems because of the Knickerbocker Ice case of Congress extending the State law there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.383" offset="14134368">So that's why they settled on this remedy of taking this Longshore Act that solved the Jensen problem on the navigable waters and solved the same problem for the Outer Continental Shelf.</text>

            <text syncTime="3559.084" offset="14245232">But they were solving the exact same kind of jurisdictional problem they saw with the Longshore Act with the shelf -- with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.490" offset="14274802">Justice Sotomayor, I don't think you can read too much into B(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.275" offset="14289953">All b(2) is doing is modifying the same definition for the longshores.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.996" offset="14308866">You are an employer if you employ a longshoreman or a longshore worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.947" offset="14328615">So they are just updating this for purposes of extending a longshore remedy to the shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.451" offset="14350662">B(3) does the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.053" offset="14357036">And it modifies the situs and creates a situs that makes sense for the shelf: the navigable waters, drydocks, the shelf, artificial islands and everything attached thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.277" offset="14401966">Mr. Chief Justice, you talked about the imprecision of their test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.063" offset="14417117">It's worse than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.046" offset="14421088">It's imprecision without any text.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.348" offset="14430283">At least in the Jones Act you have seamen and you have some other textual clues as to where you draw these limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.669" offset="14451495">Here there is nothing in the statute that in any way suggests a status-based test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.204" offset="14469676">So you would be completely unmoored, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.323" offset="14478139">The last point I would make is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.357" offset="14486290">The answer to the causation test is really of the kind of a lie of the other side's position is what they say when they are dealing with somebody who is not a 98 per center but is a 2 per center.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.480" offset="14526832">When that person goes out on the shelf, when are they covered?</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.498" offset="14538848">Well, when the injuries operating on the shelf cause a direct injury on the shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.884" offset="14552432">At that point even the government resorts to a situs-based test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.419" offset="14566538">Well, here's the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.721" offset="14571762">That status-based test, it is in the Jones Act; it's not in OCSLA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.140" offset="14589421">And even when you recognize that and you look at what is left of the case, what is left of the case is either our approach that essentially incorporates the Longshore Act through b(3) or a tight-nexus test that would require a geographical focus and give -- give force to the words "conducted on the shelf".</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.053" offset="14661101">This person was injured by operations for the purpose of exploring the shelf at some level, but he sure wasn't injured by operations conducted on the shelf for those purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.659" offset="14703524">He was injured by operations on dry land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.794" offset="14716063">And under those circumstances, the remedy lies with the State workers' comps law, not with OCSLA.</text>
