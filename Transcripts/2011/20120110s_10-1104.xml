            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Justice Breyer has our opinion this morning in Case 10-1104, Minneci versus Pollard.</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="8.381" offset="138909">A famous case called Bivens versus Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, this Court held that a federal agent’s violation of the Fourth Amendment gives rise to a cause of action for damages against a federal government employee, namely, the one who violated the Fourth Amendment and caused some harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.555" offset="223650">Subsequently, this Court held that a government employee's violation of the Eighth Amendment and sometimes the Fifth Amendment can also give rise to a cause of action for damages against the government employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.402" offset="275059">But the Court has also held in various other circumstances, the Eighth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, the First Amendment do not give rise to a Bivens type action for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.745" offset="316437">Well, the question before us is whether a prisoner can bring a Bivens action for damages when the prisoner seeks to bring an Eighth Amendment claim based upon prison officials' deliberate indifference to the harm caused by their improper medical care, he says that violates the Eighth Amendment, and when the prisoner brings that claim not against a government employee but against a private employee of a private company that manages a federal prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.026" offset="437541">We conclude that in these circumstances, he cannot, not.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.958" offset="457289">We cannot read the Constitution as providing a Bivens remedy in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.749" offset="480381">Our basic reason is that in this kind of case, the prisoner does not really need this kind of federal remedy for a state tort law provides the prisoner with an adequate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.764" offset="528447">In an earlier case, Wilkie v. Robbins, we said that we would decide whether to imply a Bivens action from the Constitution through a two-step test.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.593" offset="571810">The first step, we said, consists of asking whether any alternative existing process for protecting a constitutional interest amounts to a convincing reason for the Judicial Branch to refrain from providing a new and freestanding damage remedy, i.e., the Bivens action.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.075" offset="649759">In this instance, we stop at that first step.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.524" offset="663552">State tort law provides this prisoner with a damage remedy for the kinds of injury that he claims he suffered.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.467" offset="695317">The existence of that remedy in the circumstance should deter constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.746" offset="720394">It should also provide adequate compensation to the victim and we are aware of no special reasons to imply the existence of an additional Bivens remedy and so, we don’t do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.794" offset="768564">We explain our reasons in greater detail in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.089" offset="781730">We discuss the contrary arguments and we leave for a future day, the determination of whether we should imply a Bivens remedy should there arise other First -- Eighth Amendment cases which unlike the cases of the kind before us, state tort law does not provide so adequate a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.019" offset="857485">We reverse the contrary determination by the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.386" offset="870964">Justice Scalia has filed a concurring opinion joined by Justice Thomas, and Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
