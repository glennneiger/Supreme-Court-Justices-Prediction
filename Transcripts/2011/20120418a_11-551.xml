            <text syncTime="19.272" offset="184177">On the one hand, Congress has required the Secretary of the Interior to accept every self-determination contract proposed by an Indian tribe, provided that the contract meets the requirements of the Act, without regard to the total number of contracts into which the Secretary must enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.530" offset="245199">Now, on the other hand, in every fiscal year since 1994, Congress has enacted an explicit statutory cap on the amount of money that the Secretary may use to pay contract support costs under the ISDA and under those contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.851" offset="306535">Now, we think under the circumstances, Congress intended the Secretary to resolve these -- the relationship between these provisions in exactly the way that the Secretary has.</text>

            <text syncTime="3134.775" offset="12646257">Well, I think the question is it's unclear what Congress really wanted in this case, and therefore, you ought to construe the -- the scheme in a way that is most favorable to the tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.069" offset="12695367">And if that means that the scheme operates so as to protect the integrity of the appropriations process and the spending process for a particular year, and prevents us from being able to seek relief outside of this contract support cost appropriation limitation, that makes perfect sense to me, leaving open obviously the availability of the judgment fund at the end of the day so that the tribes do not in fact have to bear the full burden of -- of this arrangement as opposed to -- as opposed to anyone else.</text>

            <text syncTime="3208.924" offset="12942799">Let me explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.392" offset="12944680">As I mentioned earlier, for the first many years in this scheme, we did a uniform pro rata distribution methodology.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.046" offset="12971325">The tribes came to us and said, look, that's a problem for us because we don't have any budget transparency; we can't see how much we're going to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.633" offset="13001627">So we adopted this policy in 2006.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.419" offset="13012807">And one of the principal elements of that policy is that it guarantees that, if -- as long as Congress appropriates as much money as it did in the previous fiscal year, which it generally has, the tribe will get immediately, like within 2 weeks, the exact amount of money that it received in the previous year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.531" offset="13073202">And that money comes immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.497" offset="13081144">They can use it however they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.066" offset="13087413">It's not subject to apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.999" offset="13095145">Unlike most Federal agencies, we don't dole it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.518" offset="13105176">They get it right away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.084" offset="13107475">Now, the question then becomes what to do with any additional money that Congress has appropriated, and the policy provides for distribution of that money on what we call a bottoms-up basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.742" offset="13150107">We give it to the tribes that are the farthest away from 100 percent of funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.360" offset="13164526">That resolution was negotiated with the tribes and, indeed, with some counsel for Respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.781" offset="13190231">It's, we think -- and I might be wrong about this -- but we think that that's the solution that the tribes want, if the caps have any effect.</text>
