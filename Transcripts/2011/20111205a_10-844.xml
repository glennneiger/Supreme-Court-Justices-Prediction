            <text syncTime="27.676" offset="216127">Here, there is no dispute that Novo's patent does not claim the use of repaglinide when used alone, and that is "an approved method" of using the drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.201" offset="274223">Even though that matches the statutory language exactly, Novo is arguing that in this case, our counterclaim to correct their blocking use code is thwarted by the fact that their patent does claim a different approved use--</text>

            <text syncTime="132.054" offset="633668">But the context here is a little bit different, because the context here in the counterclaim is a situation where drugs routinely have multiple and different distinct uses.</text>

            <text syncTime="158.278" offset="738576">But when a judge -- when a judge says to me that, you know, you are going to lose this case because you didn't cite an applicable precedent, I am going to hear that to mean I didn't cite a specific particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.070" offset="793746">There are many ways to use the word "an" after the word "not" where it clearly does not mean "any".</text>
            <text syncTime="177.772" offset="816525">For instance:</text>
            <text syncTime="178.599" offset="819764">"The prosecutor failed to get a conviction because she did not prove an element of the offense. "</text>
            <text syncTime="185.641" offset="847976">"I got lost on my way to the party because I failed to make a turn. "</text>

            <text syncTime="195.059" offset="885697">So the context speaks volumes in terms of whether or not "an" means "any" in any particular context.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.943" offset="1397175">Now, maybe Congress just did a bad job of drafting.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.566" offset="1411699">But the first is the one we were discussing before, and that's the second one, that -- your -- your beef really is not that the patent does not include every use.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.826" offset="1456734">Your beef is that the source -- the use code is too broad, and yet that is not the ground that the statute sets out for seeking deletion or correction.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.763" offset="1612424">And in fact, they haven't identified any meaningful role for the word "correct" in the statute as they read this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.087" offset="1641785">Remember, what they say is there is two pieces of information that qualify as patent information: expiration dates and patent numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.913" offset="1673028">Nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.646" offset="1675954">The correction remedy can never reach an expiration date under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.018" offset="1701449">I haven't heard Novo to argue otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.970" offset="1713256">What they're saying is if a patent is correctly listed in the Orange Book, this counterclaim is unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.621" offset="1743872">So what does that mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="410.713" offset="1748261">If the brand company incorrectly lists the expiration date for a properly listed patent as 2150, this counterclaim is not available to correct the expiration date.</text>

            <text syncTime="1069.607" offset="4383807">Why does the FDA rely on use codes in the Orange Book to make the carve-outs if it doesn't do anything to ensure the accuracy of the code?</text>

            <text syncTime="1082.881" offset="4436992">Well, the statute -- well, let me start with the basic that the statute envisions that there will be carve-outs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.269" offset="4462488">That's the whole principle behind section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.990" offset="4465413">And so FDA says, well, we need to know when a generic has made a valid carve-out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.202" offset="4498223">And FDA says, and FDA goes through this in the 2003 rulemaking -- if you read through the preamble there is more detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.059" offset="4521629">But the short of it is FDA has three choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.515" offset="4523510">It could rely on the generics to say that they've carved out, but that doesn't really work because the generics could say something and then get on the market when they hadn't proper carved out and that kind of defeats the whole point of Hatch-Waxman's principle of getting patent issues resolved before regulatory approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.367" offset="4594876">FDA could, as a second alternative, try to evaluate patents itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.111" offset="4617864">But nowhere else in the statute is FDA given any role in the substantive evaluation of patents, and with good reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.252" offset="4638448">This Court has said in its Markman decision that claim construction of patents is a question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.170" offset="4654122">The actors in our system that decide what patents mean are courts and ultimately this Court; it's not FDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.153" offset="4685991">So the third choice--</text>

            <text syncTime="1169.642" offset="4784003">Now, this may be a very easy case, but the Court shouldn't be fooled that all cases are going to be easy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.673" offset="4804065">And if FDA here were to go in and said, well, this doesn't look like it's the same as the claim of the patents, in the next case, where it's a more difficult question, where there may be some very good faith dispute between the parties about the very meaning of the patent, FDA is going to have to make a decision one way or the other, and it's going to get sued.</text>

            <text syncTime="1237.240" offset="5054422">Well, it seems to me that that challenge would fail because &lt;FDA&gt; [= FDA] has made a reasonable construction of the statute, that its role its role is ministerial, it does not engage in substantive evaluation of patents because the statute doesn't envision that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.263" offset="5110429">So FDA would win that suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.546" offset="5115653">On the other hand, if -- going back to my answer to Justice Kennedy, if we are talking about kind of a second scenario where FDA does engage in substantive patent review, yes, FDA could get sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.807" offset="5160688">But the problem with that is that FDA is going to get sued in an APA suit, the real parties in interest are going to be the generic and the brand, FDA is not going to be owed any deference because it's going to turn on a matter of claim construction, which is a question of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1783.843" offset="7240767">They could do that here but they have chosen not to, and in the exercise of their enforcement discretion said: We are going to accept the ANDA applicant's submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.701" offset="7272218">And, more importantly, FDA has made the policy decision to tie the section viii determination to the use code.</text>

            <text syncTime="3071.344" offset="12390755">And FDA had this extensive rulemaking, that as &lt;Mister&gt; [= Mr.] Hurst said, Congress was aware of.</text>
