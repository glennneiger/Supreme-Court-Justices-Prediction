            <text syncTime="8.939" offset="139160">Section 514 did something unprecedented in American copyright law.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.408" offset="157027">It took millions of works out of the public domain, where they had remained for decades as the common property of all Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.045" offset="183568">That violated the Copyright Clause and the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.346" offset="196733">Let me turn first to the Copyright Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.615" offset="205824">In Eldred, this Court held Congress gets to pick the date on which a copyright expires, and it can extend that date before we reach that date.</text>

            <text syncTime="35.137" offset="243963">You said that Congress can set a time limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.625" offset="265906">In this case, we are dealing with, let's say, Aaron Copeland, who gets the benefit of copyright, and Congress says: No, we think Shostakovich should be treated just like Copeland.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.253" offset="328391">Yes, we took care of our own when we weren't part of the world community, but now we are.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.722" offset="350229">And so all that Congress is doing is giving Shostakovich works the same limited work as Aaron Copeland.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.308" offset="384606">And why does that violate the limited-time prescription?</text>

            <text syncTime="82.718" offset="434239">But the person -- the person we are talking about, the work we are talking about, never got the first limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.622" offset="457853">There was no, there was no time, there was no time when that work could have been protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.276" offset="480528">So why isn't it consistent with the Copyright Clause to say, you are entitled to limited time protection?</text>
            <text syncTime="101.930" offset="511143">We are not talking about a case where you've had the protection, enjoyed it and then it expired, and then Congress says: We'd like -- we like your work so much, we are going to give you another term.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.939" offset="563179">What's affected here are people who were unprotected.</text>

            <text syncTime="124.295" offset="600586">Many of the works that were restored here did get some time, 28 years, and were not renewed.</text>

            <text syncTime="139.555" offset="661608">We are talking about Shostakovich, Stravinski, and I say: Well, what's wrong with giving them the same time that Aaron Copeland got?</text>

            <text syncTime="162.068" offset="751679">--Well, but saying you have no time is itself picking the limit because the language of the Copyright Clause forces Congress to pick a limit that constraints copyright by marking its end.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.656" offset="793997">And when -- If a limit does not mark the end once reached, then there is no limit, there is no end.</text>

            <text syncTime="189.635" offset="861915">It is within Congress's discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.320" offset="868603">Remember, this is permissive.</text>

            <text syncTime="200.009" offset="903398">Every Congress since 1790, every time it went to add subject matter, every time it went to extend the duration of copyright, respected that choice to give no time.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.698" offset="946134">And in fact, the time -- the decision to make foreign authors ineligible is a decision that Congress has never gone back on.</text>

            <text syncTime="1575.679" offset="6406040">It obscures what Section 514 actually does and what Congress is all about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.000" offset="6431326">Since 1891, Congress has concluded as a matter of copyright law that foreign works are entitled to the same protection as domestic works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.307" offset="6472600">The problem with respect to the authors that Section 514 covers is not that Congress set the copyright limit at zero, it's that as a matter of foreign relations, we did not have treaties with these individual countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.131" offset="6523904">And what 514 does is remedy that be problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.599" offset="6541772">What 514 says is: With respect to a defined set of foreign authors, they get the remainder of the copyright term that they would otherwise have gotten, and nothing more, had they lived in countries where we had -- with which we had copyright relations at the time they published, or had they complied with the formalities that we used to enforce but no longer do to perfect and renew copyrights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1721.183" offset="6988152">Well, one limit I think is a quite important one is that the Copyright Clause says that you can only grant copyright in authors, to authors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.825" offset="7030680">And as a work gets older and older when you're talking about Shakespeare and Ben Johnson, there really at that point isn't an author in which you could vest the copyright.</text>

            <text syncTime="2981.448" offset="12029158">Of the 10 states with copyright statutes, you had seven that did not provide copyright to maps and charts, which the Federal statute did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.537" offset="12061550">And I think this is the key point: Of the states that did enact copyright statutes to -- in the 1780s in advance of the 1790 Federal Act -- at least four, and depending on how you counted -- as many as eight provided copyright protection only to works printed after the date of the State statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.902" offset="12150993">They did that at the urging of the Continental Congress in 1783.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.521" offset="12169488">So I don't think there is any doubt that when Congress enacted the Copyright Act of 1790, it made a conscious choice to take a different approach, to grant copyright protection to existing works, including many, many, many works that were freely available for exploitation in those states.</text>

            <text syncTime="3038.387" offset="12256946">Doesn't that show at most that retroactive protection can be granted when there is an enormous interest in doing so, namely, the establishment of the uniform copyright system at the beginning of the country, because if Congress had not done that and had said the alternative would be to say things can be copyrighted going forward, then you would have different copyright laws in all of the States?</text>

            <text syncTime="3063.252" offset="12356420">I think -- I don't think so, Justice Alito.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.304" offset="12368541">I think they could have followed the model nationally of prospective copyright only, and extinguishing the prior copyright, but they didn't make that choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.743" offset="12406366">They made a different choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.928" offset="12411068">Now, my friend suggests that the 1790 Act was just a transition, but of course, the same thing is really true in an important sense of section 514.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.784" offset="12450461">It's part of a tradition of a transition of the United States into the international system, which has required an adjustment of our rules in order to bring us into conformity with the international system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.806" offset="12490585">And beyond the example of course of the 1790 -- and by the way, with respect to that language in the 1790 copyright who have or have not copyright, that's just a rerun of an argument that the Court rejected in Wheaton v. Peters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.399" offset="12548995">In Wheaton, the Court said that -- that language in the 1790 Act was referring to pre-publication common law copyright, not post-publication common law copyright.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.540" offset="12589537">Beyond that, it seems to me pretty clear that what that language is referring to -- of course, Congress presupposes the existence of copyrights, or at least State statutes that created some copyrights -- but what Congress did was act far more broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.015" offset="12635408">And -- so I do think -- and then when one looks at the examples of patents -- I think the -- the Oliver Evans example, and that case, is an important example, early in our history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.703" offset="12682219">Congress creates a new patent term to an expired patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.274" offset="12700505">President Jefferson signs it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.392" offset="12708968">Secretary of State Madison issues it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.678" offset="12718059">Chief Justice Marshall upholds it as a circuit justice, and the Court upholds it against a charge that it's impermissibly burdening people who act in reliance on the expiration of the prior patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.252" offset="12776364">There wasn't a word in this Court's decision in that case about any potential constitutional infirmity with doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.342" offset="12804786">And one would think if this was such a significant and viable principle of constitutional law, that someone would have brought it up in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.947" offset="12839163">In fact, the striking thing about reading the Evans decision is that the Court clearly looks at this all as a matter of legislative policy judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.569" offset="12881690">It says, you know yes, you're right, it might have been an argument, a good argument in favor of creating some reliance interest here, but that's a judgment Congress should have made if anybody was going to make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.341" offset="12924740">It didn't -- and there is no reading of the -- there is no required reading of that statute that has to protect the reliance party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.131" offset="12959848">So I don't -- I just think when you look at the patent protection, when you look at the 1790 Act, when you consider the fact that when Congress expands exclusive rights, as it did for example with respect to musical compositions but did in the 1976 Act with respect to lots of exclusive rights, it does so with existing copyrights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.408" offset="13032991">And all of that points up to the wisdom of what this court said in Eldred, that within very wide margins, these are matters where legislative choice, these are policy calls that require the balancing of a complex set of interests, the drawing of a complex set of lines made even more complex by virtue of the fact that we are now trying to make a transition into full participation in an international system, which is of vital importance to protecting one of our most valuable economic exports, intellectual property.</text>

            <text syncTime="3282.508" offset="13233403">The point of the limited times restriction is it -- excuse me -- it forces Congress to tell us when the end has come, and if Congress is forever free to change its mind, then we can never know if the end has come.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.149" offset="13275930">Point number two, this statute does not and cannot promote progress, that is, the creation and spread of knowledge and learning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.737" offset="13306337">When we joined Berne in 1988 we got all of its prospective benefits, or as the government put it, secured the highest available level of multilateral copyright protection for U.S. artists, authors and their creators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.812" offset="13354611">This statute is not about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.979" offset="13363284">It's simply about rewarding people who made things long ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="3370.211" offset="13584175">The problem here is -- the -- the -- the right to use works in the public domain has defined the freedom of speech that the public has known since 1790.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.436" offset="13629106">The 1790 Act made these freedoms clear by placing works unambiguously and clearly in the public domain, including all foreign works.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.441" offset="13657109">So even since before we had a First Amendment, that has defined the freedom of speech that the public knew.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.862" offset="13682813">And that right has also made sure that the copyright sequence provides ever-increasing protection for public speech rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.932" offset="13711130">It gives partial protection for some public speech interests during any initial period of protection, but that blossoms into complete protection for all public speech interests, once we reach the limit Congress picks, once they place the work in the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.759" offset="13766405">The burden on speech that this statute imposes is remarkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.913" offset="13786990">Let's start with the performance right, which is central to my clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.413" offset="13797021">There can't be any doubt, as I think Chief Justice Roberts got at, that the performance has a huge amount of original expression bound up in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3438.089" offset="13855744">Hume amount of expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.541" offset="13861491">But even if you put performances aside, this Court has recognized in case after case that there is a critical speech interest in publishing the work of another author, in showing a film created by another, or for that matter performing the work of another, so that the burden here is it took speech rights of 250 million Americans and turned them into the private property of foreign authors, all on the bare possibility that might put more money in the pocket of some U.S. authors.</text>
