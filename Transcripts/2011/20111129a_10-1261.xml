            <text syncTime="11.389" offset="150925">Justice Scalia, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.674" offset="160120">In section 16(b) of the 1934 Exchange Act, Congress created a cause of action to allow securities issuers to recover short-swing profits from certain covered persons, but specified that a lawsuit must be brought 2 years after the date the short-swing profit was realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.921" offset="241100">The statute doesn't say 2 years after the date the defendants filed a section 16(a) report, as the Ninth Circuit and Respondents would like to have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.027" offset="277567">Nor does the statute say 2 years after the date the plaintiff discovers the short-swing transaction, as the government would like to rewrite it.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.766" offset="308496">I would like to make two basic points here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.401" offset="319049">First, as this Court recognized in Lampf, the 2-year time limit in section 16(b) is best read as a period of repose that can't be extended at all; and second, even if section 16(b)'s 2-year time limit could be extended, the doctrine of equitable tolling wouldn't apply to extend the time limit here, where the plaintiff didn't act diligently to bring a claim and didn't prove that any extraordinary circumstances precluded her from filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.152" offset="433988">The upshot of these two points is that this Court should reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision and remand the case with directions to dismiss the complaint as untimely.</text>

            <text syncTime="91.760" offset="472440">On your first -- on your first point, you cite Lampf, but Lampf had two limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.530" offset="503578">So it said -- what was it, 1 year from whatever -- from discovery?</text>
            <text syncTime="106.519" offset="531477">And then it set an outer limit at 3 years, and it was the same thing in Merck.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.504" offset="551434">Here we just say -- it just has what seems to me a plain vanilla statute of limitations that is traditionally subject to equitable tolling.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.064" offset="601694">We don't have that special kind of a statute that gives you one limit and then sets up a further limit that will be an outer limit.</text>

            <label>Mr. Christopher Landau</label>
            <text syncTime="132.920" offset="637116">Your Honor, with respect, it's certainly true that a two-pronged time limit underscores that the outer prong is a period of repose, but there are certainly no magic words that Congress has to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.641" offset="679957">It doesn't have to use a two-pronged time limit to -- to establish the outer limit as a period of repose.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.779" offset="700541">In fact, that's really the lesson of this Court's decision in TRW and in Beggerly and Brockamp, that the -- the background or the default rule, the background rule that equitable tolling applies, isn't some kind -- is just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.122" offset="761877">It's a background rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.391" offset="766997">And Congress in the text or structure--</text>

            <text syncTime="170.209" offset="786223">You don't have the two-pronged structure, which really did, as Justice Ginsburg said, drive the analysis when we -- when we talked about those provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.565" offset="823630">So that's not there.</text>

            <text syncTime="186.570" offset="851738">--The key point, Your Honor, is that this Congress in the 1934 Exchange Act was carefully attuned to the issue of time limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.741" offset="880368">Congress -- there was -- there was a lot of discussion of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.510" offset="891444">This is a not a situation where Congress established a liability and just didn't focus on this issue, as often happens, and left it to background statute of limitations provisions of other background rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.716" offset="928329">Congress thought long and hard about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.234" offset="938360">With respect to the two-prong provisions, those are the fraud provisions that were set at an outer limit of 3 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.322" offset="962706">And then they actually created a discovery rule that said: We don't even want people to wait the whole 3 years; if they discover the facts underlying their claim, we want them to bring it within a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.362" offset="1006905">So they used discovery to shorten the time, not to extend it.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.766" offset="1028535">But I guess I'm still not understanding why, if you look at this provision, you would think of this as anything other than an ordinary statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.186" offset="1058210">What is it about this provisions -- or, I don't mean to -- to -- I mean, you can -- you can make structural arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.440" offset="1083183">But -- but you know, what factors do you think in this provision makes it a statute of repose?</text>

            <text syncTime="252.696" offset="1116202">First, I would like to just finish on the structural point; and we also have a textual argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.498" offset="1131457">With respect to the structure, this, let's not forget, was enacted at the same time and as part of the same statute as these other provisions that did use discovery provisions to shorten the time limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.455" offset="1175239">What Congress did with respect to 16(b), instead of having the 3-year outer limit plus a safety valve that would make you have to sue even sooner, Congress has brought in the outer limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.411" offset="1215049">But -- instead of 3 years as in the 2-prong provisions, said you have got to sue within 2 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.232" offset="1234380">Having said you have got to sue within 2 years, they decided you didn't need that safety valve provision.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="287.753" offset="1256427">The problem is it reads like dozens of statutes of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.588" offset="1271787">It says: No suit more than 2 years; and that I think there's the general understanding that that limitation, that kind of limitation, there is a presumption that it is subject to equitable tolling, forfeiture, waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.299" offset="1346602">And why, if this one doesn't use any different words -- why--</text>

            <text syncTime="317.255" offset="1374396">This legislation -- again, this section 16 is not a standalone statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.626" offset="1395921">It was enacted as part of the '34 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.559" offset="1403653">And so I think -- the same Congress that set a hard outer limit of repose for fraud claims in section 9(e) and 18(c) wouldn't have wanted with respect to this prophylactic provision that it is, by definition, both under and over-inclusive.</text>

            <text syncTime="341.371" offset="1470945">Well, I could turn the argument around on you.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.706" offset="1480244">Congress surely knew how to write a statute of repose, because it did it in this statute, but it didn't do it with respect to these kinds of violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.459" offset="1511278">This statute of limitations, I'm going to call it, reads very differently from the two-pronged positions that we've interpreted in the past.</text>

            <text syncTime="359.579" offset="1543774">--Again, Your Honor, I think one point, just to respond to that, and as well to Justice Ginsburg's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.933" offset="1561119">The -- the typical textual hook for a statute of repose is that it's keyed off of the defendant's conduct -- 2 years after the defendant does X, Y, or Z.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.360" offset="1618902">That is as we quoted Black's Law Dictionary for this proposition in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.412" offset="1635098">The Seventh Circuit, Justice Posner, had an opinion just last week underscoring this point, the Hy-Vee case, that said the typical statute of limitations actually says 2 years after the cause of action accrued or after the plaintiff discovered, but when you're -- when -- again, we don't think -- in this case we are not relying solely on the textual thing, but in terms of numbers of guideposts this is not your classic statute of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.360" offset="1726840">If you actually start looking at them, a lot of them key off of accrual.</text>

            <text syncTime="431.911" offset="1833106">Congress -- again, I think the most we can say is that the classic formulation of a statute of repose is to key a time limit off of the defendant's conduct as opposed to the accrual.</text>

            <text syncTime="1000.091" offset="4105759">o let's look at what equitable tolling consists of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.627" offset="4115895">This Court in many cases over the years -- it's been dealing with equitable tolling since almost the first days of the Court, well into the 19th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.446" offset="4143167">In the most recent cases, the Court has made clear, in the Holland case, for instance, just two terms ago, that equitable tolling traditionally has two minimum requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.217" offset="4174305">First, there has to be diligence on the part of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.671" offset="4188097">And in this context that means does a reasonable -- did the plaintiff know or would a reasonably diligent shareholder have reason to know of the claim; and second, extraordinary circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.229" offset="4234386">And so, with respect to the Second Circuit's decision in Litzler, Your Honor, that you mentioned, I think it departs from traditional equitable tolling in -- in a couple of ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.852" offset="4276809">Most particularly it limits it to actual knowledge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1052.573" offset="4315679">The second thing with respect to Litzler where it departs from the background rule is it says that it is -- per se gives rise to equitable tolling not to file the section 16(a) and doesn't include any kind of culpability on the defendant's part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.102" offset="4381821">And Judge Jacobs, in footnote 5 of Litzler, dropped a footnote saying that he would prefer to announce a tolling rule that was more consonant with, again, background rules of equitable tolling, that said only when the failure to file the Section 16(a) was unreasonable or -- or intentional, because he could say otherwise you could have a purely technical or inadvertent violation that would give rise potentially to equitable tolling, and he didn't think that was right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1179.640" offset="4824022">First, if you look at their complaint, it's -- it alleges lock-up as its theory of group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.146" offset="4850040">It says the plaintiffs and the -- the underwriters and the issuer insiders formed a 16(a) group because they had these lock-up agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.835" offset="4884731">Well, those lock-up agreements were publicly known as early as the prospectus of these IPOs, so the -- the lock-up agreement was no secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.441" offset="4919212">Second, they say, well, we -- even though lock-up might have been out there, we didn't know there was an underpricing-based conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.695" offset="4944185">And even assuming they could try and slice and dice it like that according to the -- the legal theory, the fact is in their motion to dismiss in the district court, they cited -- this is docket 58 in the district court, pages 1 to 2 -- they -- they go at length about the academic literature regarding a conspiracy between underwriters and issuer insiders that they say gives legitimacy to their substantive claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.560" offset="5039689">But that includes lots of articles, including a 2004 article -- again, 2005 would be 2 years before they filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.980" offset="5065289">So they are relying in their opposition to our motion to dismiss on an article -- there is a lengthy footnote that says there is a ton of academic research on this particular theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.102" offset="5105831">So basically, a remand is unnecessary because the -- the pleaded facts by the plaintiff themselves show this is untimely as a matter of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1262.143" offset="5154001">Justice Scalia, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.336" offset="5210739">I'd like to start where Justices Ginsburg and Kagan did, because if you picked up this statute it would look for all intents and purposes like an ordinary statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.092" offset="5245743">And the question then is, how has Congress rebutted that presumption of equitable tolling either as a matter of text, context or structure?</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.879" offset="5276985">And as I understand it, Petitioners have two basic arguments, both of which are incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.832" offset="5292763">The first is textual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.166" offset="5298092">They say, well, it runs from the time of the complained-of event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.051" offset="5309586">But the reason they can't put too much weight on that, Justice Alito, is because if they looked through the statutes and the Court's cases, they would come across cases like Exploration Company, or Delaware State College, where the statute ran from the time of the complained-of event and this Court treated it as an ordinary statute of limitations subject to applicable for tolling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.913" offset="5377087">And they'd come across Beggerly, which ran from accrual, and yet the Court said statute of repose, not subject to equitable tolling.</text>

            <text syncTime="1379.136" offset="5622011">But Congress could have written the statute to say the time limit shall not be tolled.</text>

            <text syncTime="1385.390" offset="5646984">Now, most of those statutes say there shall be no tolling except in particular circumstances, because Congress has considered it more finely.</text>

            <text syncTime="1428.834" offset="5820750">I think that the statute in Beggerly was an example where the Court said, even though it runs from accrual, it incorporates a discovery rule and it sets a 12-year limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.942" offset="5865159">So textually and contextually -- I mean, I don't think there is any classic formulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.594" offset="5879787">I think that's why Petitioners can't point you to anything, because the courts always look to all the indicia of statutory meaning: Text, context and structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.000" offset="5909462">So the same language can create a statute of limitations or repose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.885" offset="5924927">So in Lampf and Merck, if those statutes hadn't had a two-tiered structure, just the language of the outer prong of the statute alone, I think the Court would have treated it as a statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.007" offset="5961498">The Court didn't say in Lampf that language creates a statute of repose, full stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.711" offset="5980306">It drew a structural inference by looking at both of the prongs and comparing them to each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.265" offset="5998488">So when Petitioners say, whoa, but they've borrowed the language of the outer limit and we know that's repose, well, we only know it's repose in the two-pronged provisions because of their structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.288" offset="6034536">And this provision doesn't have that structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.421" offset="6043105">So I don't think I can point you to any classic formulation, because the same words can be either limitation or repose, depending on what else Congress does in that statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1927.222" offset="7814311">The underwriters argument and the government's for that matter are founded on the notion that Congress wanted someone who violated 16a to receive the benefit of the statute of limitations or repose in 16b.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.062" offset="7869691">16b is unique in the securities law and perhaps in the law generally, in that the plaintiff suffers no injury and recovers no damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1966.030" offset="7969583">As a matter of logic, it makes no sense to provide the one who violates 16b an escape liability because they also violate 16a.</text>

            <text syncTime="1991.662" offset="8072088">And you want to say no, it doesn't begin to run from that point, it begins to run from the point when some other completely different external event occurs, if it ever does occur, which is the filing of the 16a report.</text>

            <text syncTime="2827.050" offset="11413671">The underwriters contended in the lower courts for a subjective rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.921" offset="11429136">No party before this Court contends for a subjective rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.373" offset="11442928">We do not believe that -- Whittaker is not a subjective rule, and I do not believe that Judge Jacobs in Litzler was arguing for a subjective rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.996" offset="11485456">What he envisioned -- he -- the judge had a fair concern in the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.900" offset="11509070">He said look, if they don't file the form but the identical information is available to all the world everywhere else, what's wrong with that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.904" offset="11537074">Well, there's nothing wrong with it, except that it's never available to all the world anywhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.890" offset="11561002">No other securities filings reveal this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.109" offset="11573854">Congress told us to go look in one place, and not anywhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.677" offset="11592140">But the Litzler court I don't think envisioned an actual notice rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.645" offset="11608022">When it said information as clear as 2 plus 2, I believe it was seeking an objective rule, Whittaker-like, looking for Whittaker acquittal and information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.870" offset="11652848">We don't believe such a thing exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.020" offset="11657550">That said, the Litzler rule requires discovery in trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.123" offset="11689942">If the rules don't achieve different results, then we have the choice between applying a rule that is just speedy and efficient -- Whittaker, and a rule that a just, slow and costly -- Litzler.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.968" offset="11753263">Some version of Ockham's Razor, if nothing else, ought to support the application of the Whittaker rule and not the Litzler should the Court find itself in that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.341" offset="11794745">Here's the last thing I'd say and then I will be quiet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.643" offset="11808016">Today is the first time this Court has analyzed the issue before it, but it's come up repeatedly in the lower courts over the last 77 years and with one exception, 1954 in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, the courts have unanimously rejected the petition -- the position contended for by both the underwriters here and the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.793" offset="11912610">The rule has been Whittaker or a Litzler variant of it everywhere, all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.447" offset="11939255">In 1934 the purchase or sale of a stock required the actual knowledge of some other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.684" offset="11964123">Today it is an impersonal electronic transaction, often at home in the middle of the night, invisible to everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.790" offset="11996620">Insider trading was hard enough to uncover then, it's gotten harder now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.077" offset="12013756">We do not believe that Congress envisioned that any additional burden would be placed on a shareholder by forcing to learn this undetectable conduct within 2 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.383" offset="12054925">The most, in our view, famous pronouncement by this Court with respect to the interpretation of 16(b) is out of the Reliance Electric opinion in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.376" offset="12110932">In Reliance the Court said, faced with a question, two competing interpretations of the statute, the Court should -- should select that interpretation that best serves the congressional purpose of curbing short-swing speculation by insiders.</text>

            <text syncTime="3144.932" offset="12685103">The Reliance Electric court concluded if -- if you have a choice, you should select that interpretation that best serves the goal of short-swing trading by insiders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.126" offset="12745916">We believe the -- the case before the Court can and should be determined based on the wording of 16(b) itself.</text>

          <turn speaker="christopher_landau" startTime="3193.614" stopTime="3454.713">
            <label>Mr. Christopher Landau</label>
            <text syncTime="3193.614" offset="12879872">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.282" offset="12886559">Very briefly, just on repose, two quick points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.234" offset="12898367">If there is any one theme that runs through this Court's 16(b) jurisprudence, it's that precisely because the -- Section 16(b) is prophylactic, it should be interpreted in a literal and mechanical way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.540" offset="12943611">I think the -- that argues for repose, because you don't get into a lot of these questions about who knew what when.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.629" offset="12975898">And, so, that certainly would be consistent with -- this case would fit well within that -- that tradition, if you were to go that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.383" offset="13002961">In addition on repose, let's not forget that Congress gave 2 years after the date the profits were realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.287" offset="13030546">If those profits were in a report, you wouldn't need the whole 2 years, anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.941" offset="13049145">In fact, for the fraud provision, you only get 1 year after you discover it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.658" offset="13068058">So in a sense, I think that helps show that even in a repose approach, 2 years is plenty of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.148" offset="13093972">Then -- but assuming that you go with equitable tolling, I think -- I would like to emphasize that there is really four approaches that have been brought forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.752" offset="13124378">There's the Ninth Circuit's rigid approach that it -- they call it equitable tolling, but there's really nothing equitable about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.239" offset="13150396">It's -- it's we don't care about who knew what, when or anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.441" offset="13163144">It is you have to file the 16(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.460" offset="13171294">The district court actually struggled, because the district court in this case said I'm supposed to be doing something called equitable tolling, and there's nothing equitable here at all, because I think everything here was plainly known to the -- to the plaintiffs or should have been known.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.600" offset="13219777">Then you have the Litzler approach, which looks to actual knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.337" offset="13238794">And I think as some of the questioning brought out, there is no background rule that distinguishes between actual knowledge and constructive knowledge for purposes of equitable tolling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.027" offset="13277560">Again, I think as some of the questions brought out, equitable tolling, because it is an equitable doctrine, looks to has the defendant behaved equitably and has the plaintiff behaved equitably?</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.049" offset="13309639">We agree with the government, that diligence, in other words, would a reasonable shareholder -- did a reasonable shareholder know or would a reasonable shareholder should have known is a critical part of the inquiry that's missing in -- in the Ninth Circuit's analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.457" offset="13363242">Where we disagree with the government is with respect to their -- their view of fraudulent concealment to involve any violation -- any alleged violation of a statutory 16(a) duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.014" offset="13413501">Under the government's view, it would be considered fraudulent concealment and would -- we give rise to tolling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.666" offset="13432101">If somebody were to come in today and say, gee, the Microsoft IPO back in 1986, there was actually a group in there, the underwriters conspired, and -- you know, the thing is the difference between this case and that one is this case happens to have involved this hugely prominent IPO litigation that really brought all these things to light, but the -- the defendant in that Microsoft hypothetical would not have the advantage of being able to point to the defendant's -- the plaintiffs' lack of diligence saying this is all out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.020" offset="13553518">So, you would be creating a regime, if you go with the government's approach that really waters down the defendant's culpability on the fraudulent concealment side of equitable tolling, essentially they are asking you to take the fraud out of fraudulent concealment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.613" offset="13611823">The only last point I would like to make is that with respect to the specific facts here again, counsel said today that this was not known until a Harvard symposium in 2009.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.636" offset="13647976">I would urge you, again, to look at their briefing below, their docket 58 in the district court responds to our motion to dismiss by citing a 2004 article, that they actually included in the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.561" offset="13699699">You can look at joint appendix 80 to 83, their theory of underwriter conspiracy with issuer insiders is set forth right there on those pages of that 2004 article, well before the 2 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.018" offset="13745465">And again in addition, the 2000 -- their complaint, which talks about lock-up, you can look specifically at joint appendix 59 to 61 to see how lock-up was alleged to be a critical part of their underlying theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.528" offset="13807532">Finally, it is not true again that the IPO litigation was only about underwriters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.432" offset="13831147">There were individual issuer defendants at issue in the IPO litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.736" offset="13848388">And, in fact, Judge Scheindlin's opinion goes into some detail about the -- the alleged conspiracy that they are saying -- the alleged group that they are saying they couldn't have found out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.357" offset="13886840">In fact, she says -- this at pages 356 and 358 of the Judge Scheindlin opinion, we will provide quotations that show that their theory was very well known.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.447" offset="13919232">Thank you.</text>
