            <text syncTime="300.054" offset="1305642">And at the time, at the Federal sentencing, the Federal judge did not have the complete information to make the proper judgment in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="340.198" offset="1466243">I thought the sentencing judge's reasoning was that the -- the undischarged term of imprisonment that was going to be imposed on the offense for which probation had previously been granted and there had been a violation of the probation, that that had nothing to do with his subsequent Federal drug charges, and therefore the Federal drug charges should run consecutively to that, but should be concurrent to any sentence imposed by the State court on the State drug charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.586" offset="1595810">What -- you know, what's wrong with that reasoning, and what additional insight relevant to that reasoning would be obtained by waiting until after the sentence was imposed?</text>

            <text syncTime="401.771" offset="1712525">And in making the judgment on whether those terms should run concurrently or consecutively, Your Honor, 3584(b) directs the Court to look at the factors of 3553(a) in making that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.031" offset="1769576">And it would be impossible to make that determination under 3553(a) whether the sentence is adequate to deter, whether that sentence protects the public, without knowing what that State term of--</text>

            <text syncTime="1922.750" offset="7796443">But you just can't do that where the State court hasn't yet acted, because -- at least you can't do it in the consecutive case, because the State court judge sees what you did and he may decide: I don't want it to be conservative.</text>

            <text syncTime="3509.628" offset="14143885">On the other hand, sentencing by an administrator without any of those salutary procedural protections, without direct review in the courts, and based on factors that determine to which prison someone should go, not how long they must stay there for purposes of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.287" offset="14206579">And for that reason alone, if for none other, the Court should affirm the judgment because it allows district judges, subject to their wise exercise and sound exercise of discretion, to make these sentences to clarify things upfront for everyone: the defendant, the State courts and the Bureau of Prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.499" offset="14275438">20 years, this country has had half of the circuits following this practice, and there is not one case cited on the other side showing that any mal-administration of justice has resulted, any lack of clarity, any problems with respect to how these sentences are enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.460" offset="14343252">And that's because it does the opposite.</text>

            <text syncTime="3609.143" offset="14541991">Justice Breyer, if I can go back to your hypothetical, I think that the way that the Federal judge can get this accomplished is simply by waiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.713" offset="14576264">After -- after the conviction, Your Honor, they can send the State prisoner back down to State court, allow for that State sentence to be imposed, and then he can come back into Federal custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.390" offset="14631016">And in that situation, that is when the Court has the authority to issue this binding order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.044" offset="14653586">That is the -- because it has all of the information.</text>

            <text syncTime="3642.864" offset="14676888">That's preferable, to clog the judicial system with untold number of Federal convictions that have not been reduced to judgment?</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.522" offset="14723490">That's preferable to giving judges, or recognizing their power to state their views up front?</text>

            <text syncTime="3674.936" offset="14805201">Could you tell me what facts would affect the sentence here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.954" offset="14821188">The judge here very clearly believed that some of the State charges overlapped and some didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.261" offset="14862461">And so it ran some consecutive to one set of State charges and concurrent to the other.</text>
