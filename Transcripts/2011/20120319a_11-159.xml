            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="108273">We will hear argument first this morning in Case 11-159, Astrue v. Capato.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.654" offset="134813">Mr. Miller.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eric_d_miller" startTime="7.537" stopTime="111.987">
            <label>Mr. Eric D. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="7.537" offset="138366">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="10.106" offset="148606">The Social Security Administration has reasonably interpreted the Social Security Act to provide that as a general rule, a person seeking to establish eligibility or child survivor benefits must show that he or she would have been able to inherit personal property from the decedent under applicable State intestacy law.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.750" offset="223212">That interpretation is supported by the text, structure and history of the act, and it comports with principles of federalism because it defers to State law on the determination of family status, which is a traditional subject of State regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.160" offset="276815">It's reasonable and entitled to deference under Chevron.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.529" offset="290294">Now, the textual arguments in this case involve the interaction of three provisions of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.349" offset="313595">The first is section 402(d)(1), which is the basic benefits-granting provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.670" offset="334911">And that says that under certain conditions, the child of a wage earner is entitled to benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.906" offset="359884">And that provision has a cross-reference to a definition of 416(e) of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.227" offset="385171">And 416(e), which is reprinted at page 4A of the appendix to our brief, says that the term "child" means: One, the child or legally adopted child of an individual; two, a stepchild under certain cases; and three, a person who is the grandchild or step-grandchild of an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.391" offset="469808">Now, I think the one thing that's immediately apparent from looking at that provision is that under anyone's reading it's a little bit confusing because it uses the word "child" twice to mean two different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.366" offset="509723">That is, the first "child" is broader than the second, because the first one includes the second as well as adopted child, stepchild, and so forth.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric D. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="145.144" offset="688818">--There -- there are two alternative mechanisms that Congress added to the statute in the 1960s to allow children who lack intestacy rights to establish their eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.250" offset="733226">Those are 416(h)(2)(B) and 416(h)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="161.754" offset="755274">And 416(h)(3) says that an applicant who is the son or a daughter of an insured individual but is not a child under paragraph A, which is the reference to State intestacy law, shall nevertheless be deemed to be a child if there was an acknowledgment in writing that the child was -- that the applicant was the son or daughter, or there was a court decree for support.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.269" offset="849315">But I think--</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="187.471" offset="858092">Those are -- those are obviously meant to deal with -- with children whose parents are not married.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric D. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="193.208" offset="881080">--That -- that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.708" offset="887035">And -- and the reason for that is that in fact, under the law of every State, both in 1939 and today, children whose parents are married do have State -- do have intestacy rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.633" offset="930712">But I -- I think what -- what the provision I just referred to illustrates is that the term "child" in this statute is a legal term of art, because if you were just looking at the ordinary meaning of the word "child", the concept of an applicant who is a son or daughter but is not a child, would be completely nonsensical.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="224.228" stopTime="259.568">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="224.228" offset="1005109">Maybe it means something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.012" offset="1008244">Maybe it means that to the Congress that initially enacted the predecessor of this provision a child was a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.916" offset="1039904">They knew what a child was.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.802" offset="1043457">And the type of child that I mentioned earlier was a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.289" offset="1065400">There wasn't a need for any definition of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.141" offset="1076789">And they -- they never had any inkling about the situation that has arisen in this case, just as they had no inkling that any State would go off and take away intestacy rights for children born to married people during the course of their marriage.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="eric_d_miller" startTime="259.568" stopTime="282.199">
            <label>Mr. Eric D. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="259.568" offset="1146484">Well, I mean -- I think -- I think those -- those are probably accurate factual claims about what Congress was thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.606" offset="1174696">But had -- had Congress wanted -- the way that Congress chose to make sure that the children of married parents could establish their eligibility was by looking to State intestacy law, because Congress knew that under State intestacy law, those children had such rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="282.199" offset="1236972">But isn't there something sort of bizarre about your reading, because Congress in the (e) section sets up very specific definitions about stepchildren and grandchildren and even step-grandchildren in which State intestacy law is not referenced, but you are that saying that as to the largest category, the category in which 90 percent of people are going to get benefits, there Congress sent us all off to State law.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.974" offset="1384093">Well, suppose I'm not so convinced that (h) is as clear as you think it is because there are two sentences of -- of section (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="325.795" offset="1411365">I'm just asking you to provide a reason why Congress would have specified everything about what -- how you get benefits for stepchildren and grandchildren and stepchildren, but not for the main category of people at issue.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eric D. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="342.924" offset="1479911">--Well, I think -- I think it's because with respect to the main category of people at issue the question Congress was asking is, what is the class of people who are likely to have a sufficiently close relationship to the insured person such that it would be appropriate to provide benefits to replace the loss of support that they would likely be getting during the person's life.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.520" offset="1566324">And if you look at what is the body of law that defines that class of people who have a close relationship with someone, it's State intestacy law.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.359" offset="1601641">And State intestacy law sets out sort of a clear, easy to apply rules for the distribution of estates.</text>

            <text syncTime="395.955" offset="1692025">It says:</text>
            <text syncTime="396.390" offset="1693801">"Applicants who according to State law would have the same status relative to taking intestate personal property as a child shall be deemed such. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1165.302" offset="4769458">I mean, "grandchild" is not expressly defined in the act, but somebody who qualifies either under State law or you could also qualify as a stepchild or adopted child of someone who qualifies as a child in that same sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1198.756" offset="4903205">I mean, the run of cases that Congress was concerned about involved children, and for -- in explaining to the agency how to deal with those cases, Congress gave explicit guidance and that's to look to State law in 416(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.052" offset="4972377">Now, Respondent makes much of the fact that the benefits-granting provision, 402(d), has an express cross-reference to the definition in 416(e), but doesn't cross-reference the definition in 416(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.377" offset="5029742">And I think there are two problems with that argument, the first of which is that 416(h) by its own terms says that it applies for purposes of this subchapter, that is throughout all of the parts of the act that we are talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.971" offset="5084077">So effectively 416(h) incorporates itself into the 416(e) definition and there is no need for an express cross-reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.791" offset="5115424">The second point about that is that the structure of the definitions here is very similar to the structure of the definitions used in defining other family relationships that are eligible for benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.318" offset="5173520">So under 402, some of the other subsections of 402, there are benefits for the wife or husband or widow or widower of an insured person.</text>

            <text syncTime="2319.633" offset="9386758">Congress set up a series of proxies to establish whether or not the applicant for child benefits was in fact the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.620" offset="9410686">The principal one of those was the marital relationship because in 1939, as I think Justice Scalia's question suggested, there was a very strong virtually per se conclusive presumption that a child born in marriage was the biological natural child of both of the father and mother of the married couple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.213" offset="9473066">And so the existence of the marriage was a way of establishing in 1939 dispositively that the child was the child of the parents, the child of the survivor -- of the insured whose eligibility for benefits are being invoked here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2410.440" offset="9749964">For parents -- children who do not fall into that category there was this additive provision of section (h) which provided a mechanism for doing it and establishing that State intestacy law would recognize this child as the child of, typically it was going to be the attorney that was contested -- the child of the father -- each established a mechanism for doing that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3456.402" offset="13933840">I would point to (h)(2)(B) and (h)(3), both of which are -- are the exceptions to allow people to qualify when they can't establish State intestacy rights, and both of which refer to someone who is the son or daughter of the insured person but is not, and is not deemed to be, the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.780" offset="14007297">So if biological parentage were -- were what was determinative under (e), and if you only looked at (h) when there was some question about biological parentage, it would -- the idea of someone who is a son or daughter but isn't a child would make no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.992" offset="14072185">And so to give effect to those meanings -- to give effect to those provisions, to give them meaning, 416(h) has to have broader application than just in cases of disputed biological parentage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.067" offset="14128505">It is in fact the gateway through which everyone has to pass, and that's how the -- the agency has -- has so regarded it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.888" offset="14155777">The final point I would make is simply that even if the statute were silent on whether to look to State law, it would be appropriate for the Court to hesitate, I think, before creating what in effect is a body of Federal common law about parental status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.017" offset="14224322">Here, of course, there is an the express textual command the other way, and it would be particularly inappropriate to create as Respondents are urging, a Federal rule that goes well beyond what any State would allow in the context--</text>

            <text syncTime="3562.988" offset="14360159">Because it says what you are looking for under State law is to determine whether someone has the same status relative to taking intestate personal property as a child.</text>

            <text syncTime="3571.760" offset="14395267">--I -- I think the answer to that is the one suggested by Justice Kagan a few minutes ago, and that is that you have to read the first and second sentences together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.902" offset="14439780">And the first sentence sets up a general rule that you are looking to State law, and then the second is about people who would have the same status as children under State law, so that the basic background definition in -- in either case is coming from State law.</text>
