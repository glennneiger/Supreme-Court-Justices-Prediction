            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">The second case on these issues is Lafler versus Cooper.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.550" offset="127624">Respondent Anthony Cooper was charged with five crimes, including assault with intent to murder and all of those crimes arose out of a single incident where he shot and wounded the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.734" offset="176316">Before trial, the prosecution offered to dismiss two of the charges and to recommend a sentence of 51 to 85 months imprisonment, and that would all be in return for Cooperâ€™s guilty plea to two other charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.979" offset="237338">Cooper ultimately rejected the plea offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.698" offset="252176">He now alleges that his attorney convinced him wrongly that the prosecution would be unable to establish the intent to murder the victim because the shots had hit her below the waist.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.070" offset="301704">The prosecution made a second and less favorable plea offer on the first day of trial, and Cooper again rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.708" offset="332215">The -- they went to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.358" offset="338902">Cooper was convicted by a jury on all counts and received a mandatory minimum sentence of 185 to 365 months imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.319" offset="382683">It's substantially higher than what he would have received had he accepted the plea bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.764" offset="404522">After the admission in the Court's denied relief on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, respondent filed a petition for federal habeas relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.934" offset="437123">The Federal District Court found respondent's counsel had been ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.360" offset="450811">It granted a conditional writ, ordering specific performance of the original plea agreement containing the 51 to 85 months sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.906" offset="481008">The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.513" offset="491457">This Court granted certiorari and for the reasons set forth, the Court now vacates the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.852" offset="516848">As the Court makes clear today in Frye, the case just announced, defendants have a right to effective assistance of counsels during the plea bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.125" offset="553942">This case comes here with a concession by all parties that respondent's attorneys -- the respondent's attorney, his performance was deficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.592" offset="587797">Today, the Court holds that for a defendant who claims that ineffective assistance led him to turn down a plea officer -- offer and as a result, receives a more severe sentence after trial, the defendant must show the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.005" offset="645475">He must show that but for the ineffective assistance there is a reasonable probability that he would have accepted the plea and that the prosecutor would not have withdrawn it.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.965" offset="681315">He must show that the court would have accepted the plea and he must show that the conviction and sentence under the plea would have been less severe than none of the judgment and sentence imposed after the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.281" offset="722589">The petitioner and the Solicitor General of the United States, as amicus, propose a more narrow view of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.339" offset="750801">They contend they cannot be prejudiced under Strickland one arising out of -- of -- out of plea negotiations if the defendant is later convicted at a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.969" offset="789253">The Court rejects this view.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.223" offset="798344">First, that contention ignores the fact that the Sixth Amendment does not protect just the trial itself, it applies to all critical stages of the criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.889" offset="837005">This Court has not said that errors occurring before trial are always remedied by an otherwise fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.751" offset="860411">Here, as a result of ineffective advice, respondent went to trial and received a sentence three-and-a-half times more severe that he would have received by pleading guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.097" offset="897818">Second, while defendants have no constitutional right to accept the plea offer and no right that a judge accept the plea, when their offer is in fact made they do have the right to effective assistance of counsel when considering it.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.814" offset="948705">Third, the Sixth Amendment is concerned not only with the reliability of the conviction, but also with the fairness and the regularity of the processes that preceded it.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.043" offset="989560">A blanket rule that a trial wipes clean any deficient performance during the plea bargaining process is inconsistent with the reality of the plea bargaining process and with Sixth Amendment principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.683" offset="1032192">Those principles are consistent with the test that has been adopted by appellate courts now for over 30 years without demonstrated difficulties or systemic disruptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.672" offset="1080153">There remains the question of an appropriate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.776" offset="1092483">The Court discusses this question in more detail and in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.916" offset="1109096">In circumstances like this case, the proper remedy may be for the judge to require the prosecution to re-offer the plea and then to exercise discretion in deciding whether to vacate the conviction from trial or lead the conviction undisturbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.625" offset="1163954">As a remedy here, the state court should exercise its discretion in determining whether to sentence respondent pursuant to the plea agreement, vacate only some of the convictions from trial or leave the convictions and sentence from the trial undisturbed and these matters should be explored in further state proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.730" offset="1224349">Therefore, the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.171" offset="1238141">The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.858" offset="1252874">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Thomas joins and the Chief Justice joins except as to Part IV. Justice Alito has also filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
