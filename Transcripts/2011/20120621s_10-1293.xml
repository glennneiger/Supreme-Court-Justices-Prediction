            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">Justice Kennedy has our opinion this morning in case, 10-1293, FCC versus Fox Television.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="7.081" stopTime="364.695">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="7.081" offset="132765">There are two broadcasters in this case, both of them are respondents, one is Fox Television Stations Inc. and the other is ABC.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.391" offset="181979">They have been involved in a lengthy dispute with the Federal Communications Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.956" offset="200265">The dispute arises from two broadcasts by Fox and one by ABC and the case had been here once before.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.203" offset="229209">The opinion describes some detail of the procedural history.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.467" offset="246241">The two incidents on Fox were broadcast of the Billboard Music Awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.636" offset="270900">The first broadcast was in 2002, the second in 2003.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.556" offset="286574">In the first, an award recipient used a vulgar word.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.627" offset="302874">In the second, the announcer used the vulgarity a couple of times.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.025" offset="320533">The incident on ABC concerned a 2003 broadcast episode of the series called NYPD Blue, and it had a shower scene that included about seven seconds of adult nudity.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.257" offset="381450">The question is whether these broadcasts were in violation of a federal statute, 18 U. S. C. 1464 and that statute prohibits indecent broadcast and the FCC has authority to enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.668" offset="439024">In 1978, this Court in FCC versus Pacifica Foundation upheld the FCC's first enforcement action under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.839" offset="479775">That was the case that involved a radio broadcast of a monologue called Seven Dirty Words, and the monologue repeated the vulgar words a number of times.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.587" offset="522721">It was aired during the daytime broadcast hours when children were more at risk of being exposed to it and this Court in the Pacifica case noted that it was not deciding, not deciding whether an occasional expletive would violate the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.145" offset="592938">Now, it's the occasional or fleeting or passing reference problem that is involved in today's cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.831" offset="623762">Since the 1978 Pacifica case, the FCC has issued various policy statements or rulings on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.294" offset="657617">In 2001, before the Fox and ABC broadcast, the FCC said that the fleeting expletive would tend to weigh against the finding of indecency, but then after the Fox and ABC broadcast took place but before the FCC had issued notices of liability to those broadcasters, the FCC issued a ruling in another case and that's the so-called Golden Globes broadcast case.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.896" offset="771929">In there, the FCC held that use of a specific word could make the broadcaster liable even if the word were not repeated and even if it was a so-called fleeting or passing reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.784" offset="823547">The FCC applied this Golden Globes ruling in interpretation to the Fox and ABC broadcast here.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.640" offset="850923">Fox was found to be in violation, but it received no momentary sanction and ABC was fined over $1 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.254" offset="889375">When these cases came to this Court three years ago, Fox argued that it was arbitrary and capricious for the FCC to change its policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.974" offset="920304">And this Court disagreed and returned the case to the Court of Appeals and this Court noted it was not considering the constitutional arguments including First Amendment questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.611" offset="962832">On remand, the Court of Appeals ruled that the FCC's indecency policy was unconstitutional because it was vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.116" offset="996895">That Court invalidated the policy in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.414" offset="1014032">Having done so, the Court of Appeals reversed the FCC's sanctions against Fox and relied on that ruling to reverse the liability finding against ABC for the NYPD Blue episode.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.384" offset="1053947">On certiorari, the case is now returned here.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.124" offset="1068889">The broadcasters argue that the FCC policies and indeed this Court's holding in Pacifica are an unconstitutional restriction of protected speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.391" offset="1109953">This Court does not reach the First Amendment question however because a basic due process concept of fair notice is controlling here.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.820" offset="1155720">These broadcasters did not have fair notice of the FCC policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.322" offset="1173692">In sanctioning these broadcasters, the FCC applied the new standard contained in the 2004 Golden Globes order, an order that was issued after these broadcasts took place, and it's a fundamental principle of due process that laws must give fair notice of the conduct that is forbidden or required.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.985" offset="1248298">The FCC gave no such notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.611" offset="1254881">It applied the policy announced after the sanctioned broadcast so the FCC orders against Fox and ABC must be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.109" offset="1288840">It's necessary to make three observations about the scope of this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.880" offset="1307961">First, because the Court resolves this case under the Due Process Clause, it does not address the First Amendment implication of the FCC's policy and we do not address the respondents' arguments that we should reconsider our holding in Pacifica at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.844" offset="1363759">Second, because we rule that ABC and Fox lacked notice under the FCC's policies in existence in 2001, unlike the Second Circuit, we have no need to address the constitutionality of the current indecency policy as expressed in the 2004 Golden Globes order.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.212" offset="1437215">Third, this decision leaves the FCC free to modify its current indecency policy in light of its determination of the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.280" offset="1469503">It leaves courts free to review the current policy or any future policy in light of its content and application.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.440" offset="1494162">The judgments of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit are vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.060" offset="1512657">The cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.036" offset="1528539">Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.324" offset="1541705">Justice Sotomayor took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.</text>
