            <text syncTime="10.947" offset="147205">In Arizona almost all State and Federal claims for relief from a criminal conviction are raisable in the Arizona Court of Appeals on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.051" offset="211571">However, a claim that trial counsel was ineffective must be presented first to a trial court in what Arizona labels a post-conviction relief proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.669" offset="274056">Petitioner agrees entirely with Arizona's requirement that ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims go initially to a trial court, and he does not object to the label "post-conviction relief" as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.912" offset="346990">The issue in the case has to do with Arizona's insistence that Petitioner had no right to counsel with respect to the post-conviction first-tier review, portion of first-tier review, even though he did have a right to counsel in the appeal portion of direct review.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.743" offset="474363">And our position is that that distinction between what are two portions of the first opportunity for review of a conviction, broken up sensibly but by dictate of the State into two parts, that that distinction cannot stand, especially in a case in which the first post-conviction proceeding started and ended before anything of substance happened in this--</text>

            <text syncTime="137.334" offset="652727">I mean, this Court has said it makes sense to have the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel looked at by a trial judge first, not an appellate judge, and yet in 2255 proceedings, if you are urging ineffective assistance of counsel, you don't get an automatic right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.616" offset="765785">In 2255 proceedings, counsel will be appointed only if the court determines that the interests of justice so require.</text>

            <text syncTime="3224.933" offset="13003107">Just as he could raise that point in habeas, because it's his first chance to do it, so he could raise the point that the lawyer, the first time that he had the chance to raise the ineffectiveness of trial counsel, was incompetent, et cetera.</text>

            <text syncTime="3256.687" offset="13130167">This Court's been clear in three different cases -- that is only cause if he had a constitutional right to counsel in a proceeding that he's pointed to and that he complains about.</text>

            <text syncTime="3299.340" offset="13300694">Discretionary appeal, we said the likelihood is they could do it on discretionary appeal because they would have a record from below, they would have competent counsel below who would make the best arguments possible, they could then pursue their discretionary appeals because they had something to work with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.379" offset="13380838">But if your first chance is to present ineffective assistance of counsel claim is a post-conviction proceeding, you have no record to work with.</text>

            <text syncTime="3392.156" offset="13671946">The question is did the State act arbitrarily when it takes an ineffectiveness claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="3403.715" offset="13718235">The State would say there is a good reason for it, the Fourth Amendment exclusion claims are disfavored, they have nothing to do with innocence; they involve a kind of fact-intensive inquiry that is better done in a different proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.523" offset="13765465">So I think that the State would have many good reasons, but, you know, it's also true that there, you don't get a lawyer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3422.880" offset="13794931">--Justice Kagan, I just -- I think the Court's case law would -- I mean, I think it would be a different question; the Court having said that under Stone, at least in the Federal system, the Fourth Amendment claims can't be raised on habeas because it would be difficult for a State to come in and say they have to be raised in habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.890" offset="13854908">Here, the Court said in Massaro these claims are best suited to resolution in habeas, and they are claims that are traditionally brought in habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.513" offset="13877373">And at least for that type of claim, which is the -- I mean, the State's not trying to hide the ball here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.885" offset="13894928">All the State has done was take a claim that this Court has said belongs in habeas and say we are putting it in habeas, not in a Federal system where although people can raise it as a practical matter, they're all decided on collateral review -- virtually all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.410" offset="13944978">It says, we are just going to say people have trouble briefing and raising it and we will relocate it to collateral review, not for ambiguous or arbitrary reasons but for all of the reasons that this Court gave in Massaro.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.455" offset="13985207">So at least for that type of claim, I think it's permissible under the Fourteenth Amendment leaving for another day whether they could do it with other types of claims -- that I do think probably belong to a direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.028" offset="14023450">And that would present very different constitutional problems if a State started trying to channel them to collateral review, but -- all Arizona has done is pick up on Massaro and say absolutely right, these claims belong in habeas, and that's where we are going to put them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3521.428" offset="14189066">But it's a very different matter to say that when States go beyond what the Constitution requires in providing counsel, that counsel's performance thereby gives rise to a due process claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.955" offset="14227205">And again, the courts rejected that in at least three cases, and I think saying that it's cause to excuse a procedural default here without saying that there is some underlying right to counsel would require a ruling in those other cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3556.629" offset="14329919">This is not in the record, and I am doing this for my friend's benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.158" offset="14351966">Harriet Levitt was initially appointed to represent Mr. Martinez on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.576" offset="14389687">She then moved to have herself appointed for purposes of a post-conviction review, and it was at a later date, not too much later, that she filed the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.478" offset="14437334">So at the time the notice was filed, she was officially appointed counsel for purposes of post-conviction proceedings, and the Arizona Court of Appeals stayed their proceedings, which were ongoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.832" offset="14494699">There was a notice of appeal to allow it to continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.361" offset="14508805">The other point that I wanted to get to was, the questions about other States where this -- these claims are handled on direct appeal illustrate a couple of things about our argument: One is, it would be -- seem very peculiar to say you have a right to appointed and effective counsel in Wisconsin or Utah on these issues, but not in Arizona, where the label -- that difference is purely label.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.768" offset="14666480">All these claims, almost all of them, require additional evidence, and that fact makes counsel even more important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.654" offset="14698036">Respondents want to say you have a right to counsel on review for almost all claims, but not the one where you need it the most.</text>
