            <text syncTime="52.799" offset="321159">If you do not have the individual mandate to force people into the market then community rating and guaranteed-issue will cause the cost of premiums to skyrocket.</text>

            <text syncTime="110.654" offset="552499">Why shouldn't we let Congress do that, if in fact, the economists prove, some of the economists prove right, that prices will spiral?</text>
            <text syncTime="121.629" offset="596489">What's wrong with leaving it to -- in the hands of the people who should be fixing this, not us?</text>

            <text syncTime="131.151" offset="634524">First of all, I think that it's very relevant here that Congress had before it as examples some of the States that had tried to impose guaranteed-issue and community rating and did not impose an individual mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.476" offset="683843">And Congress rejected that model.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.410" offset="691575">So your question is quite right in the saying that it's not impossible to have guaranteed-issue and community-rating without an individual mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.248" offset="718952">But it's a model that Congress looked at and specifically rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.116" offset="734416">And then, of course, there is Congress's own finding, and their finding, of course, this is (i), which is &lt;43{a}of&gt; [= 43(a)of] the government's brief in the appendix, Congress specifically found that having the individual mandate is essential to the operation of guaranteed-issue and community-rating.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.430" offset="811634">The exchanges, the State exchanges are information -- gathering facilities that tell insurers what the various policies actually mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.837" offset="861267">And that has proven to be a cost saver in many of the States who have tried it.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.325" offset="887285">So why should we be striking down a cost saver when if what your argument is, was, that Congress was concerned about costs rising?</text>

            <text syncTime="238.854" offset="1065335">The question is really, what task do you want to give Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.391" offset="1079546">Do you want to give Congress the task of fixing the statute after something has been taken out, especially a provision at the heart, or do you want to give Congress the task of fixing health care?</text>
            <text syncTime="253.114" offset="1122387">And I think it would be better in this situation--</text>

            <text syncTime="281.433" offset="1235654">So if you, if you strike down only the individual mandate, Congress could say the next day: Well, that's the last thing we ever wanted to do so we will strike down the rest of the statute immediately and then try to fix the problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="357.380" offset="1539405">Now how can you square that reality with the proposition that what we're looking for here is what would this Congress have wanted?</text>

            <text syncTime="572.171" offset="2398625">Because the vision of the exchanges was that if you got out of this current situation where health insurance is basically individualized price based on individualized underwriting and you provide community ratings, then it's going to be very easy for people to say okay, well this is a silver policy and this is a bronze policy and this is a gold policy and we can, you know, I can just pick which insurer provides what I think is going to be the best service based on those comparable provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="635.761" offset="2652953">And the first part of it, which I think actually very much supports our point is where the majority rejects the approach of the dissent, which actually would have required nothing in the statute to have been struck, not a single word.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.653" offset="2696525">But nonetheless this Court said, well, if you do that then all of the sentencing is basically going to be done by a combination of the juries and the prosecutors and the judges are going to be cut out.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.092" offset="2738321">And the Court said the one thing we know is that's not the manner in which Congress thought that this should operate.</text>

            <text syncTime="747.002" offset="3097975">One, I do think there are some provisions that I would identify as being at the periphery of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.055" offset="3118142">And I'll admit that the case for severing those is perhaps the strongest.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.523" offset="3136009">But I do think it is fundamentally different, because if we were here arguing that some provision on the periphery of the statute, like the Biosimilars Act or some of the provisions that you've mentioned was unconstitutional, I think you'd strike it down and you wouldn't even think hard about severability.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.950" offset="3193688">What makes this different is that the provisions that have constitutional difficulties or are tied at the hip to those provisions that have the constitutional difficulty are the very heart of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.423" offset="3235588">And then if you look at how they are textually interconnected to the exchanges, which are then connected to the tax credits, which are also connected to the employer mandates, which is also connected to some of the revenue offsets, which is also connected to Medicaid, if you follow that through what you end up with at the end of that process is just sort of a hollow shell.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.452" offset="3307791">And at that point I think there is a strong argument for not -- I mean, you can't possibly think that Congress would have passed that hollow shell without the heart of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1111.422" offset="4555608">A great example I think which sort of proves, and maybe is a segue to get to my broader point, is a case that involves a State statute, not a Federal statute, but I don't think anything turns on that, is Randall against Sorrell, where this Court struck down various provisions of the Vermont campaign finance law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.031" offset="4614018">But there were other contribution provisions that were not touched by the theory that the Court used to strike down the contribution limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.785" offset="4641081">But this Court at the end of the opinion said: There is no way to think that the Vermont legislator would have wanted these handful of provisions there on the contribution side, so we will strike down the whole thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.907" offset="4681518">And if I could make the broader point, I mean, I think the reason it makes sense in the democracy with separation of powers to in some cases sever the whole thing is because sometimes a half a loaf is worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.548" offset="4728121">And a great example, if I dare say so, is Buckley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.583" offset="4740241">In Buckley this Court looked at a statute that tried to, in a coherent way, strike down limits on contributions and closely related expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.272" offset="4775036">This Court struck down the ban on expenditures, left the contribution ban in place, and for 4 decades Congress has tried to fix what's left of the statute, largely unsuccessfully, whereas it would have I think worked much better from a democratic and separation of powers standpoint if the Court would have said: Look, expenditures are -- you can't limit expenditures under the Constitution; the contribution provision is joined at the hip.</text>

            <text syncTime="3242.761" offset="13080930">There was a -- there was -- a shifting of present actuarial risks in that market that Congress wanted to correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.667" offset="13112591">And if you took the minimum coverage provision out and left the other two provisions in, there would be laid on top of the existing shifting of present actuarial risks an additional one because the uninsured would know that they would have guaranteed access to insurance whenever they became sick.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.397" offset="13191481">It would make the -- it would make the adverse selection in that market problem even worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.068" offset="13214155">And so what -- and Congress, trying to come up with a market-based solution to control rates in that market, has adopted something that would -- that would work to control costs by guaranteed-issue and community-rating; but, if you -- if -- if you take out the minimum coverage, that won't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.112" offset="13286357">That was Congress's assumption, again, shown by the text and legislative history of this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.666" offset="13308614">And that's why we think those things rise or fall in a package because they cut against what Congress was trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.920" offset="13333587">All of the other provisions would actually increase access to affordable care and would have advantageous effects on price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.110" offset="13370367">Again, Congress was invoking its traditional use of the tax code, which has long subsidized insurance through employers, has used that to impose a tax penalty on employers, to give tax credits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3364.875" offset="13569420">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.910" offset="13581541">At the outset, I would just like to say, I think that the government's position in this case that the community-rating and guaranteed-issue provisions ought to be struck down is an example of the best driving out the good; because, even without the minimum coverage provision, those two provisions, guaranteed-issue and community-rating, will still open insurance markets to millions of people that were excluded under the prior system, and for millions of people will lower prices, which were raised high under the old system because of their poor health.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.202" offset="13738694">So even though the system is not going to work precisely as Congress wanted, it would certainly serve central goals that Congress had of expanding coverage for people who were unable to get coverage or unable to get it at affordable prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.395" offset="13799507">So when the government--</text>

            <text syncTime="3423.647" offset="13804522">One of the points that Mr. Kneedler made is that the price won't be affordable because -- he spoke of the adverse selection problem, that there would be so fewer people in there, the insurance companies are going to have to raise the premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.308" offset="13879128">So it's nice that Congress made it possible for more people to be covered, but the reality is they won't because they won't be able to afford the premium.</text>

            <text syncTime="3454.433" offset="13927716">--Well, Justice Ginsburg, let me say two things about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.902" offset="13941508">First of all, when we talk about premiums becoming less affordable, it's very important to keep in mind different groups of people, because it is not something that applies accurately to everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.043" offset="13990096">For people who were not able to get insurance before, obviously, their insurance beforehand was -- the price was essentially infinite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.066" offset="14026249">They were not able to get it at any price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.334" offset="14035236">They will now be able to get it at a price that they can afford.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.404" offset="14051536">For people who are unhealthy and were able to get insurance, but perhaps not for the things that they were most concerned about, or only at very high rates, their rates will be lower under the system, even without the minimum coverage provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3583.567" offset="14444209">Well, in a moment, I'd like to talk about the finding; but, if I could just postpone that for a second and talk about adverse selection itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.923" offset="14481616">I think one of the misconceptions here, Justice Kagan, is that Congress, having seen the experience of the states in the '90s with community-rating and guaranteed-issue, simply imposed the minimum coverage provision as a possible way of dealing with that; and, if you don't have the minimum coverage provision, then, essentially, adverse selection runs rampant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.036" offset="14574089">But that's not what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.071" offset="14582240">Congress included at least half a dozen other provisions to deal with adverse selection caused by bringing in people who are less healthy into the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.946" offset="14629678">There are -- to begin with, the Act authorizes annual enrollment periods, so people can't just show up at the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.401" offset="14667503">If they don't show up and sign up at the right time, they at least have to wait until the time next year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.221" offset="14690805">That's authorized by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.723" offset="14696865">There -- with respect to the subsidies, there are three different things that make this important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.477" offset="14723823">First of all, the subsidies are very generous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.263" offset="14735004">For people below 200 percent of the federal poverty line, the subsidy will cover 80 percent, on average, of the premium which makes it attractive to them to join.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.421" offset="14787667">The structure of the subsidies, because their income -- they create a floor for -- based on the income of the person getting the insurance, and then the government covers everything over that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.030" offset="14846076">And this is important in adverse selection because if you do have a change in the mix of people, and average premiums start to rise, the government picks up the increase in the premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.490" offset="14895918">The amount that the person who is getting insured contributes remains constant at a percentage of his or her income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.744" offset="14924862">And the third thing--</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3705.679" offset="14932698">And there is nothing about federal support that is unsustainable, right?</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.998" offset="14949939">That is infinite.</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="3711.516" offset="14956000">--Well, I mean, that's a fair point, Justice Scalia; although, one of the things that happens, if you take the mandate out, while it is true that the subsidies that the government provides to any individual will increase, and they will be less efficient -- I'm not disputing that point -- actually the overall amount of the subsidies that the government will provide will decline, as the government notes itself in its brief, because there will be fewer people getting them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.352" offset="15075327">Some people will opt out of the system even though they are getting subsidies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.821" offset="15089224">But I would just like to go back for one more second to the point about how the subsidies are part of what Congress was using, because the other thing is that for people below 250 percent of the Federal poverty line Congress also picks up and subsidizes the out-of-pocket costs, raising the actuarial value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.817" offset="15173234">So you have all of that, and then you have Congress also, unlike the States establishing -- or I should be precisely accurate -- almost all the States, establishing an age differential of up to three to one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.796" offset="15245123">So an insurance company, for example, that is selling a 25-year-old a policy for $4,000 can charge a 60-year-old $12,000 for exactly the same coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.168" offset="15282635">The States typically in the 90s when they were instituting these programs, they either had pure community rating, where everybody is charged the same premium, everybody regardless of their age is charged the same premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.596" offset="15344284">Some states had a variance of 1.5 to 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.648" offset="15364555">Massachusetts, for example, which did have good subsidies, but their age band was two to one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3819.119" offset="15386393">So when Congress is enacting this Act, it's not simply looking at the States and thinking: Well, that didn't go very well; why don't we put in a minimum coverage provision; that will solve the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3833.045" offset="15442086">Congress did a lot of different things to try to combat the adverse selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.781" offset="15461103">Now, if I could turn to the finding, because I think this is the crux of the government's position and then the plaintiffs pick up on that, and then move -- move from that to the rest of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.338" offset="15507288">And it seems to me, quite honestly, it's an important part because that is textual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3855.894" offset="15533515">In this whole sort of quest for what we are trying to figure out, the finding seems to stand out as something that the Court could rely on and say here's something Congress has actually told us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.200" offset="15578759">But I think the real problem with the finding is the context in which Congress made it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.372" offset="15607389">It's quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3876.308" offset="15615121">If the Court wants to look, the finding is on page 42 -- 43A, excuse me, of the Solicitor General's severability brief in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.745" offset="15648872">But the finding is made specifically in the context of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.068" offset="15678233">That is why the findings are in the Act at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.970" offset="15693802">Congress wanted to indicate to the Court, knowing that the minimum coverage provision was going to be challenged, wanted to indicate to the Court the basis on which it believed it had the power under the Commerce Clause to enact this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3910.479" offset="15751898">Why does that make a difference with respect to finding I, which is the one that the government is relying on, and in particular the last sentence, which says</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.087" offset="15794321">"this requirement is essential to creating effective health insurance markets in which guaranteed-issue and preexisting illnesses can be covered. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3930.193" offset="15830684">The reason is because the word "essential" in the Commerce Clause context doesn't have the colloquial meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.213" offset="15862762">In the Commerce Clause context "essential" effectively means useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3944.116" offset="15886377">So that when one says in Lopez, when the Court says section 922(q) is not an essential part of a larger regulatory scheme of economic activity, it goes on to say, in which the regulatory scheme would be undercut if we didn't have this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3968.066" offset="15982194">Well, if that's all Congress means, I agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3973.203" offset="16002778">The system will be undercut somewhat if you don't have the minimum coverage provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3977.756" offset="16020960">It's like the word "necessary" in the Necessary and Proper Clause clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.791" offset="16033081">It doesn't mean, as the Court has said on numerous occasions, absolutely necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.693" offset="16052725">It means conducive to, useful, advancing the objectives, advancing the aims.</text>

            <text syncTime="4017.149" offset="16178530">Well, I think that there are several reasons that I would suggest that we would know that from.</text>
            <text syncTime="4024.085" offset="16206325">The first is, as I say, the findings themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.122" offset="16226387">Congress says at the very beginning, the head of it, is Congress makes the following findings, and they are talking about the interstate -- you know, B is headed</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.995" offset="16265884">"Effects on the national economy and interstate commerce. "</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.947" offset="16277691">So we know the context that Congress is talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4044.982" offset="16289812">It is more or less quoting from the Court's Commerce Clause statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.886" offset="16313427">But if one looks at the very preceding finding, which is finding H, which is on 42 over onto 43, Congress at that point also uses the word "essential".</text>
            <text syncTime="4062.623" offset="16360447">In the second sentence it says "this requirement" -- and again we're talking about the minimum coverage provision -- is an essential part of this larger regulation of economic activity, which is, by the way, an exact quote from Lopez, in which</text>
            <text syncTime="4077.982" offset="16421887">"the absence of the requirement undercuts Federal regulation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="4080.846" offset="16433276">also an exact quote from Lopez.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.527" offset="16440068">But what it is referring to is an essential -- an essential part of ERISA, the National Health Service Act and the Affordable Care Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.376" offset="16483432">It can't possibly be, even the plaintiffs haven't argued, that those Acts would all fall in their entirety if you took out the minimum coverage provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.476" offset="16535885">And as a second example of the same usage by Congress, the statute that was before the Court in Raich, section 801 of Title 21, the Court said that the regulation of intrastate drug activity, drug traffic, was essential to the regulation of interstate drug activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.492" offset="16631912">Again, it is simply not conceivable that Congress was saying one is so indispensable to the other, the way the United States uses the term here, so indispensable that if we can't regulate the intrastate traffic we don't want to regulate the interstate traffic, either.</text>
            <text syncTime="4148.874" offset="16705472">The whole law criminalizing drug traffic would fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="4153.898" offset="16725534">So I think once you look at the finding for what I believe it says, which is we believe this is a useful part of our regulatory scheme, which the Congress would think in its own approach would be sufficient--</text>

            <text syncTime="4191.563" offset="16876209">Those are all of the materials that are part of the legislative record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4197.941" offset="16901704">So even if it might not be because of the structure of the Act, that's post hoc evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="4228.506" offset="17023957">But the idea that -- that all the information before Congress only led to the idea that you would have death spirals seems to me to be contradicted a little bit at least by the CBO report in November of 2009, which is about 4 months before the Act passed, where the CBO talks about adverse selection.</text>

            <text syncTime="4263.276" offset="17163033">But nonetheless, the CBO goes through and talks about adverse selection, and points out the different provisions in the Act, the ones I have mentioned plus one other, actually, where in the first 3 years of the operation of the exchanges those insurance companies that get sort of a worse selection of consumers will be given essentially credits from insurance companies that get better selections.</text>

            <text syncTime="4352.982" offset="17521851">I mean, indeed, if one sort of looks at the legislative history more broadly, I think much of it is directed toward the idea that guaranteed -- issue and community rating were the crown jewel of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="4744.014" offset="19085959">--I guess to some extent I have to quarrel with the premise, Justice Scalia, because at least the -- the position that I'm advocating today, under which the Court would only take out the minimum coverage provision, I don't think would fit the description that you have given of taking out the heart of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4764.061" offset="19166207">Now, I do think once you take out guaranteed-issue and community rating, you are getting closer to the heart of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4769.785" offset="19189090">And one of the -- one of the difficulties I think with the government's position is that I think it's harder to cabin that, to draw that bright line around it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4781.179" offset="19234648">It's harder than the government thinks it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.060" offset="19242171">I mean, to begin with, even the government seems to acknowledge, I think, that the exchanges are going to be relatively pale relatives of -- of the exchanges as they're intended to be, where you're going to have standardized products, everybody can come and make comparisons based on products that look more or less the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="4802.004" offset="19317926">But the other thing that's going to happen is with the subsidy program.</text>
            <text syncTime="4806.220" offset="19334854">The -- the way that the subsidy program is -- is set up, the subsidy is calculated according to essentially a benchmark plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4817.548" offset="19380098">And this -- if the Court wants to look at the provisions, they're -- they begin at page 64A of the Private Plaintiffs' brief -- again, in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="4827.274" offset="19419072">The particular provision I'm talking about's at 68A, but there's a -- there's a question -- you -- you're looking essentially to calculate the premium by looking at a -- at a standardized silver plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4840.129" offset="19470481">First question, obviously, is, is there going to be any such plan if you don't have guaranteed-issue and community rating, if the plans can basically be individualized?</text>
            <text syncTime="4849.327" offset="19507262">But the second problem is that, in the provision on 68A, the -- the provision that's used for calculating the subsidy, what -- what is anticipated in the provision under the -- the Act as it is now, is that you do have the floor of the income, you would -- you would take this benchmark plan, and the government would pay -- pay the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4874.525" offset="19607990">And as we talked about earlier, the benchmark plan can change for age, and -- and the provision says it can be adjusted only for age.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.428" offset="19639650">So if in fact you even have such a thing as a benchmark plan anymore -- if the rates of people in poor health go up because of individual insurance underwriting, the government subsidy is not going to pay for that.</text>

            <text syncTime="5246.990" offset="21097910">Mr. Chief Justice, I will make four points in rebuttal, but I will start with Justice Sotomayor's question; which is to simply say this isn't just a tool; it's the principal tool, Congress identified it as an essential tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="5258.818" offset="21145244">It's not just a tool to make it work.</text>
            <text syncTime="5260.838" offset="21153289">It's a tool to pay for it, to make it affordable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5263.874" offset="21165410">And again, that's not my characterization; that's Congress's characterization in subfinding I on page 43a of the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5271.469" offset="21195817">Now, that bring me to my first point in rebuttal, which is Mr. Kneedler says quite correctly, tells this Court, don't look at the budgetary implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.127" offset="21226432">The problem with that, though, is once it's common ground, that the individual mandate is in the statute at least in part to make community rating and guaranteed-issue affordable, that really is all you have to identify.</text>
            <text syncTime="5292.075" offset="21278259">That establishes the essential link that it's there to pay for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.467" offset="21291843">You don't have to figure out exactly how much that is and which box -- I mean, it clearly is a substantial part of it, because what they were trying to do was take healthy individuals and put them into the risk pool, and this is quoting their finding, which is in order -- they put people into the market "which will lower premiums".</text>
            <text syncTime="5311.388" offset="21355477">So that's what their intent was.</text>
            <text syncTime="5313.378" offset="21363418">So you don't have to get to the -- the final number.</text>
            <text syncTime="5314.763" offset="21368956">You know that's what was going on here, and that's reason alone to sever it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5319.249" offset="21386929">Now the government -- Mr. Kneedler also says there is an easy dividing line between what they want to keep and what they want to dish out.</text>
            <text syncTime="5325.518" offset="21412006">The problem with that is that, you know, you read their brief and you might think oh, there is a guaranteed-issue and a community rating provision subtitle in the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="5333.129" offset="21442413">There is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5333.550" offset="21444085">To figure out what they are talking about you have to go to page 6 of their brief, of their opening severability brief, where they tell you what is in and what's out.</text>
            <text syncTime="5340.412" offset="21471565">And the easy dividing line they suggest is actually between 300g(a)(1) and 300g(a)(2), because on community rating they don't -- they say that (a)(1) goes, but then they say (a)(2) has to stay, because that's the way that you'll have some sort of, kind of Potemkin community rating for the exchanges.</text>
            <text syncTime="5360.440" offset="21551709">But if you actually look at those provisions, (a)(2) makes all these references to (a)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="5364.549" offset="21568114">It just doesn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.792" offset="21577100">Now, in getting back to the -- an inquiry that I think this Court actually can approach, is to look at what Congress was trying to do, you need look no further than look than the title of this statute: Patient Protection and Affordable Care.</text>
            <text syncTime="5377.809" offset="21621195">I agree with Mr. Farr that community rating and guaranteed-issue were the crown jewels of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5383.879" offset="21645436">They were what was trying to provide patient protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="5387.069" offset="21658184">And what made it affordable?</text>
            <text syncTime="5388.376" offset="21663409">The individual mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5389.807" offset="21669156">If you strike down guaranteed-issue, community rating and the individual mandate, there is nothing left to the heart of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5395.270" offset="21690994">And that takes me to my last point, which is simply this court in Buckley created a halfway house and it took Congress 40 years to try to deal with the situation, when contrary to any time of their intent, they had to try to figure out what are we going to do when we are stuck with this ban on contributions, but we can't get at expenditures because the Court told us we couldn't?</text>
            <text syncTime="5414.302" offset="21767167">And for 40 years they worked in that halfway house.</text>
            <text syncTime="5416.810" offset="21777198">Why make them do that in health care?</text>
            <text syncTime="5419.206" offset="21786707">The choice is to give Congress the task of fixing this statute, the residuum of this statute after some of it is struck down, or giving them the task of simply fixing the problem on a clean slate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5429.914" offset="21829547">I don't think that is a close choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5431.967" offset="21837802">If the individual mandate is unconstitutional, the rest of the Act should fall.</text>
