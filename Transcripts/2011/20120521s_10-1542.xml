            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">We have opinions this morning beginning with Justice Kagan in Number 10-1542, Holder versus Gutierrez and 10-1543, Holder versus Sawyers.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="11.794" offset="152597">These cases concern the reasonableness of the Board of Immigration Appeals or BIA's interpretation of a federal immigration statute, which I'll refer to as Section 1229 (b) (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="24.684" offset="204110">That statute gives the Attorney General discretion to allow otherwise removable aliens, usually aliens who have committed a crime, to stay in the country so long as they satisfy certain criteria, two of which are relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.990" offset="269416">First, subsection (a) (1) of the statute requires the alien to have held the status of a lawful permanent resident, in immigration lingo that's called LPR status, for at least five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.064" offset="329707">Second, subsection (a) (2) requires the alien to have continuously resided in the United States for at least seven years after being lawfully admitted, whatever his immigration status is.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.873" offset="384878">Now, there's a question about applying this statute to aliens who have lived in the country as children.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.286" offset="410582">Sometimes a child will enter the country lawfully or obtain LPR status after one of his parents does.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.666" offset="444123">In those situations, a parent might qualify for relief under the statute while his child, considered independently, does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.926" offset="481113">So the question arises, should the BIA require each alien to meet 1229 (b) (a)'s requirements on his own or should it impute a parent's years of LPR status or residence to his child.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.338" offset="550808">The cases before us illustrate how the issue comes up.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.045" offset="565645">There are two of them, but I will give you the facts of just one as an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.954" offset="585185">Carlos Martinez Gutierrez entered the country illegally with his family in 1989 when he was five years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.626" offset="619875">His father was lawfully admitted as an LPR just two years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.626" offset="639937">But Martinez Gutierrez was neither lawfully admitted nor given LPR status until 2003, so when Martinez Gutierrez committed a crime two years later in 2005, and that -- and that crime rendered him removable, he couldn't satisfy either subsection of 1229 (b) (a) without help from his father.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.034" offset="741606">The BIA has held that aliens, like Martinez Gutierrez, are out of luck.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.969" offset="761250">It is required each alien to independently satisfy 1229 (b) (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="169.349" offset="782775">Children don't get to borrow years of residence or immigration status from their parents, but the Ninth Circuit concluded that this position was unreasonable and held that the Board must impute a parent's immigration history to his or her child for any years in which the child lived with the parent as an unemancipated minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.293" offset="874621">We granted certiorari to decide this question to determine whether the BIA's no imputation policy is based on a reasonable construction of 1229 (b) (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="204.820" offset="924672">The construction need only be reasonable, it need not be the only construction or even the best one because we give deference to agencies when they interpret the statutes they administer and today, we hold that the BIA's interpretation of 1229 (b) (a) is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.587" offset="1003771">The Board's position is consistent with the statutory language which doesn't mention much less require imputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.571" offset="1035745">Instead, the statute simply calls for the alien to meet the prerequisites for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.345" offset="1062808">Gutierrez contends that this language doesn't foreclose imputation, but even if that's true, that is not enough to require the Board to adopt the policy and that so of a number of Martinez Gutierrez's arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.879" offset="1124979">He has presented a variety of reasons why the Board might read the statutes to permit imputation, but none requiring the Board to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.640" offset="1168029">We also reject Gutierrez's argument that the BIA's policy should be struck down because it is inconsistent with the Board's decision to allow imputation between parents and children in other immigration contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.593" offset="1227797">We think the BIA has done an adequate job of explaining why imputation might make sense in some areas but not in others.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.997" offset="1265413">We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.606" offset="1283803">Our opinion is unanimous.</text>
