            <text syncTime="6.770" offset="134089">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="10.689" offset="149762">The question in this case is whether the jury foreperson's announcement that the jury had voted unanimously that Petitioner was not guilty of capital murder and first degree murder has double jeopardy consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.400" offset="216531">We respectfully submit that it does, for two reasons:</text>
            <text syncTime="31.119" offset="231473">First, the foreperson's announcement on this record establishes an acquittal; and, second, even if it is not viewed as an acquittal, under this Court's well established standard, there was not manifest necessity for a second trial on the same murder charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.997" offset="306915">Now, with regard to the acquittal, the reasons why the foreperson's announcement was an acquittal are twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.087" offset="335336">First, the foreperson's announcement was clear and explicit that the jury had voted unanimously against guilt; and, second--</text>

            <text syncTime="77.833" offset="418301">And then the court specifically asked, what is the count on capital murder?</text>
            <text syncTime="83.487" offset="440871">And she said, unanimous against that.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.689" offset="449753">What is the count on first degree murder?</text>
            <text syncTime="87.889" offset="458530">Unanimous against that.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.558" offset="465217">And both the Arkansas trial court and the Arkansas Supreme Court here observed that the foreperson has been explicit that the jury had voted unanimously against guilt.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="100.532" offset="509103">Well, that's the count.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.982" offset="510879">A jury takes lots of votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.866" offset="518402">Was it utterly clear that the jury could not go back and reconsider that?</text>
            <text syncTime="108.619" offset="541495">Unless that was absolutely clear, it seems to me a verdict had not been announced.</text>

            <text syncTime="116.708" offset="573782">With -- with regard to finality, Your Honor, I think that -- that the jury could have changed its mind, but I want to emphasize the reason I say that, because I think it highlights something very important that is conspicuously absent here; and three brief points on that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.837" offset="638357">First, when the foreperson announced that the jury had voted unanimously against guilt on the murder charges, she was announcing a jury decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.776" offset="674092">There was nothing equivocal or qualified about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.227" offset="687885">Second, Your Honor--</text>

            <text syncTime="147.596" offset="697393">When you say she was announcing a decision, then you mean they can't go back on it?</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>

            <label>Mr. Clifford M. Sloan</label>

            <text syncTime="158.185" offset="739712">She was announcing the decision that they had made at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.254" offset="752042">But the reason -- my second point, Your Honor, the reason why I say that they could have gone back is the historic traditional principle that a jury can correct or revise a verdict while it continues to be sitting.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.330" offset="804286">Now, in -- in this Court's opinion, in Smith v. Massachusetts, this Court talked about that traditional and historic principle, cited an English case from 1824, the Parkin case, where the jury had done that, had gone back after announcing a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.756" offset="866040">And how that would play out here, if the jury came back and they said, you know, we were unanimous before, but now one juror says that he doesn't really agree with that, then, of course, a court could take that into account.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="203.581" offset="921315">I think you've conceded away your case when you say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.683" offset="929674">The one characteristic of a verdict that seems perfectly clear to me is that it is final.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.337" offset="952348">The jury can't render a verdict and be discharged and then come back the next day and say, you know what, some of us -- one of us has changed his mind or her mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.728" offset="993935">It's the final vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.128" offset="999473">And so why isn't the critical question here whether what the -- what the foreperson said was, this is our final vote, we're not going to go back, this is it; or this is the way we voted, now and it's -- one or more of us may have wanted to -- wanted to retain the right, reserve the right to go back and -- and vote again.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.330" offset="1112322">First, there was the explicit statement of -- of what the vote was at that time; but, second, there is nothing on the record in this case that contradicts that statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="767.548" offset="3177145">And as to that, this Court's opinions are clear that if you have a State law that prevents giving effect to what is in substance an acquittal, it must yield to the Federal constitutional command of the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2010.317" offset="8148247">Well, there are a couple of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.400" offset="8156606">One, I think it's fair to say that the state recognizes it was improper for the judge to inquire in the way that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.772" offset="8186073">I think that it's fair to say that he recognized that it was improper, as he didn't do it on their first announcement of deadlock and he didn't do it on their final announcement of deadlock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.611" offset="8221390">It's important to note that, although defense counsel at trial did ask for revised verdict forms, that was not her initial reaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.002" offset="8266948">Her initial reaction was to say, judge, I think that the jury needs to go back and keep deliberating and I would ask that you give them another Allen charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.406" offset="8296623">That's not the reaction that anyone would have if they had just heard an acquittal of their client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.977" offset="8314908">This was in fact a mid deliberation report, probably wrongfully elicited by the trial judge, but it was just that, a snapshot in time with no intent by the jury to make an announcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.301" offset="8368198">So, when they returned, the real question, I think, hinges as this Court analyzed in Smith versus Massachusetts is, is it possible for there to be revision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.057" offset="8403202">And it doesn't in fact, Justice Kagan, have to be the entirety of the jury completely pivoting in their decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2082.179" offset="8435699">And we recognize that, even after they have announced unanimously, signed the verdict form, offered their assent, if they are polled in the box and one person changes their vote, then that bears the effect of changing the verdict.</text>

            <text syncTime="3312.811" offset="13358213">But once a jury says it's unanimous, a judge can't declare a mistrial, can't do something until it ensures itself that jeopardy has attached.</text>

            <label>Mr. Clifford M. Sloan</label>
            <text syncTime="3437.759" offset="13857988">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.578" offset="13869273">The core of the State's position is that the foreperson's explicit announcement that the jury had unanimously voted against guilt is of no constitutional moment whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.938" offset="13930713">Now, there is no opinion of this Court that has ever said that a jury statement like that is entitled to no weight whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.662" offset="13973658">And if this Court were to say that in an opinion, it would open the door to many of the core double jeopardy evils that this Court has repeatedly focused on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.286" offset="14016081">For example, acquittal avoidance, emphasized in the Arizona v. Washington; a court doesn't want to accept the acquittal consequences, so it just says, we're not going to accept that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.059" offset="14055160">And something that's a very real and practical danger here, which this Court has emphasized over and over again in opinions, is giving the State the opportunity to refine and hone its case based on what it learned at the first trial about what went badly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.687" offset="14125690">And that is exactly what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.287" offset="14132169">It was vigorously contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.823" offset="14138229">The State's capital murder and murder -- first-degree murder case fell apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.543" offset="14161113">Their lead expert on it was destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.578" offset="14173338">The jury heard both sides, voted unanimously not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.196" offset="14187757">And as this Court said in Ashe v. Swenson, a core evil of the Double Jeopardy Clause is that we don't let the prosecutor have a dry run at a first trial, and then get to go before a second trial with a new jury and plug the holes in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.123" offset="14247421">And the State's position here, that this is of no moment at all, would raise that danger very prominently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.746" offset="14282007">In conclusion, Your Honor, the jury in this case heard the evidence on both sides, unanimously voted against guilt on the murder charges, announced that in open court, and never said a word that contradicted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.255" offset="14343970">Forcing Petitioner to run the gauntlet a second time on the murder charges would run counter to what this Court has repeatedly emphasized as the core purposes, policy and language of the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.248" offset="14399976">If there are no further questions, Your Honor--</text>
