            <text syncTime="12.408" offset="152952">Recognizing that certain offenders convicted before enactment or implementation of SORNA would be unable to comply with SORNA's initial registration requirement, Congress included section 16913(d) delegating to the Attorney General the authority to determine whether and how to apply SORNA's registration requirements to those offenders.</text>

            <text syncTime="56.837" offset="330689">Action by the Attorney General was needed to bring offenders like Mr. Reynolds into the new system, and because those implementing SORNA, in determining whether and how SORNA would be applied to pre-enactment offenders, would require time and consideration, Congress left the Wetterling Act registration law in place for 3 years to ensure that all offenders would be covered under the old law.</text>

            <text syncTime="409.865" offset="1742869">I -- I don't know of any parallel and -- and I -- I think it's -- it's sailing close to the edge of unconstitutionality; whereas, what the other side claims is simply, it's a crime to begin with, but the Attorney General can make it not a crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="948.455" offset="3897240">Some sex offenders, you know, from the various states, there were state laws that were varied amongst each other, and there was a federal Wetterling Act that had its own periods of registration and different requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.964" offset="3959202">And I think that, um, one of the permutations, some of them are that some sex offenders never had to register in some states; some had been convicted before and had served out their time and no longer had to register; and some were released from prison, you know, before the enactment or implementation of SORNA.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.211" offset="4044257">And an example of a permutation that was going to have some cloth for consideration is the one that's sort of an example in a different context, in the federal register and in the government's brief which is that certain people who had served their time and were completely out of the system, if they got rearrested for a misdemeanor, the Attorney General decided that those individuals did not have to register for a state to be deemed substantially implemented with respect to SORNA.</text>

            <text syncTime="1628.659" offset="6618049">It defined a sex offender, unlike SORNA, as somebody who is convicted of a sex offense, and in guidelines issued after Wetterling and after several subsequent amendments to the Wetterling Act, the Attorney General interpreted it as only requiring States to register offenders that are convicted not only post-enactment, but post-implementation by the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1660.980" offset="6747303">And so when Congress enacted SORNA, it switched from "is convicted" to "was convicted" in order to include pre-enactment offenders.</text>

            <text syncTime="1923.577" offset="7797635">So these are the same registries that have been in existence in all 50 States for the last decade.</text>

            <text syncTime="1943.923" offset="7879032">That is what (c) requires; it's what he was required to do even before SORNA was enacted; and what Congress did with respect to the subset of sex offenders that haven't already registered before SORNA but that need to get on the registry -- afterwards, because, for example, their sex offense wasn't covered before SORNA.</text>

            <text syncTime="2381.170" offset="9628087">The one thing I would say on the outset, however, is when you say that, when you read those sections, you can read them as applying to only postenactment offenders, I don't think that's right, especially because of subsection (b), because on the day that SORNA was enacted, every single person in prison at that time was be definition a pre-enactment offender, and so on its face when you read subsection (b), it quite easily applies to quite a number of pre-enactment offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.118" offset="9727875">And the other point I would make along those lines is that fact subsection (b) just doesn't talk about pre-enactment, it talks about pre-implementation offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.455" offset="9757236">So offenders that were convicted after SORNA's enactment but before SORNA was implemented, again quite easily fit not only within subsection (b) but within all the other subsections as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.997" offset="9799346">And with respect to the interrelationship between them, I think subsection (a) really identifies the jurisdiction in which a defendant needs to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.686" offset="9838111">So the first instance the jurisdictions in which an offender both needs to register and to keep the information current.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.404" offset="9860995">Subsection (b) really serves a limited purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.974" offset="9875310">It's an intake process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.257" offset="9880430">It's getting an offender into the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.243" offset="9888371">For offenders like Reynolds who are already in the very same system, there is nothing to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.294" offset="9908537">(B) simply doesn't apply to them -- (B) is applied to people who are not already in that system, and for those that can comply with the timing, it gets them in before their release to the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.400" offset="9952946">But the inability to comply with subsection (b) for the small set of offenders that cannot comply were with the timing requirements, it doesn't immunize them from complying with all the other registries--</text>

            <text syncTime="2542.352" offset="10272789">Number one, for offenders like Reynolds that are already registered, there's nothing more to be done as far as registration goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.006" offset="10295359">All that he needs to do is to keep the information current and to keep it updated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.391" offset="10308942">The other point I would make, since we're talking about 2250, Congress provided other protections for offenders that were unable to comply with the timing requirements, number one -- it provided impossibility affirmative defense in 2250(b), and the other thing that Congress did is it required that any failure to register in order to be subject to prevailing sanctions, that it be a knowing failure to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.275" offset="10408521">In other words, that the offender know he has a registration requirement and know that he is not complying with that requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.345" offset="10432763">So the idea that there are some hypothetical or maybe even not so hypothetical sex offenders out there who can't comply with the precise timing in (b) and will -- have no idea what they are required to do, they are not going to be criminally liable under 2250 because there is an impossibility defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.140" offset="10503920">And to the extent they don't know that they have a registrational requirement, they're also not going to be criminally liable under 2250.</text>

            <text syncTime="3166.246" offset="12768319">In the Senate bill that you are talking about it defined a sex offender as anybody who has been convicted of a sex offense and as this Court said in Carr, that is the language that Congress quite often uses when it intends to include pre-enactment conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.053" offset="12823594">So I think the verb choice, both in the Senate bill, in the House bill, and in the bill that was actually enacted, indicates that it did intend to include pre-enactment offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.909" offset="12859016">The other point I would want to make is again, another point that was made in Carr, which is that the registration requirements stand at the very center of Congress's efforts to find and to register the 100,000 missing sex offenders that have fallen off the registry rolls under the previous regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.419" offset="12921083">So I think it is quite clear with respect to SORNA that Congress did want to include pre-enactment offenders; it wanted to not only find those missing sex offenders; it wanted to make sure that they got back on the registry rolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.194" offset="12976149">And as far as of the hundreds of thousands of offenders that were already on the registry rolls when SORNA was enacted, they wanted to make sure that they stayed on the registry rolls, that they kept the information current; they continued to update their information going forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.354" offset="13028812">And again, with respect to pre-enactment offenders that were in prison at the time that SORNA was enacted, it wanted to make sure to get them on the registry rolls before they left prison, before they--</text>

            <text syncTime="3253.602" offset="13117733">I mean, if the Attorney General had within a few months done what he ultimately did a year later or whatever time period after, had come out and said, it applies; this is what you do; briefly, you register wherever you were convicted or -- et cetera, if you move or change your name, then Congress would have accomplished the goal it wanted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3290.477" offset="13265272">And why did -- the Attorney General didn't try to act very quickly, and if the Attorney General thought that SORNA applied from day 1, why is the Attorney General trying to go through regulation that said nothing more than SORNA applies?</text>

            <label>Ms. Melissa Arbus Sherry</label>
            <text syncTime="3306.819" offset="13330683">Because when the Attorney General issued the interim rule, what he said was that reading it on the face, I do think it applies to everybody, but I recognize the defendants are making an alternative argument and I think it's incredibly important that it apply to everybody, and that it apply to everyone quickly, because we are talking about protecting our communities; we're talking about protecting the public and protecting our children from sex offenders, and having this uncertainty out there is -- is not only not good for protecting the public, but it's not good for sex offenders; it's not good for jurisdictions that are trying to work towards substantial implementation of SORNA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.259" offset="13472371">And so I think you could look at it one of two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.027" offset="13487522">If the idea is, well, Congress left it to the Attorney General, but the Attorney General sort of acted very quickly, I think that suggests that there probably wasn't that much for the Attorney General to do in the first place, and there is little reason that Congress would not have made that decision on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.371" offset="13540812">To the extent you think there was a whole bunch of things for the Attorney General to do, which again we disagree with, presumably that is something that would take some time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.393" offset="13572995">During the interim period those 100,000 sex offenders would remain missing; additional sex offenders would be added to that number and the community and public would continue to be at risk going forward.</text>

            <text syncTime="3461.248" offset="13948322">I would like to address one point the Government made, that there's no need to reregister -- someone in Mr. Reynolds' position -- once they have been registered under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.274" offset="14004433">They acknowledge the opposite themselves in footnote 12, where they say that --</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.178" offset="14028048">"that a Government or a State will have been deemed to substantially implement SORNA if it registers pre-enactment and pre-implementation sex offenders who remain in the system as registrants, as well as other people. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.425" offset="14109027">So it's clear that the Government believes that -- acknowledges that people who are already registered must reregister under SORNA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.447" offset="14145181">The most important thing is that this -- the SORNA statute -- the obligation under SORNA begins with initial registration, and does not begin with a State registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.479" offset="14241311">And enactment, Congress knew that certain people would be unable to register under subsection (b), and that is why they enacted subsection (d).</text>
