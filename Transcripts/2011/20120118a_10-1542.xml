            <text syncTime="11.056" offset="149671">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.974" offset="161270">Under section 1229b of Title 8, an alien who has not been a lawful permanent resident for at least 5 years, or who has not continuously resided in the United States for at least 7 years following admission in any status, is not eligible for cancellation of removal under the first prong of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.737" offset="236398">That is true regardless of whether the alien can show that his parents, or any other third party, for that matter, did satisfy those requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.541" offset="267536">The Ninth Circuit alone among the courts of appeals has recognized a rule of imputed eligibility under section 1229b(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="49.397" offset="302958">That rule is wrong for at least two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.449" offset="315183">First of all, it is inconsistent with the plain text of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.968" offset="329289">The touchstones of eligibility under section 1229b(a), LPR status, admission and residence, are all terms that are defined in the INA to refer to attributes that are individual to the alien seeking relief, attributes that cannot be satisfied by a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.446" offset="395222">But even if the statute were thought to be ambiguous with respect to this question, the Board of Immigration Appeals has interpreted the statute to mean that the alien seeking relief must personally and actually satisfy both durational requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.356" offset="450811">That interpretation is at the very least a reasonable reading of the statute, if not the only reading of the statute--</text>

            <text syncTime="101.866" offset="512878">As I read its opinion, it felt that it had to come to that conclusion as a matter of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="131.301" offset="630638">But if you look at the board's decision In re Escobar in particular, I think the board makes clear that, although it thought the statutory language was clear, it also rested its decision on other considerations that are uniquely within the board's expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.376" offset="682883">It discussed how the imputation rule comports with the general policies of the statute, how it comports with the rule that the board itself has recognized over time that LPR status is something that's individual to a particular alien, and that the alien seeking relief has to individually, both procedurally and substantively, satisfy the eligibility requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.872" offset="760936">And it also noted that the imputation rule would create significant holes in the statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.176" offset="782148">It would mean that an individual who may not even have been eligible for admission to the United States or lawful admission for permanent residence would nevertheless receive a significant benefit that goes along with that status.</text>

            <text syncTime="203.933" offset="921119">And this statute I think is unambiguous in that it refers to eligibility requirements that are by their nature as defined in immigration law individual to a specific alien.</text>

            <text syncTime="232.916" offset="1037103">The Respondents relied very heavily on three court of appeals cases that had interpreted the predecessor to this statute, former section 212(c), to allow imputation of the parents' domicile to a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.176" offset="1086109">Those courts relied on the common law rule that a child's domicile follows that of his parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.562" offset="1107634">And applying that rule, they allowed children to rely on their parents' domicile in the United States to satisfy the 7-year lawful unrelinquished domicile requirement in that statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="279.231" offset="1222363">When Congress repealed former section 212(c) and enacted the current cancellation of removal statute, it removed any reference to the word 7 years unrelinquished domicile with two durational requirements that are at issue in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="311.452" offset="1351199">I think if this Court is willing to presume along with Respondents that Congress would have been aware of these three court of appeals decisions that were issued, it should be noted, very late in the life of a provision that had existed in more or less the same form since the Immigration Act of 1917, then the Court also must presume that Congress was aware that the basis for those decisions was the common law definition of the term "domicile", and that Congress meant what it did when it replaced "domicile" with three eligibility criteria that are defined terms in the immigration law and all of which refer to attributes that are individual to a specific alien.</text>

            <text syncTime="369.324" offset="1582749">So yes, a child will dwell somewhere in fact and can do so independent of the parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.811" offset="1608662">That is in marked contrast to the common law rule of domicile that this Court explained at length in its Holyfield decision and that the courts of appeals applied in interpreting former section 212(c).</text>

            <text syncTime="472.290" offset="1994543">The child has lived with the parents for 5 years, whether before or after -- well, after it wouldn't be an issue, but before the grant of LPR status.</text>

            <text syncTime="487.734" offset="2056401">I thought the idea of the statute was to give individuals who had ties to the United States an opportunity to stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.690" offset="2096212">If a child's been with their parents for 5, 10, 15 years, what sense does it make to deprive them of the Attorney General's exercise of discretion merely because the administrative process has taken too long to give them something which they are going to get and which they've gotten?</text>

            <text syncTime="527.126" offset="2213972">It is certainly true that it's an important criteria in determining whether or not an individual is entitled as a matter of discretion to cancellation of removal relief, how strong their ties are to the United States, what their family ties are and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.452" offset="2271232">But it has never been thought that particularly compelling reasons for the exercise of discretion can overcome the plain threshold requirements for eligibility for the exercise of discretion under 1229b.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.609" offset="2323895">The difficulty with the imputation rule that the Ninth Circuit has recognized is that it undermines the plain requirements for those threshold determinations of eligibility, conferring an important benefit that goes along with long-time permanent resident status and long-time continuous residence after admission on individuals who not only did not receive the necessary formal authorization from immigration officials at the requisite time; they may not even have been eligible to receive those authorizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.581" offset="2455761">I think it's also worth noting that this statute is not the beginning and the end of discretion in the immigration system.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.336" offset="2482719">It is always true, and it certainly was the case when Congress enacted the statute in 1996, that immigration officials have the discretion not to bring removal proceedings in the first place, to terminate removal proceedings once they have begun, to defer action on the execution of a removal order; and current immigration and customs enforcement guidance makes clear that a minor receives particular consideration within the totality of the circumstances in determining whether or not prosecutorial discretion is something that should be exercised.</text>

            <text syncTime="1500.040" offset="6105590">I think Respondents make the argument that Lepe-Guitron was in fact imputing LPR status as opposed to residence in fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="1515.918" offset="6169119">All three courts of appeals that Respondents rely on dealt separately with the threshold requirement under former section 212(c) that the alien be a lawful permanent resident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.274" offset="6206527">None of those three courts permitted LPR status to be imputed from parent to child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.511" offset="6227425">So where there was an explicit requirement in the statute that LPR status be obtained by the alien seeking relief, the courts were very clear in requiring that the alien before them independently satisfied that requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.521" offset="6287506">In Lepe-Guitron, the Ninth Circuit acknowledged that under circuit precedent it had held that domicile requires an intent to remain permanently in the United States lawfully and said that that meant that the alien had to be in LPR status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.114" offset="6345916">Lepe-Guitron said that with respect to children that intent to remain in the United States lawfully need not be an LPR status so long as their parents were lawfully domiciled in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2057.102" offset="8333834">So if you had a child coming forth, you have to look in certain circumstances at least to the parent for intent of abandonment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2504.292" offset="10122595">So far as subsection (2) of the provision that we are talking about this morning, which is the provision that concerns me in the Sawyers case, we think that the government's reading is simply not a sensible approach to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.200" offset="10174213">And in that sense, our position is not that the statute is ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.819" offset="10188737">We think that the statutory context and the particular meaning of the words that Congress used require imputation in the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.508" offset="10223428">I will start with the statutory background, where I think the government understates the nature of the prevailing settled rule that it applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="2539.132" offset="10261985">We usually like to start with the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.250" offset="10274419">Where is this issue addressed in this statute at all?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="2545.952" offset="10289256">Imputation as such, as has been said, is not directly addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.088" offset="10305766">But the words that Congress used, the word "residence" and the words particularly "continuous residence", are words that Congress would have thought carried along with it the concept of imputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.562" offset="10347666">And the reason why that is so, I think it's necessary to start with a little bit of the background both of the statute and how those words have been interpreted in prior usages, Congress would have been aware of when it used them in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.854" offset="10400852">Under the prior relief provision here, section 212(c), the old provision, the courts, courts of appeals that had addressed it, had uniformly applied an imputation rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.094" offset="10441812">The government said -- it's three courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.046" offset="10457590">Two of those courts are the Second and Ninth Circuits, the largest immigration circuits that decide two-thirds of the immigration cases in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.885" offset="10484966">So I think one can presume that Congress would have been aware of this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.337" offset="10498759">And the government concedes that Congress didn't change the language of 212(c) because it was dissatisfied with imputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.991" offset="10521433">It had other purposes in mind altogether.</text>

            <text syncTime="3454.520" offset="13923516">But what do you respond to the point that lawfulness has been attributed, not just intent, but under the prior law, lawfulness was also attributed?</text>

            <text syncTime="3465.244" offset="13966357">I think this goes back to the answer I was giving to Justice Breyer earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.696" offset="13980254">Where former section 212(c) had an explicit lawful status requirement, which is the status of being a lawful permanent resident, no court of appeals allowed imputation from parents to child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.921" offset="14029155">Their argument is a little bit more convoluted than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.390" offset="14042948">It is that because domicile, lawful unrelinquished domicile, was interpreted to mean the ability to form a lawful intent to remain permanently in the United States, and the Ninth Circuit said you could only form such an intent if you were a lawful permanent resident, that in Lepe-Guitron, the Ninth Circuit was therefore necessarily imputing LPR status from parent to child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.203" offset="14126226">I think the more straightforward way to read the Ninth Circuit's decision is that it was imputing the intent to remain permanently in the United States from parent to child, based in part on the parents' establishment of the domicile, and based on the common law rule that the child's domicile follows that of his parents.</text>

            <text syncTime="3532.087" offset="14233746">Well, in -- in addition to discussing the individual nature of LPR status, they also noted the consequence of the Ninth Circuit's imputation rule would be to permit a kind of end run around the substantive eligibility requirements for LPR status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.565" offset="14295709">So theoretically, you could have an individual minor alien who's not eligible, who's inadmissible for adjustment of status who would nevertheless be accorded a substantial benefit of that status without regard to whether or not he could have received that status in fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="3610.306" offset="14546693">When Congress enacted the present cancellation of removal statute, it preserved that threshold requirement that you have to be an LPR in order to seek relief, but it added the durational requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.178" offset="14586086">You had to have attained that status at least 5 years before you sought relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.482" offset="14603327">There's no reason to think, if there's no precedent for imputing LPR status in the first place, that there would be precedence for imputing LPR status going back 5 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.671" offset="14640107">One necessarily follows from the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.638" offset="14647944">If I could, I'd like to address the other proposition that Respondent Sawyers makes, that courts were necessarily imputing residence as an element of domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.210" offset="14682216">That argument relies heavily on the 1967 regional commissioner decision dealing with firm resettlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.864" offset="14704891">If you look at that decision, you'll see that the regional commissioner focused very intensely on the minor alien's particular actions -- identity, documents that he received personally from the foreign country, his own schooling and to residence, and the degree to which the regional Commissioner rested on principles of imputation is entirely unclear.</text>
