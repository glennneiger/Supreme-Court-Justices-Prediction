            <text syncTime="12.724" offset="58781">The Affordable Care Act addresses a fundamental and enduring problem in our health care system and our economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.798" offset="111025">Insurance has become the predominant means of paying for health care in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.119" offset="136312">For most Americans, for more than 80 percent of Americans, the insurance system does provide effective access.</text>

            <text syncTime="47.647" offset="198379">But for more than 40 million Americans who do not have access to health insurance either through their employer or through government programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, the system does not work.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.990" offset="255848">Those individuals must resort to the individual market, and that market does not provide affordable health insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.096" offset="292211">It does not do so because, because the multibillion dollar subsidies that are available for the, the employer market are not available in the individual market.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.372" offset="357308">It does not do so because ERISA and HIPAA regulations that preclude, that preclude discrimination against people based on their medical history do not apply in the individual market.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.699" offset="410598">That is an economic problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="107.185" offset="436616">They can address it directly, Justice Scalia, and they are addressing it directly through this, through this Act by regulating the means by which health care, by which health care is purchased.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.945" offset="495652">That is the way this Act works.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.981" offset="503803">Under the Commerce Clause, what, what Congress has done is to enact reforms of the insurance market, directed at the individual insurance market, that preclude, that preclude discrimination based on pre-existing conditions, that require guaranteed issue and community rating, and it uses -- and the minimum coverage provision is necessary to carry into execution those insurance reforms.</text>

            <text syncTime="162.070" offset="656149">In this case, the -- what is being regulated is the method of financing health, the purchase of health care.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.943" offset="687600">That itself is economic activity with substantial effects on interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="187.854" offset="759280">That's not our position at all, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.006" offset="767848">In the health care market, the health care market is characterized by the fact that aside from the few groups that Congress chose to exempt from the minimum coverage requirement -- those who for religious reasons don't participate, those who are incarcerated, Indian tribes -- virtually everybody else is either in that market or will be in that market, and the distinguishing feature of that is that they cannot, people cannot generally control when they enter that market or what they need when they enter that--</text>

            <text syncTime="825.135" offset="3308413">And the tangible result of it is -- we were told there was one brief that Maryland Hospital Care bills 7 percent more because of these uncompensated costs, that families pay a thousand dollars more than they would if there were no uncompensated costs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1247.973" offset="4999685">General, I see or have seen three strands of arguments in your briefs, and one of them is echoed today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.029" offset="5035943">The first strand that I have seen is that Congress can pass any necessary laws to effect those powers within its rights, i.e., because it made a decision that to effect, to effect mandatory issuance of insurance, that it could also obligate the mandatory purchase of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.464" offset="5153703">The second strand I see is self-insurance affects the market, and so the government can regulate those who self-insure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.189" offset="5200619">And the third argument -- and I see all of them as different -- is that what the government is doing, and I think it's the argument you're making today -- that what the -- what the government is saying is if you pay for -- if you use health services, you have to pay with insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.435" offset="5281598">Because only insurance will guarantee that whatever need for health care that you have will be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.875" offset="5319319">Because virtually no one, perhaps with the exception of 1 percent of the population, can afford the massive cost if the unexpected happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.449" offset="5369683">This third argument seems to be saying what we are regulating is health care, and when you go for health services, you have to pay for insurance, and since insurance won't issue at the moment that you consume the product, we can reasonably, necessarily tell you to buy it ahead of time, because you can't buy it at the moment that you need it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1378.158" offset="5520462">The Congress enacted reforms of the insurance market, the guaranteed-issue and community-rating reforms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.597" offset="5562258">It did so to deal with a very serious problem that results in 40 million people not being able to get insurance and therefore not access to the health care market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.635" offset="5598412">Everybody agrees in this case that those are within Congress's Article I powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.937" offset="5619623">The minimum coverage provision is necessary to carry those provisions into -- into execution; because without them, without those provisions, without minimum coverage, guaranteed issue and community rating will, as the experience in the States showed, make matters worse, not better.</text>

            <text syncTime="1504.136" offset="6024416">They have agreed that Congress has Article I authority to impose an insurance requirement or other -- or other penalty at the point of sale, and they have agreed that Congress has the authority to do that to achieve the same objectives that the minimum coverage provision of the Affordable Care Act is designed to achieve.</text>

            <text syncTime="1561.007" offset="6251891">On the other hand, it means that since the Court can do it anyway -- Congress can do it anyway, we give a certain amount of latitude.</text>

            <text syncTime="1574.748" offset="6306852">The, the -- I do think one striking feature of the argument here that this is a novel exercise of power is that what Congress chose to do was to rely on market mechanisms and efficiency and a method that has more choice than would the traditional Medicare/Medicaid type model; and so it seems a little ironic to suggest that that counts against it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3402.622" offset="13618317">The mandate represents an unprecedented effort by Congress to compel individuals to enter commerce in order to better regulate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.629" offset="13658336">The Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate existing commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.883" offset="13683414">It does not give Congress the far greater power to compel people to enter commerce to create commerce essentially in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.055" offset="13716015">Now, Congress when it passed the statute did make findings about why it thought it could regulate the commerce here, and it justified the mandate as a regulation of the economic decision to forego the purchase of health insurance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3482.124" offset="13936384">Well, Justice, I think there is two points to make on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.142" offset="13948400">One is, a lot of the discussion this morning so far has proceeded on the assumption that the only thing that is at issue here is emergency room visits, and the only thing that's being imposed is catastrophic care coverage; but, as the Chief Justice indicated earlier, a lot of the insurance that's being covered is for ordinary preventive care, ordinary office visits, and those are the kinds of things that one can predict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.989" offset="14031783">So there is a big part of the market that's regulated here that wouldn't pose the problem that you're suggesting; but, even as to emergency room visits, it certainly would be possible to regulate at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.363" offset="14073265">You could simply say, through some sort of mandate on the insurance companies, you have to provide people that come in -- this will be a high-risk pool, and maybe you will have to share it amongst yourself or something, but people simply have to sign up at that point, and that would be regulating at the point of sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="3529.355" offset="14125301">Well, Mr. Clement, now it seems as though you're just talking about a matter of timing; that Congress can regulate the transaction, and the question is when does it make best sense to regulate that transaction?</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.847" offset="14175247">And Congress surely has within its authority to decide, rather than at the point of sale, given an insurance-based mechanism, it makes sense to regulate it earlier.</text>

            <text syncTime="3560.726" offset="14250794">Because if Congress tried to regulate at the point of sale, the one group that it wouldn't capture at all are the people who don't want to purchase health insurance and also have no plans of using health care services in the near term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.015" offset="14295933">And Congress very much wanted to capture those people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.117" offset="14308263">I mean, those people are essentially the golden geese that pay for the entire lowering of the premium.</text>

            <text syncTime="3623.132" offset="14500420">One is, as Justice Alito's question suggested earlier, I mean, somebody who is not in the insurance market is sort of irrelevant as an actuarial risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.470" offset="14533752">I mean, we could look at the people not in the insurance market, and what we'd find is that they're relatively young, relatively healthy, and they would have a certain pool of actuarial risks that would actually lead to lower premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.094" offset="14576175">The people that would be captured by guaranteed rating and community issue -- guaranteed issue and community rating would presumably have a higher risk profile, and there would be higher premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.402" offset="14617448">And one of the things, one of the things Congress sought to accomplish here, was to force individuals into the insurance market to subsidize those that are already in it to lower the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.674" offset="14654542">And that's just not my speculation, that's Finding I at 43A of the government's brief that -- it has the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3675.582" offset="14710131">Let me put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.617" offset="14714310">Congress, in the '30s, saw a real problem of people needing to have old age and survivor's insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.588" offset="14746180">And yes, they did it through a tax, but they said everybody has got to be in it because if we don't have the healthy in it, there's not going to be the money to pay for the ones who become old or disabled or widowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.620" offset="14830294">So they required everyone to contribute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.488" offset="14841788">It was a big fuss about that in the beginning because a lot of people said -- maybe some people still do today -- I could do much better if the government left me alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.010" offset="14879927">I'd go into the private market, I'd buy an annuity, I'd make a great investment, and they're forcing me to paying for this Social Security that I don't want; but, that's constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.152" offset="14928410">So if Congress could see this as a problem when we need to have a group that will subsidize the ones who are going to get the benefits, it seems to me you are saying the only way that could be done is if the government does it itself; it can't involve the private market, it can't involve the private insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.398" offset="15017435">If it wants to do this, Social Security is its model.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.719" offset="15030705">The government has to do -- has to be government takeover.</text>

            <text syncTime="3766.808" offset="15075114">The most straightforward one would be to figure out what amount of subsidy to the insurance industry is necessary to pay for guaranteed issue and community rating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.847" offset="15111267">And once we calculate the amount of that subsidy, we could have a tax that's spread generally through everybody to raise the revenue to pay for that subsidy.</text>

            <text syncTime="4846.673" offset="19394513">And that gets at the idea that there is two kinds of cost shifting that are going on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4851.226" offset="19412798">One is the concern about emergency care and that somehow somebody who gets sick is going to shift costs back to other policy areas -- holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.047" offset="19444041">But there is a much bigger cost shifting going on here, and that's the cost shifting that goes on when you force healthy people into an insurance market precisely because they are healthy, precisely because they are not likely to go to the emergency room, precisely because they are not likely to use the insurance they are forced to buy in the health care insurance.</text>

            <text syncTime="4910.932" offset="19651558">You've seen in Lopez this Court say that we cannot, Congress cannot get into purely local affairs, particularly where they are noncommercial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4921.121" offset="19692309">And, of course, the greatest limiting principle of all, which not too many accept, so I'm not going to emphasize that, is the limiting principle derived from the fact that members of Congress are elected from States and that 95 percent of the law of the United States is State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4938.082" offset="19760123">That is a principle though enforced by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4941.551" offset="19774020">The other two are principles, one written into Lopez and one you just heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4946.355" offset="19793246">It seems to me all of those eliminate the broccoli possibility, and none of them eliminates the possibility that we are trying to take the 40 million people who do have the medical cost, who do affect interstate commerce and provide a system that you may like or not like.</text>

            <text syncTime="5083.493" offset="20341817">And that's exactly why I think it's very important for this Court to think seriously about taking an unprecedented step of saying that the commerce power not only includes the power to regulate, prescribe the rule by which commerce is governed, the rule of Gibbons v. Ogden.</text>
            <text syncTime="5098.169" offset="20400541">But to go further and say it's not just prescribing the rule for commerce that exists but is the power to compel people to enter into commerce in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="5106.858" offset="20435231">I would like to say two very brief things about the taxing power, if I could.</text>
            <text syncTime="5109.643" offset="20446412">There are lots of reasons why this isn't a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.579" offset="20454144">It wasn't denominated a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="5112.729" offset="20458741">It's not structured as a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="5114.031" offset="20463966">If it's any tax at all, though, it is a direct tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="5117.083" offset="20476191">Article I, Section 9, clause 4, the Framers would have had no doubt that a tax on not having something is not an excise tax but a forbidden direct tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="5126.172" offset="20512554">That's one more reason why this is not proper legislation because it violates that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5131.057" offset="20532093">The second thing is I would urge you to read the License Tax case which the Solicitor General says is his best case for why you ignore the fact that a tax is denominated into something other.</text>
            <text syncTime="5141.781" offset="20574934">Because that is a case where the argument was that because the Federal government had passed a license not a tax, that somehow that allowed people to take actions that would have been unlawful under State law, that this was some special Federal license to do something that was forbidden by State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5157.458" offset="20637628">This Court looked beyond the label in order to preserve federalism there.</text>

            <text syncTime="6665.119" offset="26668361">But you pointed out, and I agree with you on this, that the government set up these emergency room laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="6672.439" offset="26697618">The government set up Medicaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="6674.825" offset="26707127">The government set up Medicare.</text>
            <text syncTime="6677.177" offset="26716531">The government set up CHIP, and there are 40 million people who don't have the private insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6682.712" offset="26738683">In that world, the government has set up commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="6686.533" offset="26753938">It's all over the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6688.349" offset="26761252">And in that world, of course, the decision by the 40 million not to buy the insurance affects that commerce, and substantially so.</text>
            <text syncTime="6699.590" offset="26806183">So I thought the issue here is not whether it's a violation of some basic right or something to make people buy things they don't want, but simply whether those decisions of that group of 40 million people substantially affect the interstate commerce that has been set up in part through these other programs.</text>

            <text syncTime="6808.478" offset="27241801">One of the issues here is not only that they're compelling us to enter into the marketplace, they're not -- they're prohibiting us from buying the only economically sensible product that we would want.</text>

            <text syncTime="6820.619" offset="27290284">Everyone agrees the only potential problem that a 30-year-old, as he goes from the healthy 70 percent of the population to the unhealthy 5 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6829.558" offset="27326124">And yet Congress prohibits anyone over 30 from buying any kind of catastrophic health insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6835.629" offset="27350366">And the reason they do that is because they needed this massive subsidy.</text>

            <text syncTime="6849.520" offset="27405954">So, Justice Kennedy, even if we were going to create exceptions for people that are outside of commerce and inside of commerce, surely we'd make Congress do a closer nexus and say look, we're really addressing this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="6860.327" offset="27449109">We want these 30-year-olds to get catastrophic health insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6864.731" offset="27466767">And not only did they -- they deprived them of that option.</text>
            <text syncTime="6868.100" offset="27480247">And I think that illustrates the dangers of giving Congress these plenary powers, because they can always leverage them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6873.254" offset="27500831">They can always come up with some public policy rationale that converts the power to regulate commerce into the power to promote commerce, which, as I was saying before, is the one that I think is plenary.</text>

            <text syncTime="6885.478" offset="27549732">Mr. Carvin, a large part of this argument has concerned the question of whether certain kinds of people are active participants in a market or not active participants in a market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6896.583" offset="27594141">In your test, which is a test that focuses on this activity/inactivity distinction, would force one to confront that problem all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6905.023" offset="27627891">Now, if you look over the history of the Commerce Clause, what you see is that there were sort of unhappy periods when the Court used tests like this -- direct versus indirect, commerce versus manufacturing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6919.533" offset="27685987">I think most people would say that those things didn't really work.</text>
            <text syncTime="6922.751" offset="27698839">And the question is, why should this test, inactive versus active, work any better?</text>

            <text syncTime="6928.305" offset="27721096">The problem you identify is exactly the problem you would create if you bought the government's bogus limiting principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="6935.058" offset="27748054">You'd have to draw distinctions between the insurance industry and the car industry and all of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6939.029" offset="27763936">We turn you to the Commerce Clause jurisprudence that bedeviled the Court before the 1930s, where they were drawing all these kinds of distinctions among industries; whereas our test is really very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="6950.004" offset="27807822">Are you buying the product or is Congress compelling you to buy the product?</text>
            <text syncTime="6953.539" offset="27822033">I can't think of a brighter line.</text>
            <text syncTime="6955.156" offset="27828511">And again, if Congress has the power to compel you to buy this product, then obviously, they have got the power to provide you -- to compel you to buy any product, because any purchase is going to benefit commerce, and this Court is never going to second-guess Congress's policy judgments on how important it is this product versus that product.</text>

            <text syncTime="6987.743" offset="27958810">And again, it's a distinction that comes, Justice Kagan, directly from the text of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="6992.580" offset="27978141">The Framers consciously gave Congress the ability to regulate commerce, because that's not a particularly threatening activity that deprives you of individual freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="7000.936" offset="28011577">If you were required, if you were authorized to require A to transfer property to B, you have, as the early cases put it, a monster in legislation which is against all reason in justice, because everyone intuitively understands that regulating people who voluntarily enter into contracts in setting changing conditions does not create the possibility of Congress compelling wealth transfers among the citizenry.</text>
            <text syncTime="7024.551" offset="28106036">And that is precisely why the Framers denied them the power to compel commerce, and precisely why they didn't give them plenary power.</text>

            <text syncTime="7037.123" offset="28156296">Congress confronted a grave problem when it enacted the Affordable Care Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="7044.146" offset="28184403">The 40 million Americans who can't get health insurance and suffered often very terrible consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="7051.466" offset="28213661">Now, we agree, I think -- everyone arguing this case agrees that Congress could remedy that problem by imposing the insurance requirement at the point of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="7059.988" offset="28247829">That won't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="7062.190" offset="28256606">The reason it won't work is because people will still show up at the hospital or at their physician's office seeking care without insurance, causing the cost shifting problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="7072.379" offset="28297357">And Mr. Clement's suggestion that they can be signed up for a high risk pool at that point is utterly unrealistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="7077.700" offset="28318673">Think about how much it would cost to get the insurance when you are at the hospital or at the doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="7084.187" offset="28344586">It would be -- it would be unfathomably high, that will never work.</text>
            <text syncTime="7088.223" offset="28360782">Congress understood that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7089.925" offset="28367574">It chose a means that will work.</text>
            <text syncTime="7092.460" offset="28377710">The means that it saw work in the States and in the State of Massachusetts and that, and that it had every reason to think would work on a national basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="7103.148" offset="28420446">That is the kind of choice of means that McCulloch says that the Constitution leaves to the democratically accountable branches of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="7112.873" offset="28459316">There is no temporal limitation in the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="7115.992" offset="28471855">Everyone subject to this regulation is in or will be in the health care market.</text>
            <text syncTime="7122.646" offset="28498395">They are just being regulated in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="7125.348" offset="28509262">That's exactly the kind of thing that ought to be left to the judgment of Congress and the democratically accountable branches of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="7132.252" offset="28536847">And I think this is actually a paradigm example of the kind of situation that Chief Justice Marshall envisioned in McCulloch itself, that the provisions of the Constitution needed to be interpreted in a manner that would allow them to be effective in addressing the great crises of human affairs that the Framers could not even envision.</text>
            <text syncTime="7153.867" offset="28623261">But if there is any doubt about that under the Commerce Clause, then I urge this Court to uphold the minimum coverage provision as an exercise of the taxing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="7165.425" offset="28669550">Under New York v. United States, this is precisely a parallel situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7170.377" offset="28689298">If the Court thinks there is any doubt about the ability of Congress to impose the requirement in 5000A(a), it can be treated as simply the predicate to which the tax incentive of 5000A(b) seeks accomplishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="7186.802" offset="28755022">And the Court -- as the Court said in New York, has a solemn obligation to respect the judgments of the democratically accountable branches of government, and because this statute can be construed in a manner that allows it to be upheld in that way, I respectfully submit that it is this Court's duty to do so.</text>
