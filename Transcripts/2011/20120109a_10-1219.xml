            <text syncTime="5.987" offset="131448">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="9.356" offset="144927">Section 145 of the Patent Act permits a person who has sought a patent from the PTO and believes that the agency has wrongly denied his application to seek judicial review of that decision in district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.413" offset="193097">The Federal Circuit in this case held that the plaintiff in a section 145 action may obtain a more favorable standard of review, de novo review, by flouting the PTO's rules during the examination process.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.821" offset="242730">Under the court's approach a plaintiff may present to the court material new evidence that he refused or failed without cause to present to the PTO.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.993" offset="279406">And as his reward, he is given de novo review of the PTO's expert determinations on all of the relevant issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.331" offset="304797">For three reasons that unprecedented regime should not be allowed to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.551" offset="321724">First, principles of administrative deference and exhaustion require that the PTO be given the opportunity to apply its expert judgment to all of the reasonably available evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.073" offset="363729">For that reason, section 145 should be interpreted as a safety valve proceeding that permits applicants to introduce evidence to the court that they reasonably could not have presented to the PTO.</text>

            <text syncTime="94.943" offset="487236">--No, the Federal Circuit has held that in those cases substantial evidence review applies, and where the Federal Circuit gets that is this Court's case in Morgan v. Daniels.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.199" offset="528300">That was an action under section 145's predecessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.166" offset="540108">There was no new evidence in that case and the Court held that this was a proceeding in the nature of a suit to set aside a judgment, the judgment of the expert agency which had made a determination, and that therefore, because this was administrative review, a deferential standard of review should apply.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="134.051" offset="643657">But the Morgan case involved -- it wasn't a contest between the PTO and the would-be patent holder; it was an interference proceeding, wasn't it?</text>

            <label>Ms. Ginger D.  Anders</label>
            <text syncTime="148.625" offset="701962">That is correct, Justice Ginsburg, it was an interference proceeding, and that's because at the time section 145's predecessor applied equally to interferences and to ex parte patent denials.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.081" offset="739788">But the Court's reasonings, its discussion of -- of the predecessor statute, did not distinguish based on the facts that this was an interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.568" offset="769776">And also this Court--</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="166.837" offset="774792">I thought that -- it's interesting that the language of Morgan and one of its companion cases, not companion in the sense of being heard at the same time, but on the same issue -- the Radio City case -- both of them don't talk in the language of today.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.612" offset="837904">They don't talk about deference, they don't talk about substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.250" offset="856503">They talk about whether the PTO has expertise, and presumptions that their fact findings based on their expertise have to be overcome with some convincing evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.260" offset="916480">So they are talking in different language, but the concept they are talking about is one where the Court does accept findings of the PTO on the matters that involve their expertise, and give them weight -- substantial weight, essentially.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.923" offset="999131">And only overturn it if the Court is, in the words of Morgan and Radio City, "thoroughly convinced" that they were wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.314" offset="1044689">So what's wrong with that standard?</text>
            <text syncTime="236.714" offset="1054302">Everybody likes the deference language of today, but they were very clear in what they were saying: If the PTO made a finding, you decide whether that finding was based on its expertise, and if it was, you don't change it, court, unless you are thoroughly convinced they were wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.477" offset="1133401">Is there anything wrong with that?</text>
            <text syncTime="258.596" offset="1141864">With that articulation of what the standard should be in all situations, whether there is new evidence or no new evidence?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ginger_d__anders" startTime="267.885" stopTime="309.909">
            <label>Ms. Ginger D.  Anders</label>
            <text syncTime="267.885" offset="1178958">--Well, I think here we are suggesting that in -- in 145 actions when there is new evidence the Morgan "thorough conviction" standard should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.974" offset="1215321">That reflects the fact that the court needs to look at the new evidence, but because the PTO has made an expert determination, as the Court said in Morgan, that determination should not be overturned unless there is a high degree of certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.430" offset="1261192">And I would note that that is essentially what this Court did just last term in Microsoft v. i4i.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.067" offset="1283762">There the Court said that when a third party is challenging the validity of a granted patent, that the third party should have to show invalidity based on a heightened burden of proof, clear and convincing evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.290" offset="1332663">And that reflects the same wisdom that -- that underlies--</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="309.909" offset="1347082">Let me tell you what my problem is with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.128" offset="1359935">It is the issue that Verizon raised, and the lack of connection between the district court's holding and the circuits court holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.086" offset="1403820">The district court excluded the affidavit for the proposed arguments on the basis of them being new arguments that board rules precluded them from raising at the stage they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.978" offset="1471425">The circuit court described the affidavit as new evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.284" offset="1496607">And the Verizon amicus brief says: Court, be careful, because it's not really clear what's new evidence in this affidavit and what's new argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.759" offset="1550524">And that question troubles me, for the following reason: Verizon posits that the issue of whether a description is specific enough is a legal question to which the PTO is not entitled to deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.338" offset="1636833">Why, other than Federal Circuit and Patent Board precedent, is that right?</text>
            <text syncTime="391.980" offset="1675389">And can you explain why this affidavit that was rejected is in fact new evidence and not merely new argument?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ginger_d__anders" startTime="405.054" stopTime="438.525">
            <label>Ms. Ginger D.  Anders</label>
            <text syncTime="405.054" offset="1727634">--Certainly, Justice Sotomayor.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.006" offset="1739442">I think that the district court did characterize this as new evidence, and the reason it did that is because Mr. Hyatt made a concerted strategic decision here to present his affidavit as new evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.212" offset="1784268">In form this is -- this is factual evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.314" offset="1792731">This is a declaration containing proffer testimony that Mr. Hyatt would offer if there were a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.800" offset="1814674">So it is in form factual evidence, and in order to take advantage of the possibility of introducing new evidence in the section 145 action, Mr. Hyatt argued that this is new factual evidence that should--</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="438.525" offset="1861590">Could you tell me what -- other than it's in the form of an affidavit, tell me what in the content was new evidence?</text>
            <text syncTime="444.512" offset="1885518">I want to get away from the labels and I want to get to the substance, because I've looked at all of these submissions and it sounds like what I read in the briefs every day.</text>

          <turn speaker="ginger_d__anders" startTime="453.718" stopTime="566.890">
            <label>Ms. Ginger D.  Anders</label>
            <text syncTime="453.718" offset="1922299">--Certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.018" offset="1927523">I think whether or not the -- the ultimate question of whether the written description is sufficient is a question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.141" offset="1952078">It would be one that rests on several subsidiary fact findings, including what the ordinary skill in the art is, what a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand when he reads the specification, and where in the specification there is support, there is description support, for the claims that shows that Mr. Hyatt possessed the invention that he claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.452" offset="2033267">And so I think when you look at what happened at the PTO, the examiner said: Despite my expertise, I can't tell where in the specification your claims are supported.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.326" offset="2076735">This is at 258 -- it's a 250-page specification reprinted in the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.997" offset="2103484">It has over 100 pages of diagrams of source code and 117 claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.734" offset="2126367">And so the PTO asked for this information; Mr. Hyatt refused to present it or he didn't present it, and then on rehearing the board said that he had not had any cause not to present his new -- this new argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.060" offset="2179657">And so at that point Mr. Hyatt went into the 145 proceeding and he was -- he characterized this as factual evidence in order to get around, presumably, or it would be reasonable to try to get around, the board's ruling that he couldn't present new evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.570" offset="2237753">Now you certainly could characterize this as legal argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.105" offset="2251860">We believe that we would win on that ground as well, even if this were new argument, because certainly the PTO is entitled to enforce its rules here, and both the district court and the panel found that the PTO did not abuse its discretion in -- in holding that Mr. Hyatt had forfeited his right to raise this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.166" offset="2328137">But that's not -- that's not an additional question presented that we -- that we added here because it's a very case-specific question.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.236" offset="2352379">But at any rate the -- the entire case has now been litigated on the basis of this being factual evidence--</text>

            <text syncTime="1185.825" offset="4850730">In other words, they would give consideration to the fact that it wasn't introduced and asked, and maybe discount it as a result, unless there is a reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="1488.553" offset="6061662">I'm relying that the legislative history is replete with the commissioner of patents himself saying that section 145 required de novo review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.111" offset="6107951">And witness after witness tried to argue for Congress to change it, and it didn't, arguing that it required de novo review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.050" offset="6143687">Second, our cases repeatedly describe it as de novo review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1517.573" offset="6177750">And then you got to get past that between 1927 and 1945 you have Barrett on your side.</text>

            <text syncTime="1549.842" offset="6306795">--I think the record does support our argument, Justice Sotomayor, because what you see in the early twentieth century after Morgan had construed this as administrative review -- you referred to the 1927 hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.667" offset="6354129">There, I think many of the people used the phrase APA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.040" offset="6391641">They referred to it mostly as the -- as a contrast between the original action and the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.861" offset="6414942">And that's the same thing you see in the early cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.480" offset="6425391">For instance, Globe-Union referred to this as a de novo proceeding, even as it said that the thorough conviction standard should apply and -- and new evidence should be limited because this was administrative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.519" offset="6465515">So I don't think you can place very much weight on the use of the term "de novo".</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.704" offset="6478263">I do think it is notable that every time there was an objection in the cases before 1952, the courts applied limitations on new evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.810" offset="6510759">Dowling, the case you referred to, that was dicta; the Court discussed the standard but didn't actually apply it there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.464" offset="6537300">And so I think the most natural inference is that in 1952, Congress looked to Morgan and it looked to these cases, and it viewed this as an administrative review proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2589.650" offset="10466116">Globe-Union said that, so even the cases that the government itself relied on were accepted evidence, despite the arguments that were made by the defendants in those cases that this was evidence that should have been excluded because it could have been presented.</text>

            <text syncTime="2616.051" offset="10571651">And the critical point that this Court recognized in Microsoft was that Morgan is one of the early cases and then -- and Radio Corporation is another that depend on an idea of the presumption of validity, which of course was then adopted by Congress in section 282 as a statutory presumption, that was given that common law meaning that required clear and convincing evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.766" offset="10670498">But the clear and convincing evidence is to overcome the grant of a property right to the defendant in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.987" offset="10695367">What is critical in Morgan is the fact that the Patent Office had granted a patent to the defendant and it was a challenge to the validity of that patent that the plaintiff's case relied on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.013" offset="10755553">And it's -- and that's absolutely clear because the court cites to Johnson v. Towsley which is a case involving a land grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.185" offset="10792229">And what the Court says is, our presumption is when the executive has the power to give property rights, we don't get a to review it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.974" offset="10823367">Now in this case we see a limited exception, because there is a statute that actually tells us we have to do it, but that exception is going to be limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.647" offset="10854087">But if you look at what Morgan relies on, Morgan is not relying on agency expertise; it's relying on agency authority, which is a different matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2726.105" offset="11011866">There had been no rights granted by the executive department, and there is a new proceeding in which, to quote Professor Merrill's article,</text>

            <text syncTime="3068.009" offset="12379533">And every single one -- every single one -- of those grounds for rejection was overcome in the appeal before the Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="3098.029" offset="12499592">So where the applicant was provided a fair opportunity to try to meet the concerns, the applicant did so, and the Board ruled in his favor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3136.504" offset="12653505">And even if there were uncertainty as to what the precise standard for admissibility was, the applicants would have every reason to test that, and to -- to try to do something along that line if that were a realistic option and favorable.</text>

            <label>Ms. Ginger D.  Anders</label>
            <text syncTime="3278.346" offset="13220885">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.981" offset="13235409">This is an action for judicial review of agency determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.202" offset="13252232">This is an action that requires the patent applicant to -- to seek a property right from the agency, to have it denied, and to challenge that in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.225" offset="13284415">And as a result, this Court said in Zurko that this is review of an agency determination, and therefore, Morgan's deferential standard should be carried forward into the APA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.414" offset="13325166">And in construing Morgan, the Court in Zurko did not consider that it was -- whether a property right had been awarded or not; it was simply that the agency had made a determination in its expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.304" offset="13368633">And I think that goes to why it would not be sufficient for the Court simply to weigh the evidence differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.458" offset="13393293">In every other agency -- judicial review proceeding of actions, the rule is that the agency is the primary decisionmaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.529" offset="13421610">The agency has to consider the evidence first and make a determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.314" offset="13436761">That aids judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.600" offset="13441881">It allows the agency to apply its expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.302" offset="13452643">And we generally don't think of the Court as being the one who should make the first determination on issues of fact.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3341.789" offset="13474586">Seems you have a strange statute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.272" offset="13484513">I don't know any statute that -- that reads this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.359" offset="13496947">"As the facts" -- "as the facts" -- where is it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.042" offset="13507605">"As the facts may" --</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.061" offset="13511680">"as the facts in the case may appear. "</text>

            <label>Ms. Ginger D.  Anders</label>
            <text syncTime="3359.833" offset="13546789">Well, that language was in the statute in Morgan when the Court construed this as judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.635" offset="13566015">And I think that -- there would have to be a compelling reason in order to interpret the statute to permit an agent -- the applicant -- to introduce evidence that he failed without cause -- without justification to provide to the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.497" offset="13629440">And I don't think that Mr. Hyatt has shown any such justification.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="3383.616" offset="13641979">Well, but I guess the compelling reason is the statutory language, and especially with respect to the admissibility of evidence question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.436" offset="13669251">I mean, it -- the standard that you suggest just can't be derived from the statutory language, isn't that right?</text>

            <label>Ms. Ginger D.  Anders</label>
            <text syncTime="3397.875" offset="13698926">Well, I think certainly there is an exhaustion requirement within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.327" offset="13712823">The Board has to have considered the application, and therefore, it would make no sense to have the Board consider the application if it didn't have to consider all of the evidence that was provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.433" offset="13753156">So I think in that sense, you know, the standard that the Federal Circuit put in place and that Mr. Hyatt is proposing really is providing--</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="3418.706" offset="13782309">But why doesn't the Court just say what you said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.908" offset="13795056">If it's -- not the Court, Congress -- if you admit that Congress intended a section 145 action to permit new evidence, if it wanted to limit that evidence to something that could not have been found with due diligence or whatever your limitations are, why did it speak more broadly?</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.087" offset="13879798">I mean, the statutory language suggests as PTO.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.677" offset="13918145">As law -- "as equity might permit".</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.931" offset="13935177">This is very broad language.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Ms. Ginger D.  Anders</label>
            <text syncTime="3458.231" offset="13940402">--Well, the language could be taken to suggest that some new evidence is admissible, but I think then we look to the fact that this -- just like Section 141 is a judicial review proceeding and there has to be compelling reason before we deviate from the normal deferential standards that apply when a -- when a court is reviewing an agency's determination.</text>
