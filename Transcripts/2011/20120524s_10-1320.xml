            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="107520">I have our opinion this morning in case 10-1320, Blueford versus Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.416" offset="137091">The Double Jeopardy Clause, as a general matter, prohibits trying someone twice for the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.758" offset="162482">It has long been established, however, that a person maybe tried again if the jury could not agree on a verdict at his first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.762" offset="194560">If a jury cannot reach a verdict, the judge declares what is known as a mistrial and the prosecution gets to decide whether to retry the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.167" offset="232176">Now, in this case the State of Arkansas charged petitioner, Alex Blueford, with capital murder for the death of one-year-old child.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.977" offset="267389">That charge included the lesser offenses of first-degree murder, manslaughter, and negligent homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.781" offset="294557">In other words, the jury could convict Blueford of anyone of those offenses depending on its view of the evidence and whether it thought the prosecution had carried its burden of proof on the particular elements that went with each offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.181" offset="352235">At trial, the court instructed the jury, when deliberating, to consider the offenses in order, from greater to lesser.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.351" offset="380865">Thus, the jury was told to begin with capital murder then if the jury had a reasonable doubt about whether Blueford was guilty of capital murder, to go on to first-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.239" offset="420467">Next, if the jury had a reasonable doubt on first-degree murder to go on to manslaughter, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.100" offset="443873">The court also presented the jury with a set of verdict forms which allowed the jury either to convict Blueford of one of the charged offenses or to acquit him of all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.553" offset="485669">Acquitting on some, but not others was not an option.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.984" offset="503432">After deliberating for a few hours, the jury reported that it could not reach a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.402" offset="525061">The court inquired about the jury's progress on each offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.261" offset="540526">The foreperson said that the jury was unanimous against guilt on the charges of capital murder and first-degree murder, was deadlocked on manslaughter, and had not voted on negligent homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.945" offset="591203">The Court told the jury to continue to deliberate.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.443" offset="605205">The jury did so but still could not reach a verdict and the court declared a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.112" offset="627879">The State subsequently sought to retry Blueford.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.403" offset="641045">Everybody agrees that he may be retried on charges of manslaughter and negligent homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.878" offset="662988">The question is whether he may also be retried on charges of capital and first-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.043" offset="687647">Blueford says he can't be, because the foreperson's report that the jury was unanimous against guilt on capital and first-degree murder represented an acquittal on those charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.024" offset="739579">That report, however, was not a final resolution of anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.409" offset="757133">When the foreperson told the Court how the jury had voted on each offense, the jury's deliberations had not yet concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.480" offset="789420">The jurors in fact went back to the jury room to deliberate further and nothing in the Court's instructions prohibited them from reconsidering their earlier votes as deliberations continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.593" offset="837799">The foreperson's report prior to the end of deliberations, therefore, lacked the finality necessary to amount to an acquittal on capital and first-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.110" offset="879909">Blueford's other reason for why he can't be retried is that the trial court's declaration of a mistrial was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.617" offset="909897">Blueford contends that there was no necessity for a mistrial on capital and first-degree murder given that the foreperson's report that the jury had voted unanimously against guilt on those charges meant that he had been acquitted on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.529" offset="973636">At that -- according to Blueford at that time, the court should have allowed the jury to give effect to those votes and then considered a mistrial only as to the remaining charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.521" offset="1017522">But as permitted under Arkansas law, the jury's options in this case were limited to two, either convict on one of the offenses or acquit on all.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.362" offset="1056914">The jury in this case was unable to do either and the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to add another option, that of acquitting on some offenses but not others.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.711" offset="1106338">The jury in this case did not convict Blueford of any offense, but it did not acquit him of any either.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.767" offset="1134550">When the jury was unable to return a verdict, the trial court properly declared a mistrial and discharged the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.647" offset="1162031">As a consequence, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not stand in the way of a second trial on the same offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.237" offset="1188467">The judgment of the Supreme Court of Arkansas is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.898" offset="1203096">Justice Sotomayor has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Ginsburg and Kagan join.</text>
