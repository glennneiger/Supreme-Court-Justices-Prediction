            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="108544">Justice Ginsburg has our opinion in Case Number 11-159, Astrue versus Capato.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="8.504" offset="142503">This case concerns the entitlement of children conceived after the death of their father to Social Security survivor's benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.916" offset="188165">To qualify as a survivor of a deceased wage earner, a child so conceived, like child applicants generally, must be eligible to inherit from the insured under state intestacy law.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.300" offset="249710">That standard was not met in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.404" offset="262144">The children in question are twins conceived through in vitro fertilization using deceased wage earner, Robert Capato's frozen sperm.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.712" offset="307388">They were born 18 months after his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.044" offset="324629">The Social Security Administration denied an application for benefits filed on the twins' behalf by their mother, Karen Capato, widow of the wage earner.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.026" offset="372590">The reason for the denial, Robert Capato died domiciled in Florida, and under that state law, children conceived after a parent's death do not qualify for intestate succession.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.285" offset="437582">On judicial review, the Federal District Court affirmed the denial of benefits, the Court of Appeals for the third Circuit however reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.288" offset="477602">It held that biological children of married parents are survivors entitled to benefits without regard to state intestacy law.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.288" offset="521592">The governing Social Security provisions state first in 42 U.S.C. Section 402(d) that benefits are payable to every child as defined in Section 416(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="117.552" offset="578748">416(e) in turn defines child, as relevant here, to mean the child of an insured individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.372" offset="617932">A subsequent provision, Section 416(h)(2)(A), adds in determining whether an applicant is the child of an insured individual for purposes of this subchapter, the Commissioner of Social Security shall apply the intestacy law of the insured individual's domiciliary State.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.829" offset="715839">Respondent Karen Capato, in line with the Third Circuit, relies on the initial definition of child in 416(e), child means the child of an insured individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.781" offset="771636">Because the Capato twins are undeniably the children of Robert and Karen Capato, the Third Circuit reasoned they met before 416(e) definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.024" offset="816567">There was no cause to refer to 416(h), the Court explained, for that Section is labeled determination of family status when, as in this case, claimants of the biological children of a married couple the Court said, there is no family status to determine so for 416(e) alone controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.360" offset="921893">But the Social Security Administration found that one must read on beyond 416(e) to determine who is a child for survivor's benefit purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.698" offset="967241">Section 416(h) states explicitly that the definitions therein contained apply to the entire subchapter, including 416(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="227.252" offset="1017501">In other words, the 416(e) tautological definition, "child" means child is completed in 416(h) which instructs that the Capato twins could gain benefits only if they were entitled to inherit under the intestacy law of their father's domicile at death.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.496" offset="1098480">We agree that Section 416(h) serves as a gateway through which all applicants for benefits as a child must pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.208" offset="1141321">Resort to state law on matters of family status is common in the Social Security Act, notably, the Act refers to state law to determine an applicant status as a wife, widow, husband or widower.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.811" offset="1199731">The Act also sets several duration of relationship limitations and durational limits are also found in state statutes that accord inherit into rights to children conceived after their father's death.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.040" offset="1260648">In contrast, under the Court of Appeals' reading, biological children of married parents can gain benefits even if their father died many years before their birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.142" offset="1313102">Reliance on state intestacy law to determine who is a child for survivor's benefit purposes, serves Congress' main aim to protect dependent members of wage earner's family against the hardship occasioned by the loss of the insured earning.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.664" offset="1387186">As this Court explained in prior case where state intestacy law provides that a child may take personal property from a father's estate, it may reasonably meet that what that the child were more likely be dependent during the parent's life and at his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.425" offset="1458239">In sum, we find the Social Security Administration's reading better attuned to the statute's text and its design to benefit primarily those that deceased wage earner actually supported in his or her lifetime and even if the agency's long standing interpretation is not the only reasonable one, it is at least a permissible construction entitled to deference under our decision in Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.868" offset="1595956">For the reasons stated spelled out in detail in the Court's opinion, we reverse the Third Circuit's judgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.191" offset="1625213">The opinion is unanimous.</text>
