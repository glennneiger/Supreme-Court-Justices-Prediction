            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="105472">Justice Kennedy has our opinion this morning in Case 10-945, Florence versus The Board of Chosen Freeholders.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="7.380" stopTime="338.651">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="7.380" offset="134938">In this Case, the Court considers the extent to which the Constitution imposes restrictions on jail officials who search incoming detainees.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.840" offset="172763">The petitioner is Albert Florence and he presses claims for himself and a larger class.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.641" offset="191990">In 1998, Florence was arrested after attempting to flee from police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.145" offset="214037">He pled guilty to two offenses and was sentenced by a New Jersey state court to pay a fine in installments.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.261" offset="242458">When he fell behind on his payments and failed to appear, a judge issued a warrant for his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.826" offset="268685">Florence then paid the balance but the warrant remained in a state-wide computer database.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.404" offset="295016">Some seven years later, the events that give rise to this case occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.878" offset="312884">Florence and his wife were stopped in their car by a New Jersey state trooper.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.782" offset="328558">Based on the outstanding warrant, Florence was arrested and taken to the Burlington County Detention Center.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.908" offset="353008">He was held there for six days and then transferred to the Essex County Correctional Center.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.737" offset="376414">He was released a day later after the charges were dropped.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.538" offset="391565">At the outset of his detention in each of the two facilities, Florence was subjected to a thorough -- thorough search, sometimes called a strip search.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.859" offset="428868">The searches did not involve any touching or probing of the unclothed detainee, yet the two searches were thorough and no doubt intrusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.430" offset="463141">At the Burlington Facility, jail policy required every arrestee to shower with a delousing soap.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.221" offset="486337">Officers would check for scars, gang tattoos and contraband as the arrestee or detainee disrobed.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.567" offset="515699">Florence claims he was also instructed to open his mouth, lift his tongue, hold out his arms, turn around and lift his genitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.288" offset="542553">After being transferred to the Essex Facility, he was subject to a second similar search and the details are set out in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.941" offset="573168">Florence alleges that during this second search, he was required to lift his genitals, turn around and cough in a squatting position.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.991" offset="605351">Florence brought a Section 1983 suit for violations of his Fourteenth and Fourth Amendment rights alleging an awful search.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.106" offset="637848">He maintained that persons arrested for a minor offense cannot be required to remove their clothing and submit to a close visual inspection as a routine part of the intake process.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.097" offset="681838">Rather he contends officials make -- conduct this kind of search only if they have reason to suspect a particular inmate of concealing a weapon or drugs or concealing other contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.726" offset="728336">The District Court agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.424" offset="735128">The United States Court Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.668" offset="748084">It held that a search -- that the search procedures at issue struck a reasonable balance between inmate privacy and the needs of the two jails.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.716" offset="780267">This Court now affirms the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.452" offset="795209">The difficulties of operating a detention center must not be under estimated by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.405" offset="815062">Jail officials have a responsibility to ensure the security of their facilities when detainees are admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.359" offset="842856">This is not an easy task. Jails admit 13 million inmates a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.751" offset="864381">Now, the largest facilities process hundreds of people everyday, even smaller jails can be crowded on weekend nights or after a large police operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.725" offset="904296">Some detainees are gang members, others may have contagious infection, and some of them possess a knife or drugs or other contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.540" offset="931568">Correctional officers have discretion to use their expertise to devise reasonable solutions to the problems they face.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.424" offset="963124">Now, the precedents of this Court have established that deference was given to the judgment of correctional officers that these thorough searches serve not only to discover but also to deter the smuggling of contraband into detention facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.764" offset="1020489">The cases have recognized that this deterrence depends in part on the ability to conduct search without predictable exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.790" offset="1052568">It is true that some people are held in jail for a minor offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.000" offset="1069390">And Florence argues they should be exempt from the general search policies here at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.257" offset="1086422">He argues that absent a reasonable suspicion, officers should be prohibited from conducting a so-called strip search of someone who is not been arrested for an offense that involves a weapon or drugs or as otherwise considered serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.888" offset="1140966">It is reasonable, however, for correctional officials to find this framework unworkable, but one thing, people detained for a minor offense can turn out to be the most dangerous criminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.118" offset="1185896">Timothy McVeigh was stopped for a traffic offense before it was determined he was a perpetrator of the Oklahoma City bombing.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.112" offset="1217870">And there are many examples of people arrested for minor offenses, trying to bring contraband into jail, sometimes by using their body cavities.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.980" offset="1249322">In fact, an exception for the standard search protocol for minor offenders would increase the risk of their being coerced by others into hiding prohibited items.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.320" offset="1290700">Another problem is that it may be difficult to classify inmates by their current and prior offenses before the intake search.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.410" offset="1319016">Criminal history records may be inaccurate, incomplete or difficult to obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.984" offset="1337407">And even with all the facts, it could be difficult for officers to know on the spot whether a prior offense is a constitutional matter serious enough to authorize the searches here.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.100" offset="1373769">The Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments do not require the restrictions Florence proposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.274" offset="1390488">The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.034" offset="1405534">Justice Thomas has joined all but Part IV of the Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.504" offset="1419431">The Chief Justice and Justice Alito have filed concurring opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.281" offset="1434582">Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan join.</text>
