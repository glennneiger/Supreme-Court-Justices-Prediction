            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="107520">In Case Number 10-9646, Miller versus Alabama and the related case, 10-9647, Jackson versus Hobbs, Justice Kagan has the opinion.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="11.289" offset="152660">In each of these two cases, a 14-year old was convicted of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.035" offset="171572">Petitioner Kuntrell Jackson was convicted on a felony murder theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.609" offset="189858">He accompanies two other boys to a video store to commit a robbery, and one of those boys shot the store clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.520" offset="221518">Petitioner Evan Miller was convicted of murder in the course of arson.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.707" offset="238341">He and a friend beat Miller's neighbor with a bat and then set fire to his trailer after an evening of drinking and drug use with the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.048" offset="275644">Both boys were sentenced to life imprisonment without any possibility of parole under statutes that made that sentence mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.016" offset="315559">We hold today that mandatory sentences of life without the possibility of parole for juveniles violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.226" offset="360385">That clause of the Eighth Amendment guarantees individuals the right to be free from excessive sanctions and that right flows from what we have called a basic perceptive justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.154" offset="404062">The punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to both the offender and the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.746" offset="434469">Two strands of precedent applying this principle lead to our holding today.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.032" offset="455576">The first line of cases has emphasized children's lesser culpability and greater capacity for change in holding that certain sentences may not constitutionally be imposed on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.570" offset="505731">In Roper v. Simmons, we held that the Eighth Amendment bars capital punishment for juveniles, and in Graham v. Florida, we concluded that the Amendment also prohibits a sentence of life without parole for a juvenile committed of -- convicted of a nonhomicide offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.196" offset="576261">Those cases demonstrate that the differences between children and adults diminish the justifications for imposing the harshest sentences on juveniles even when they commit truly terrible crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.604" offset="629864">And most fundamentally, those cases make clear that youth matters in determining the appropriateness of certain penalties, that imposition of a State's most severe penalties on juvenile offenders cannot proceed as though they were not children.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.692" offset="702276">Our decision in Graham also likened life without parole for juveniles to the death penalty itself, thus evoking a second line of our cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.111" offset="739892">In those decisions, we have required sentencing authorities to consider the characteristics of the defendant and the details of his offense before imposing the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.403" offset="785032">Those cases too repeatedly emphasized the importance of considering the mitigating qualities of youth and maturity, impulsiveness, failure to appreciate risks and consequences sometimes terrible yet inescapable family circumstances and the way all of those factors may relate to the nature of the particular crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.329" offset="868833">Here, the confluence of these lines of precedent leads to the conclusion that mandatory life without parole for juveniles violates the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.556" offset="913659">The States contend that because 29 jurisdictions make life without parole mandatory for some juveniles convicted of murder, the practice must be constitutional, we disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.573" offset="965799">Although we looked to such numbers in considering categorical bars to a punishment, in this case, we do not erect such a bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.031" offset="999549">We do not ban life without parole for juveniles.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.790" offset="1014596">We only require that a sentencer consider all relevant circumstances before imposing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.047" offset="1039673">In similar situations, this Court has not counted laws in the way the States here propose.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.558" offset="1065691">Further, the number of States that impose mandatory life without parole is actually lower than the number we considered in Graham allowing life without parole for nonhomicide crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.165" offset="1116160">There, 39 jurisdictions authorized the sentence that we held unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.946" offset="1143223">We explained in Graham and the explanation holds just as through here, that simply tallying the number of States that impose such a sentence on children presents a distorted view.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.762" offset="1190557">Most jurisdictions have never passed a law specifically addressing juvenile life without parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.250" offset="1216470">Instead, those sentences result from two separate provisions passed at separate times; one that simply allows juveniles to be transferred to adult court and another, that imposes life without parole on anyone convicted there.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.114" offset="1279896">So we cannot conclude that any given legislature has endorsed this penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.663" offset="1306122">A mandatory sentence of life without possibility of parole for juveniles precludes a sentencer from taking account of an offender's age and the wealth of characteristics and circumstances attendant to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.326" offset="1360771">Under those schemes, every juvenile receives the same sentence as every other, the 17-year old and the 14-year old and for that matter, the 10-year old, the shooter and the accomplice, the child from a stable household and the child from a chaotic and abusive one and each juvenile, including these two 14-year olds, receives the same sentence as the vast majority of adults committing identical homicide offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.494" offset="1477486">Preventing judges and juries in that way from thinking about all of the differences between children and adults and among particular children violates the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.782" offset="1530567">The judgment in both cases is reversed and remanded. Justice Breyer has filed a concurring opinion, in which Justice Sotomayor joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.325" offset="1568810">The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Scalia, Thomas and Alito join.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.634" offset="1597962">Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Scalia joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.759" offset="1622518">Justice Alito has filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Scalia joins.</text>
