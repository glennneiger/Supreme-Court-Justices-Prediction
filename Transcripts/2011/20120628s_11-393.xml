            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="109568">I have the announcement in case number 11-393, National Federation of Independent Business versus Sebelius, and the related cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.943" offset="149274">In these cases we consider claims that Congress lacked constitutional power to enact two provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.179" offset="194205">The limits on government power foremost in many American's minds are likely to be affirmative restrictions such as contained in the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.967" offset="229418">These are affirmative restrictions come into play however only where the government possesses authority to act in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.171" offset="258152">And in our federal system, the national government possess only those limited powers the constitution assigns to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.745" offset="288455">If no constitutional power authorizes Congress to pass a certain law, that law may not be enacted even if it would not violate any of the express prohibitions in the Bill of Rights or elsewhere in the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.160" offset="346133">The first provision in issue here is often referred to as the individual mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.894" offset="365046">That provision requires individuals to maintain a specified level of health insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.324" offset="386779">For many, the mandate must be satisfied by purchasing health insurance from a private company.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.693" offset="412275">Those who do not obtain the required coverage over the IRS what the Act calls, a shared responsibility of payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.686" offset="444249">The question is whether Congress has the constitutional power to enact the individual mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.710" offset="464311">The government advances two arguments that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.792" offset="476641">First, the government contends that the constitution's Commerce Clause authorizes the mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.754" offset="500569">Second, the government says that Congress could enact the statute under its constitutional power to lay and collect taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.848" offset="528886">Turning first to the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.494" offset="539544">Congress has never before attempted to use the commerce power to order individuals not engaged in commerce to buy an unwanted product.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.315" offset="574757">And nothing in the text to the constitution suggests it can.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.418" offset="591161">The Commerce Clause allows Congress to regulate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.880" offset="605059">The power to regulate commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.502" offset="631495">Our president reflects that understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.350" offset="642884">As expansive as our cases construing the commerce power have been, they all have one thing in common.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.211" offset="670365">They uniformly described the power as reaching activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.315" offset="686770">It is nearly impossible to avoid the word when quoting our cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.114" offset="709966">The individual mandate by contrast does not regulate existing activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.685" offset="728252">It instead compels individuals to become active in commerce by purchasing a product they do not want.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.082" offset="757823">The government contends that Congress can do this because the failure to purchase health insurance has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.634" offset="788020">In particular, the government focuses on the costs that the uninsured as a group impose on the healthcare system when they need care but are unable to pay for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.884" offset="829085">Allowing Congress to regulate individuals precisely because they do not do something however would vastly expand federal power.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.691" offset="864298">People for reasons of their own often fail to do things that would be good for them or for society.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.888" offset="889062">Those failures joined with the similar failures of others can have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.034" offset="917692">Under the government's logic, that authorizes Congress to compel unwilling citizens to act as the government would have them act.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.631" offset="952069">Congress already enjoys vast power to regulate much of what we do except in the government's theory would allow Congress the same license to regulate what we do not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.200" offset="994283">That would fundamentally change the relationship between the American citizen and the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.952" offset="1021346">Now, to an economist perhaps, there is no difference between activity and inactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.495" offset="1043498">Both can have measurable economic effects on commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.712" offset="1060321">But the distinction between doing something and doing nothing would not have been lost on the framers who were practical statesmen, not academic theorists.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.904" offset="1105147">The framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce not to compel it.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.035" offset="1121656">For over 200 years, this Court's decisions and Congress' actions have reflected this understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.093" offset="1145898">There is no reason to depart from it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.368" offset="1158959">But the government says that health insurance is different because everyone will eventually need healthcare.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.331" offset="1182887">According to the government, that means the uninsured even though doing nothing can be "regulated in advance."</text>
            <text syncTime="276.694" offset="1216324">That assertion is inconsistent with a limited consumption of federal power.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.074" offset="1233774">The Commerce Clause is not a general license to regulate an individual from cradle to grave simply because he will predictably engage in particular transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.467" offset="1279436">The government also contends that Congress could enact the individual mandate because the mandate is important to other parts of the Healthcare Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.307" offset="1310783">Other provisions of the Act whose validity under the Commerce Clause is not challenged here, restrict the ability of health insurance companies to charge higher prices to less healthy individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.359" offset="1358952">Those provisions will likely cause insurance companies to raise the prices they charge everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.321" offset="1378806">According to the government, the individual mandate is in the constitution's language, necessary and proper to support those provisions because it will compel healthy individuals to subsidize the cost of insuring those who are less healthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.344" offset="1438887">Our cases interpreting the necessary and proper clause have been very differential to Congress' determination of what is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.998" offset="1469503">But we have also explained that the clause is not a grant of a great and independent power.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.421" offset="1491237">The clause only allows Congress to do things that are incidental to the exercise of its other powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.693" offset="1516314">Compelling people to enter commerce precisely because they have chosen not to cannot be considered a necessary and proper supplement to the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.583" offset="1559886">There are separate writings on this subject but the majority of this Court agrees that the Commerce Clause cannot sustain the individual mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.436" offset="1599279">That brings us to the Government's second argument that the mandate maybe upheld under Congress' power to lay and collect taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.414" offset="1631148">The Government's tax power argument asks us to interpret the statute not as ordering individuals to buy insurance but rather as imposing the tax on those who go without it.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.561" offset="1671795">Under the mandate, if an individual does not buy health insurance, the only consequence is that he must make an additional payment to the IRS when he pays his taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.722" offset="1712441">The government says, that means the mandate can be interpreted as establishing a condition not only health insurance that triggers a tax, the required payment to the IRS.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.971" offset="1757372">Under that theory, the mandate makes going without insurance just another thing the government taxes like buying gasoline or earning income.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.674" offset="1792167">And if the mandate is just a tax hike on taxpayers who don't have health insurance, it may be within Congress' constitutional power to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.902" offset="1833127">Under our precedent, if there are two possible interpretations of a statute and one of those interpretations violates the constitutions -- the constitution, courts should adopt the interpretation that allows the statute to be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.574" offset="1887775">Thus, the question here isn't whether the interpretation of the statute, the Government offers to support its tax argument is the best interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.919" offset="1921212">Rather, under our cases, the question is whether that interpretation is reasonable or fairly possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.894" offset="1945140">If it is, then the Court should adopt that interpretation rather than declare the statute unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.202" offset="1978368">The payment the Act imposes on those without health insurance certainly looks like a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.678" offset="2000206">By its terms, it applies to taxpayers and is paid to the IRS when they file their tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.809" offset="2024761">It doesn't apply to individuals who don't pay federal income taxes because their income is too low.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.475" offset="2055377">For taxpayers who do know the payment, its amount is determined by factors such as taxable income, number of dependents, and joint filing status.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.880" offset="2089023">And the payment is expected to generate nearly $4 billion per year in government revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.181" offset="2114205">The Act doesn't call this payment a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.397" offset="2123086">It calls it a shared responsibility payment and a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.122" offset="2141999">But whether law is with Congress' taxing power is determined by what the statute does, not the labels Congress attaches to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.846" offset="2172928">This payment functions like a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.780" offset="2180660">It's paid by taxpayers with their to the IRS will generate a lot of government revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.015" offset="2205529">The amount of the payment also suggest it is in effect a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.038" offset="2221620">Our cases examining whether something is a tax often consider this factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.553" offset="2239697">If an exaction is high that no one could be expected voluntarily to pay it, that can show the law is really just a command enforced by a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.242" offset="2274492">The payment in this case by contrast is calibrated to the taxpayer's income, can never be higher than the cost of buying insurance and can often be quite a bit less.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.220" offset="2314407">It is indeed likely that many Americans will choose to pay the IRS rather than buying insurance and someone who makes that payment has fully complied with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.480" offset="2351397">He has not done anything unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.592" offset="2363935">The Solicitor General confirm that understanding in his briefs and at oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.289" offset="2382639">That is another reason that the statute functions more like a tax than the sort of punitive exactions we've struck down before.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.125" offset="2413986">The plaintiffs however say that because this statute uses words like shall and penalty, the law must be read to make it illegal not to buy insurance even if that would mean the law was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.768" offset="2460588">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.205" offset="2466335">An example may help show why.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.771" offset="2476575">Suppose Congress enacted a statute providing that every taxpayer who owns a house without energy efficient windows must pay $50 to the IRS.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.053" offset="2513774">The amount due is adjusted based on factors such as taxable income and joint filing status and is paid along with the taxpayer's income tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.000" offset="2549509">Those whose income is below the filing threshold need not pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.541" offset="2563720">The required payment in the hypothetical statute is not called a tax, a penalty or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.343" offset="2590887">Now, no one would doubt that this law impose a tax and was within Congress' power to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.137" offset="2614084">Now, suppose Congress used the word penalty to describe the payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.152" offset="2630175">The law would still do the exact same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.085" offset="2641878">There is no reason to conclude that it would then be outside Congress' power to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.568" offset="2667792">The plaintiffs also argue that even if the tax is interpreted even if the statute is interpreted as a tax, such a tax would violate the constitution's direct tax clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.163" offset="2710215">But as our opinion explains more fully, our precedent is clear that a tax on going without health insurance is not a direct tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.900" offset="2745114">Still, this tax is a burden that the federal government imposes for an omission, not an Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.214" offset="2770401">If the commerce power does not authorize Congress to regulate those who don't engage in commerce, perhaps the taxing power should not permit Congress to impose a tax for not doing something.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.470" offset="2815436">But we cannot accept that reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.823" offset="2824840">First and most importantly, nothing in the constitution guarantees that individuals may avoid taxation through inactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.277" offset="2858590">The Government's Commerce Clause argument asked this Court to condone a new sort of federal power ordering people not in commerce to buy an unwanted product.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.334" offset="2898819">The Government's tax power argument by contrast asks us only to determine that Congress has gone something it clearly can do and indeed often has, use tax incentives to encourage people to buy a product.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.394" offset="2959109">Upholding the statute under the taxing power does not recognize any new federal power.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.381" offset="2983037">It determines that Congress has used an existing one.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.971" offset="3001428">Moreover, Congress' ability to use its taxing power to control conduct is significantly weaker than it is under the Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.023" offset="3033610">When Congress regulates under the Commerce Clause, it can bring the full weight of the federal government to bear a command issued under the Commerce Clause can be backed by fines, imprisonment, and all the consequences of being branded a criminal such as loss of job opportunities, the right to bear arms or vote in elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.436" offset="3103305">By contrast, Congress' authority under the taxing power is limited to requiring an individual to pay money into the Federal Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.575" offset="3135801">That is of course no small thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.734" offset="3144474">But our cases have always maintained that a tax so punitive that it functions like a command exceeds Congress' taxing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.721" offset="3176448">The Affordable Care Acts requirement that certain taxpayers pay the Government for not obtaining health insurance is in effect the tax on those without insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.884" offset="3217095">Passing on the wisdom or fairness of such attacks is not our role because the constitution permits it, we must uphold it.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.664" offset="3252203">In some, a majority the Court holds that the federal government cannot use the taxing power to order people to buy health insurance but a majority also holds that the statute here maybe upheld as a tax increase on those without health insurance which is within Congress' power to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.251" offset="3326495">So this portion of the Affordable Care Act is upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.345" offset="3342900">We now turn to the second part of the Act challenge in this case often referred to as the Medicaid expansion.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.097" offset="3365888">Enacted in 1965, Medicaid offers federal funding to states to assist needy persons in obtaining medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.664" offset="3396190">In order to receive that funding, states must comply with federal rules governing matters such as who receives care and what services are provided at what cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.646" offset="3436105">The Affordable Care Act dramatically increases state obligations under Medicaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.620" offset="3455958">The current Medicaid program require states to cover only discreet categories of particularly vulnerable individuals, pregnant women, children, need families, the blind and the disable.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.311" offset="3502770">There is no mandatory coverage for most childless adults and parents receive aid only if their income is far below the federal poverty line.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.415" offset="3539132">The Medicaid expansion in contrast requires states to cover all individuals under the age of 65 within incomes below 133% of the federal poverty line.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.036" offset="3585630">And, critically for this case, if a State does not comply with the Act's new coverage requirements, it may lose not only the federal funding for the expansion but all of it's federal Medicaid funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.888" offset="3637039">The constitution Spending Clause grants Congress the power to pay the debts and provide for the general welfare of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.465" offset="3671416">Our cases have recognized limits on Congress' power to use the Spending Clause to compel the states to advance federal objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.299" offset="3702763">One of the fundamental tenets of our constitutional is that the states are independent sovereigns, not merely departments of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.568" offset="3735782">Our cases thus make clear that Congress cannot commandeer state governments to carry out federal programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.879" offset="3761068">That is true whether Congress directly commands a State to run a federal program or indirectly coerces a State to adopt the federal program as its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.630" offset="3800043">Normally, the way for states to avoid complying with conditions on federal funds they do not like is to refuse to take the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.403" offset="3831077">The states are separate and independent sovereigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.358" offset="3842988">Sometimes they have to act like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.074" offset="3853855">The Medicaid expansion however is far from a typical case.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.769" offset="3868588">Congress did not merely conditioned the new funds for implicating -- implementing the expansion on whether states agreed to expand their Medicaid programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.870" offset="3909026">Instead, Congress threatened to withhold states existing Medicaid funds if they do not comply with the expansion.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.484" offset="3939432">The states claim that this threat serves no purpose other than to force unwilling states to sign up for the new program.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.629" offset="3968063">We agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.161" offset="3974123">There is no valid reason to condition a state's existing Medicaid funds which are already being spent according to federal conditions on agreeing to the new program.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.534" offset="4011635">We examined a similar situation in a case called South Dakota versus Dole.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.619" offset="4032010">There, we did not strike down the federal law but only because the amount of money at stake was so small, less than one half of 1% of South Dakota's total budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.546" offset="4071717">Under those circumstances, we held that the threat to withdraw funds was, "relatively mild encouragement so that whether to accept the federal funds in conditions remains the prerogative of the states not merely in theory but in fact."</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.272" offset="4138590">In this case, the threat to withhold funds is more than relatively mild encouragement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.388" offset="4155099">It is a gun to the head.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.204" offset="4162309">A State that opts out of the Medicaid expansion stands to lose all of its existing Medicaid funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.713" offset="4184357">The threatened loss of over 10% of a state's overall budget leaves a State with no real option but to accept the Medicaid expansion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.522" offset="4219570">The government however claims that the Medicaid expansion is just a modification of the existing program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.978" offset="4241408">It observes that the original law contains a clause expressly reserving the right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision of the Medicaid program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.030" offset="4277666">But the Medicaid expansion is a shift in kind not merely degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.492" offset="4295534">Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid is transformed into a program to meet the healthcare needs of the entire non-elderly population with income below 133% of the poverty level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.402" offset="4343077">It is no longer a program to care for the neediest among us but rather an element of a comprehensive national plan to provide universal health insurance coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.826" offset="4384872">A state could hardly anticipate that Congress' right to alter or amend that the Medicaid program included the power to transform it so dramatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.618" offset="4419981">We thus reject the government's argument that the states agreed to this when they signed up for the original Medicaid program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.668" offset="4448193">Threatening to withdraw states' existing Medicaid funds if the states do not accept the expansion is an impermissible attempt to conscript states into the federal bureaucratic army.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.238" offset="4494482">Although there are separate writings on this issue as well, seven members of the Court agree that the Medicaid expansion violates the constitution's limits on the spending power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.198" offset="4542339">Nothing in the controlling opinion precludes Congress from offering federal funds to states to expand their Medicaid programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.679" offset="4568252">What Congress cannot do is penalized states that declined to participate in that need program by taking away their existing Medicaid funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.330" offset="4602838">The Medicaid ruling does not affect other provisions of the Affordable Care Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.456" offset="4619348">States now have a real choice whether to accept the Medicaid expansion that may affect the implementation of the Act going forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.542" offset="4647664">But, for reasons we explained in our opinion, it does not impair the Act's other provisions in such a way that we must invalidate them in whole or in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.482" offset="4691446">The Court today rules that Congress does not have the power under the Commerce Clause to enact the individual mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.673" offset="4716210">The Court goes on to rule that Congress does have such power under the Taxing Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.072" offset="4733764">Finally, the Court rules that the expansion of Medicaid in the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional to the extent, it allows the federal government to take away a state's Medicaid funds if the state does not adopt the expansion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.717" offset="4788412">Our decision today is based on our responsibility recognized in Marbury versus Madison to say what the law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.007" offset="4817565">It is not in any way based on our judgment about whether the Affordable Care Act is good policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.315" offset="4842747">That judgment is for the people acting through their representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.278" offset="4858629">It is not our job to save the people from the consequences of their political choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.522" offset="4883602">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is affirmed in part and reversed in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.436" offset="4903246">Justices Breyer and Kagan joined parts 1, 2, 3(C), and 4 of this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.951" offset="4925294">Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor joined parts 1, 2, and 3(C) and concurring the judgment with respect to part 4(B).</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.292" offset="4958730">Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito have filed a joint dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.346" offset="4982868">Justice Thomas has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.050" offset="4993735">Justice Ginsburg has filed an opinion dissenting in part in which Justice Sotomayor joins in which Justices Breyer and Kagan joined in part.</text>
