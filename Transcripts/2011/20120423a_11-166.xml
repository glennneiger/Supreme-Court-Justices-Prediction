            <text syncTime="9.022" offset="142294">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.141" offset="154728">The question presented in this case is whether a secured creditor must be allowed to credit bid when its collateral is being sold under a chapter 11 plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.578" offset="188478">The relevant section of the Bankruptcy Code plainly says no.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.215" offset="203003">Section 1129(b)(2)(A) provides that a chapter 11 plan must be fair and equitable to a secured creditor that objects to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.637" offset="236753">It then provides three alternatives that the debtor can pursue to satisfy that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.956" offset="258069">Any one of these three alternatives can be used when assets are being sold, but only one of them requires the right to credit bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.645" offset="292759">Under subsection (i), the plan must allow the creditor to retain its lien and receive payments over time, with the present value equal to the value of its collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.337" offset="331525">Under subsection (ii), the plan must allow the creditor to credit bid when its asset is being sold free of its lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.840" offset="361514">But under subsection (iii), the plan must provide the creditor with the indubitable equivalent of its secured claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.596" offset="392547">The debtors have chosen to pursue a plan, a plan sale without credit bidding under subsection (iii).</text>
            <text syncTime="78.850" offset="421595">The plain language of the statute permits that result.</text>

            <text syncTime="111.154" offset="550849">The debtor files a motion, as we did in this case, to approve bid procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.456" offset="567985">The court then determines whether those bid procedures are appropriate for the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.443" offset="587943">The sale is then conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.962" offset="598078">Then the debtor goes to plan confirmation; and, at the plan confirmation hearing, aside from establishing the 16 requirements of section 1129 for a plan to be confirmed, the debtor also seeks to confirm the results of the sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="151.481" offset="712077">In essence, it's going to be determined by what the asset's sold for, provided that the sale has generated the best possible price for the asset.</text>

            <text syncTime="499.637" offset="2104717">Choice (iii), something else which comes up in different situations, for example, a creditor who is over-secured, see, and they want to sell the piece of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.229" offset="2147140">And he says, sure, I will let you sell it, but I want something that's the equivalent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1846.061" offset="7490434">So the whole code structure is set up to protect the secured creditor against the risk of undervaluation of its claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.631" offset="7516766">And that's the section 1111(b) election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.167" offset="7526901">So section 1111(b) election allows the secured creditor who is undersecured and is afraid that their value of their property will be misvalued in a clause (i) to elect to have their entire face value of their claim treated as secured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.177" offset="7586878">So here, the lenders are owed more than $130 million.</text>

            <text syncTime="2343.184" offset="9478980">And all making us cash bid would do, assuming the secured creditors are able to come up with the cash to bid in this amount, would be to endless -- just to pointlessly cycle money into the estate, and then, if we're the winning bid, through the estate and back to us, at the risk of their siphoning off the money that really shouldn't go to anyone else because we have -- the cash collateral is these secured creditors', the hotel and the parking garage are all these secured creditors' collateral.</text>

            <text syncTime="2793.858" offset="11281638">The essence of being a secured creditor, of course, as the Court has suggested, is that the secured creditor has bargained for the right either to get its money back or to get the thing that secures its loan, to get its collateral.</text>

            <text syncTime="2852.130" offset="11514754">Now, I would like to respond to one -- one sort of assumption that has seemed to permeate the conversation here, which is that a secured creditor will always have an incentive to bid the full amount of its claim at an auction of its assets where the auction is supposed to be free of liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.054" offset="11570447">That is actually not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.323" offset="11575463">As my friend Ms. Maynard suggested, unless a bank is trying to get into the business of running a hotel or running whatever business is the collateral, the creditor will only want to take the property if it thinks it can make a profit by then turning around and selling the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.980" offset="11630111">So if there is an auction where there is a cash bid, and the creditor thinks that the value of -- the amount of the cash bid is actually a fair valuation of the property, the creditor has no incentive to bid higher than that in credit, because it has no expectation of getting more money than that when it then takes the property and turns around and sells it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.092" offset="11698552">So allowing the credit bidding won't have the effect of serving as a veto on what would be a fair sale price by a cash bidder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.698" offset="11728958">The secured creditor's incentive is only to bid up to what it -- up to what it views as the value of the property and not a penny more, because it's not trying to take the property just for the property's sake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.970" offset="11770023">In most cases it wants to take the property and then sell the property.</text>

            <text syncTime="2955.963" offset="11929997">And -- and Petitioner is certainly correct that the phrase "indubitable equivalent", an unusual phrase in the statute, that that phrase is broad enough to cover any type of disposition of a secured creditor's claim, including the sale of property free of liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.621" offset="11984645">But Congress also enacted two much more specific provisions right next to clause (iii), and in those provisions, number (i), which governs -- governs the retention of liens on -- on collateral, and number (ii), which the sale of -- the sale of collateral free of liens, there are very specific protections written into clauses (i) and clause (ii).</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.417" offset="12055907">And this Court's interpretive canon that a specific provision will trump a more general provision where both could apply would seem clearly to apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.339" offset="12087567">If a plan proposes a disposition of a claim that is addressed by a clause (i) or a clause (ii), it doesn't make any sense to allow them to strip out protections that are provided in those clauses by purporting to go under the more general standard of indubitable equivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.098" offset="12146604">That is especially true because the type of judicial valuation of the property that would take place under Petitioners' type of scheme is not guaranteed to make sure that the creditor gets what it bargained for, which is either its money or its property, but that is exactly what clause (ii), that type of auction, is guaranteed to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="3046.655" offset="12292785">Well, the type of sale contemplated in clause (ii) is essentially a liquidation of the secured creditor's lien on a property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.275" offset="12315251">And so you -- the sale would essentially liquidate the lien and then clause (ii) provides that -- that there would need to be a replacement lien on the proceeds of the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.231" offset="12355166">That replacement lien would then have to be treated under clause (i) or clause (iii).</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.199" offset="12370944">I think it's fair to say in most situations what happens is that the proceeds of the sale are handed over to the secured creditor, which is essentially a clause (iii) treatment of the lien on the proceeds, in the sense that if the lien on the proceeds is a lien on the pile of cash, if you hand over the pile of cash, you're surrendering the collateral that is securing that lien, which is the classic example of indubitable equivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.446" offset="12455998">That is one of the examples cited in the legislative history and in Judge Hand's opinion in In re Murel.</text>

            <text syncTime="3104.924" offset="12525902">But valuation is an inherently difficult undertaking, and this Court has recognized that when Congress enacted the code in 1978 it shifted the preference to move from judicial valuation towards market valuations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.129" offset="12570728">And here Congress in clause (ii) expressed its view that -- that the type of market that would value this property would include one of the most interested market participants, who is -- which is the secured creditor who has an interest in the property.</text>

            <text syncTime="3173.301" offset="12799352">I think one way that's important is that it protects -- it prevents debtors from cashing out creditors at a low value, at a point where -- in the market where the value of the property is low, because they retain the lien for the full amount.</text>
