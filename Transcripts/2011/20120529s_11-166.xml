            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Scalia has the opinion of the Court this morning in case 11-166, RadLAX Gateway Hotel versus Amalgamated Bank.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="8.834" stopTime="409.417">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="8.834" offset="141814">This case is here on certiorari to United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.089" offset="166787">In 2007, the petitioners here, RadLAX Gateway Hotel and RadLAX Gateway Deck purchased a hotel near Los Angeles International Airport, along with an adjacent lot on which they planned to build a parking structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.391" offset="244005">To finance the purchase and the improvements, they obtained a $142 million loan secured by a blanket lien on all of their assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.108" offset="290920">Respondent Amalgamated Bank here is the trustee and administrative agent for the lender.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.680" offset="325193">Building the parking structure proved more expensive than the borrowers had anticipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.105" offset="346823">Within two years, they ran out of funds and were forced to -- forced to halt construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.168" offset="375139">In August of 2009, they filed petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code at the time they owed more than $120 million on the loan with $1 million in interest accruing every month.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.310" offset="443685">Now Chapter 11 bankruptcy is implemented according to a plan, typically proposed by the debtor, which specifies how the debtor will repay its creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.290" offset="491645">If the plan meets statutory requirements, the Bankruptcy Court may confirm it.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.475" offset="516305">Certain types of plans known as “cramdown plans” maybe confirmed even if creditors object.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.630" offset="549010">Those plans must be fair and equitable and a special statutory provision, Title 11 U.S.C. Section 1129(b)(2)(A), which I will hereinafter refer to as (2)(A) for simplicity's purpose, establishes criteria for determining when that condition is met with respect to secured claims, like the one at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.629" offset="652978">The cramdown plan proposed by the RadLAX debtors envisioned sale of the hotel and the adjacent parking property at an auction and using the sale proceeds to repay the Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.838" offset="705745">The opening bid at auction would be close to $50 million dollars, substantially less than the Bank is owed.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.155" offset="739077">Of course the Bank might wish to buy the property itself if the alternative would be receiving sale proceeds that fall far short of what it believes to be the property's value.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.353" offset="787874">Under the debtor's proposed auction procedures, however, the Bank would not be allowed to bid for the property using the debt it is owed to offset the purchase price, a practice known as credit-bidding.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.494" offset="844403">Instead, the Bank would have to pony up cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.873" offset="857987">The Bankruptcy Court denied the debtor's proposal holding that the auction procedures did not comply with (2)(A)'s requirements for cramdown plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.442" offset="896230">The Seventh Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.385" offset="903962">We granted certiorari and we now affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.719" offset="921307">A Chapter 11 plan crammed down over the objection of a secured creditor must be one of three requirements in order to be fair and equitable within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.072" offset="978777">Under (2)(A), clause (i), the debtor may sell the secured property subject to the lien with the secured creditor to receive deferred cash payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.749" offset="1025484">Under clause (ii), the debtor may sell the property free and clear of the lien at a sale at which the creditor may credit-bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.918" offset="1066130">In lieu of the lien on the property the creditor receives a lien on the sale proceeds or under clause (iii), the plan may provide the secure creditor with "the indubitable equivalent" of its claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.311" offset="1135720">Here, the debtors claim to sell their property free and clear of the Bank's lien and to repay the Bank with the sales proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.390" offset="1164037">That is precisely the type of plan covered by clause (ii), except that the debtor's plan would not permit the Bank to credit-bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.259" offset="1199459">The debtor's claim that even though their plan flunks clause (ii), it may satisfy clause (iii) by providing the Bank with “the indubitable equivalent” of its secured claim in the form of cash generated by the auction.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.687" offset="1261213">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.266" offset="1267482">As we have previously explained “it is a common place of statutory construction that the specific governs the general.”</text>
            <text syncTime="299.960" offset="1306248">In a statutory scheme like the one at issue here where a general authorization and a more limited specific authorization exist side by side, regulated parties normally may not sidestep the requirements of the specific provision simply by invoking the general one.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.767" offset="1377510">Instead, as we stated in 1932, and we -- and reaffirmed as recently as 2010 “general language of a statutory provision although broad enough to include it will not be held to apply to a matter specifically dealt with in another part of the same enactment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="337.129" offset="1454937">Here, clause (ii) is a detailed provision that spells out the requirements for selling property free of liens while clause (iii) is a broadly worded provision that says nothing about such a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.664" offset="1505092">As a result, the debtors in this case must comply with the terms of clause (ii).</text>
            <text syncTime="355.660" offset="1529125">Of course the general specific canon is not an absolute rule and it can be overcome by textual indications of meaning that point the other way, but the debtors have identified no such indications here.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.842" offset="1581787">The parties have also debated the Bankruptcy Code's purposes, pre-Code practices and the pros and cons of credit-bidding.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.426" offset="1612194">None of those issues is relevant here, however, because the text of (2)(A) is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.235" offset="1635391">Although the jargon in this case is complicated, the statutory interpretation question is an easy one.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.675" offset="1661095">We hold that the debtors may not obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 cramdown plan that provides for the sale of collateral free and clear of the Bank's lien, but does not permit the Bank to credit-bid at the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.083" offset="1710728">The Court's decision is unanimous except for Justice Kennedy who took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
