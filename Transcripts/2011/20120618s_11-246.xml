            <text syncTime="6.406" offset="134144">Justice Kagan has the opinion of the Court.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="9.588" offset="146892">This is a case about sovereign immunity and prudential standing, maybe not what you've all come for today.[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="18.760" offset="183568">The question is whether to allow a suit brought by respondent, David Patchak to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.006" offset="208541">Respondent Patchak owns property in rural Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.448" offset="226304">He brought suit when the Department of Interior acquired property for an Indian tribe, the Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Potawatomi Indians to enable them to build a casino.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.486" offset="278444">Patchak thinks a casino will change the character of the area and cause him economic, environmental, and aesthetic harm and he says the Government lacked the authority, the legal authority, to acquire this land under the Indian Reorganization Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.876" offset="339989">So, he asked the Court to reverse the Government's acquisition of the land by divesting it of title.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.655" offset="367156">When citizens like Patchak contest the legality of agency action and seek non-monetary relief, they bring a suit under a statute called the Administrative Procedure Act or APA.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.243" offset="417416">That Act contains a provision waiving the Government's sovereign immunity which is the legal doctrine that historically prevents governments from being sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.498" offset="458480">But the APA's waiver of immunity has an exception, when another statute forbids the suit, the APA's waiver of immunity does not control.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.665" offset="499127">The tribe and the Government contends that in this circumstance another statute called Quiet Title Act does forbid the suit because they say, that's statute retains the Government's immunity from any suits challenging the Government's title to Indian trust lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.472" offset="574360">That's the first question we address in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.048" offset="588675">We reject the Government's argument because we think the Quiet Title Act addresses a different kind of suit than the one Patchak brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.833" offset="623783">The Quiet Title Act is about, this is going to surprise you, but the Quiet Title Act is about quiet title actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.545" offset="654712">And a quiet title action is a very particular kind of suit which requires the person suing himself to claim ownership of the land in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.545" offset="690657">If Patchak claims to own the land here, the Quiet Title Act would control and it would indeed bar the suit because it prevents quiet title actions involving Indian Lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.640" offset="735065">But because Patchak does not claim ownership of the land, he is not bringing a quiet title action and the Quiet Title Act simply has no application.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.997" offset="772472">Instead, the APA's general waiver of sovereign immunity controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.700" offset="795251">But tribe and Government also have another objection to Patchak's suit that he does not have what we've called prudential standing to bring it.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.408" offset="830151">Recall that Patchak says the Government lacked authority to acquire this property under the Indian Reorganization Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.980" offset="860453">The prudential standing argument is that Patchak does not fall within what we've called the zone-of-interests regulated by that statute and so cannot bring this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.897" offset="904129">That argument depends on the idea that the Indian Reorganization Act is not about land use, but only about land acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.869" offset="939969">If that were true, Patchak couldn't bring his suit because it's only an objection to the way the Band is going -- the tribe is going to use the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.715" offset="975391">So, the suit would not be sufficiently connected to the statute that Patchak says was violated, but here, that's just not true and so we reject the prudential standing argument, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.972" offset="1024397">The Indian Reorganization Act serves to promote Indian economic development.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.967" offset="1044355">So, when the Department decides whether to acquire land for a band or a tribe it thinks a good deal about what the tribe would do with that land, including what potential conflicts the use will create and indeed it did so in this very case.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.325" offset="1109765">The upshot is that because the Indian Reorganization Act is about land use, a neighbor who objects to that use has prudential standing to bring an action under the APA.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.291" offset="1157622">We accordingly hold that Patchak suit may proceed and because that was the conclusion reached by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, we affirm its judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.382" offset="1198059">Justice Sotomayor has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
