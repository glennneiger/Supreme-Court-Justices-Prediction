            <text syncTime="13.224" offset="159368">This Court has consistently rejected the argument that Federal statutes that both create a right to sue and also bar waiver of rights under the statute are sufficiently explicit to override the strong Federal policy in favor of arbitrability expressed in the Federal Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.887" offset="237944">In two of those cases, Gilmer and Piette, the Court construed a statute the relative language of which is virtually indistinguishable from that and the credit repair organization fact that we have before us today.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.045" offset="294578">Those cases involve the ADEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.914" offset="306072">Both the ADEA and CROA, as I will call it, create a cause of action for aggrieved parties to bring actions for damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="77.633" offset="416935">So the -- first of all the disclosure statute is a -- describes in layman's terms, gives a quick description of an operative civil liability section which is set out in 1679(g) and which tells us exactly what Congress had in mind in creating a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.532" offset="508573">And when you look at the language of the actual operative provisions in (g), it's almost as if Congress deliberately went out of its way to use language that would not preclude arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.106" offset="558832">That language provides that a person who violates the statute shall be liable to the persons to whom--</text>

            <text syncTime="124.814" offset="605748">Suppose the disclosure provision didn't exist at all but that instead of the liability provision you had a provision that simply said: any person injured by a violation of this act will have a right of action or will have a right to sue under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.109" offset="682862">And then you had the waiver provision that you have in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.227" offset="695400">Is that enough?</text>

            <text syncTime="151.798" offset="713686">Because a cause of action and a right to sue are the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.916" offset="730091">They mean the same thing and this Court has consistently since Mitsubishi held that just because Congress creates a cause of action which is a right to sue does not preclude arbitration.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="167.558" offset="776694">Mr. McConnell, you started with the notion that the disclosure provision, the statute is meant to apply to ordinary people and if an ordinary person not schooled in the law read</text>
            <text syncTime="182.401" offset="836044">"you have a right to sue. "</text>
            <text syncTime="184.020" offset="842522">wouldn't they understand that to mean: I have a right to sue in court?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael W. McConnell</label>
            <text syncTime="190.606" offset="868854">Well, Justice Ginsburg, in the ADEA context, the government itself, the EEOC sends discriminated against workers a right-to-sue letter that tells them they have a right to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.683" offset="925174">But this Court has twice said that does not preclude arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.718" offset="941265">And that's because a right to sue is simply a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.337" offset="955789">It doesn't actually -- that doesn't mean that exclusively a right to be in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.824" offset="977732">It gives you rights which may be vindicated, and there are various ways in which they can be vindicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.478" offset="1000406">And the Federal Arbitration Act provides that the -- that this Court or that the courts must enforce private contractual agreements that provide for the vindication, even of statutory rights through arbitration.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="239.272" offset="1063518">Can you imagine any statutory language that would eliminate the right, the ability of the parties to enter into an arbitration agreement other than language that expressly prohibits the waiver of the right to sue in court in favor of arbitration?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael W. McConnell</label>
            <text syncTime="256.818" offset="1133735">Yes, Justice Alito, I can imagine it.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.401" offset="1144080">Now Congress has to date has not used it.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.770" offset="1153484">Congress knows perfectly well how to bar arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.840" offset="1169784">They have done it in a number of statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.874" offset="1177934">In fact, in the very Congress that enacted CROA, there were three different statutes that were proposed that would have eliminated arbitration for particular statutory schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.814" offset="1221716">None of them were adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.599" offset="1228821">But Congress is perfectly aware of how to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.901" offset="1242091">I don't think they have to use the magic words "no arbitration", but they certainly have to do something considerably more direct than this.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.241" offset="1283365">Here they've created a statute that provides that there must be liability and creates a cause of action, and then they tell people in a separate disclosure provision -- by the way, added very late in the drafting process, right -- simply to tell people that they have what is colloquially known for laymen as a right to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.838" offset="1365807">Now, we lawyers call things causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.190" offset="1375211">We call on things like the right to bring a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.426" offset="1396109">That is lawyers' language.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.243" offset="1403423">But when ordinary people talk about that, they think that's a right to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.414" offset="1420142">But a cause of action and a right to sue are exactly the same thing.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="332.716" offset="1437278">Mr. McConnell, the cases that you cite in support of your position rest on a distinction between procedural rights and substantive rights, which you invoke here.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.340" offset="1479805">But where does that distinction itself come from?</text>
            <text syncTime="345.709" offset="1489314">Because, it seems very atextual in nature, that distinction, which does appear in the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.213" offset="1519303">But when Congress talks about rights, why should we think of rights as limited to substantive rights rather than also procedural rights?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_w_mcconnell" startTime="361.550" stopTime="492.620">
            <label>Mr. Michael W. McConnell</label>
            <text syncTime="361.550" offset="1552635">First of all, only our waiver argument depends upon those particular cases; we have a second argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.806" offset="1581683">But nonetheless, I think this comes from the very long tradition, at least back to the 1980s in Mitsubishi, of understanding that arbitration is a choice of a forum, but it must vindicate the substantive rights of the particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.934" offset="1650228">So this is the way courts have talked about the relationship between arbitration and the substantive statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.171" offset="1679172">So you look at the statute and you see what are the prohibitions, what are the substantive rights and so forth, and the arbitrators enforce all of those, but that the term rights does not include -- it does not mean that there is an exclusively judicial forum, just that whoever is the decisionmaker is going to enforce exactly the same set of substantive rights which are in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.786" offset="1777601">But Justice Kagan, even if that were not persuasive, Congress is perfectly aware that that's the way that this Court had been interpreting the words, because Gilmer, which interprets the very words 5 years, before enactment of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.521" offset="1876553">And we know Congress was aware of Gilmer, because the very same Congress that passed CROA also considered a bill considered a bill, considered and rejected, a bill that would have reversed the decision in Gilmer.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.530" offset="1936530">So Gilmer and the very question of -- of arbitration was before this Congress, and they knew that the word "any rights" was interpreted, interpreted by this Court, the way that it was in Gilmer, and they used precisely the language that was interpreted that way in Gilmer.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.158" offset="2007061">And so at this point there's a vocabulary.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.444" offset="2024197">It's like there is a glossary, Congress is using it, and even if it may not be, you know, fully textual, as you say, that's -- that's the way Congress now addresses the matter.</text>

          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="492.620" stopTime="508.646">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="492.620" offset="2076965">But the -- the act in Gilmer did not designate court action or right to sue as a right within the non-waivable provision.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_w_mcconnell" startTime="508.646" stopTime="604.757">
            <label>Mr. Michael W. McConnell</label>
            <text syncTime="508.646" offset="2141017">That's true, Justice Ginsburg and the question is does it matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.117" offset="2162960">I would say anyone looking at the ADEA's language, which says that an aggrieved person may bring a civil action in court, anyone would say that that is a right to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.841" offset="2209771">It is surely a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.158" offset="2215100">And indeed when this Court interpreted that statute in Piette, this Court called it a right -- a right to a judicial forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.982" offset="2254388">Three times in the opinion, the Court refers to that as a "right".</text>
            <text syncTime="542.100" offset="2274868">And the fact that our statute here refers to a right to sue, rather than a right to bring a civil action, seems -- certainly against the backdrop -- recall, please, that the question here is whether Congress has explicitly abrogated the -- specifically disavowed, specifically barred the use -- the arbitrability of the -- of the contract, and that all doubts are supposed to be resolved in favor of arbitrability, and the -- the statutes must be interpreted with a healthy regard for the policy in favor of arbitrability.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.331" offset="2459815">Considering this, and considering the paltry basis in the text for -- for that conclusion, I don't see how the Ninth Circuit's decision can be withstood -- could be upheld.</text>

            <text syncTime="629.908" offset="2626058">Often that's another layman's term for a cause of action, but this Court has held I don't know how many times, I believe it's at least six times since -- since Mitsubishi, that just because Congress creates a cause of action and says that it will be in court, that does not mean that -- that that does not preclude arbitration, that that creates a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.457" offset="2720308">And I think the -- the underlying logic of this is that the existence of a cause of action or of a right to sue, which I many suggest is a synonym for cause of action, is -- is not inconsistent with arbitration; it's the precondition for arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.717" offset="2785301">If there were not a cause of action, there would be nothing to arbitrate, right?</text>

            <text syncTime="1998.575" offset="8100697">But generally the Court has not considered the settlement of a case to be a waiver of the right to bring a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.681" offset="8129118">And that primarily came in the FELA cases that we cited in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.037" offset="8162555">But I think it was significant that in Wilko v. Swan, where the Court said we are going to interpret the securities act not to allow waivers of the right to sue, the Court said of course this wouldn't apply to something that came post dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.129" offset="8230996">And in McMahon v. Rodriguez de Quijas, what the Court disagreed with WILKO v. Swan about was whether the right to sue under that particular statute was nonwaivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.521" offset="8272478">But it favorably commented on the notion that of course, even if it were, it wouldn't bar a post dispute agreement to arbitrate a claim as a way of settling an actually pending dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2130.012" offset="8626489">But even to the extent that it comprehends arbitrators and maybe even one might have thought was principally applicable to them, you've got to realize that this statute, what it prohibits is only the waiver of the consumer's ability to arbitrate her CROA claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="2159.514" offset="8744458">And in fact, most -- well over 99 percent of the consumer arbitrations that were handled by the arbitration forum that was designated in this contract were collection actions brought by a company that says this consumer owes me some money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.560" offset="8812690">So that's kind of the norm.</text>

            <text syncTime="2181.261" offset="8831498">And if a credit repair organization were to initiate an arbitration against a consumer, that wouldn't violate the nonwaiver provision; but if the consumer then defended and said, wait a second, this contract is void because I never got the right to cancel, the provision would quite clearly prevent the arbitrator in that circumstance from saying, you waived the right to cancel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2997.192" offset="12095237">I mean, that tells you that -- first of all, it says, of course, "the Court shall consider" but I take it your position is when they say "the Court", they mean the Court or arbitrator?</text>

            <text syncTime="3005.698" offset="12129196">It means the decisionmaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.733" offset="12137347">Many statutes of course refer to things that courts might do, even though those statutes can be vindicated in arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.839" offset="12173814">Title VII for example has several provisions in which it says if the Court determines this, then it may do that, for example, issuing injunctions and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.712" offset="12213311">I -- when you import the substantive provisions of a statute into an arbitration proceeding, everything that would be substantively available from a court becomes available from the arbitrator, and that's the way I would read the punitive damages section here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.156" offset="12283110">I note, by the way -- if I might just respond to a few of the points made by my friend in response to questions -- begin with Justice Sotomayor's interesting question about the fact that the statute appears to make even offering a waiver, offering an arbitration clause, a violation; it's actually even worse than that for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.759" offset="12401497">One is that under their reading, a settlement is surely just as much a waiver as an arbitration is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.948" offset="12434202">Now, they say, well, oh, well, it only means post-dispute waivers, but that is not what this statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.535" offset="12464609">This statute is about all waivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.487" offset="12476416">In contrast to other statutes previously enacted, like the ADEA, which distinguish between pre-dispute and post-dispute waivers, this one does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.112" offset="12518943">So their position suggests that even a settlement offer is a violation of this statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3129.310" offset="12623642">Well, Justice Ginsburg, that was his answer, but what that tells us is that he is he is not giving us a plain language meaning of the statute, which is all that they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.951" offset="12662199">Their entire position is based upon a plain language reading of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.689" offset="12685187">Remember the way the Ninth Circuit begins its opinion by quoting Alice in Wonderland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.843" offset="12713817">It's -- it's all about plain language, but they do not offer us a plain language interpretation of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.513" offset="12740462">In order to avoid absurd consequences like making settlement offers a violation of the statute, they have to create exceptions, unspecified exceptions, to the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.041" offset="12802633">It would be much easier simply to follow the rules of construction that this Court had announced before this statute was enacted, and against which Congress operated.</text>

            <text syncTime="3190.301" offset="12867626">I think you can still say follow the plain language, but that doesn't mean you go so far as to say you can't enter into a settlement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3239.067" offset="13062708">The -- just a couple of other small points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.936" offset="13082143">My friend points out that this is the first statute in -- that at the time of this statute in 1996, that there had been no statute that explicitly barred arbitration, which is historically true but I think not particularly revealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.266" offset="13163541">It was only in '85 in Mitsubishi and then '91 in Gilmer that Congress became aware that it needed to do this in statutory causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.055" offset="13202620">And in -- by 1996, they were considering bills that explicitly avoided arbitration clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.078" offset="13238774">They weren't enacted, but this is for political reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.647" offset="13252984">Remember the political composition of Congress in 1996.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.016" offset="13270538">It is not surprising that statutes voiding arbitration agreements become more common when the political composition of the Congress changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.741" offset="13317454">This is fundamentally a political choice, and ought to be -- we ought to respect the choices that Congress has made.</text>
