            <text syncTime="11.756" offset="152492">Article III requires a private plaintiff to show injury in fact, which means at a minimum that the alleged illegal conduct made her worse off.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.712" offset="184257">Factual injury does not automatically follow from violation of a statutory duty owed to the plaintiff, and Ms. Edwards has not alleged the type of harm alleged by plaintiffs in the common law cases that she invokes -- no misappropriation of her property, no loss of desired opportunity or benefit, no injury to reputation.</text>

            <text syncTime="38.458" offset="259281">Let me just get -- use an example, a hypothetical based on the next case, really: I was thinking Congress passes a law, says you can't phone people between 7:00 at night and 7:00 in the morning and try to sell them something, okay?</text>
            <text syncTime="55.468" offset="327304">That's the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.420" offset="331065">And anyone who gets such a phone call gets $500 in damages automatically if they sue in court if they receive such a call.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.906" offset="357083">The harm was getting the call.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.556" offset="363666">So my grandmother, who is always complaining no one ever calls her, loved the telephone call.</text>

            <text syncTime="72.262" offset="394491">The best thing happened to her in a month, okay?</text>
            <text syncTime="76.231" offset="410373">Now, can she sue?</text>

            <text syncTime="78.650" offset="419986">If she does not have actual injury, the fact of the statutory violation would not give rise to standing in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.070" offset="441720">Now, it's -- I think it would be quite unlikely that a plaintiff would come before the Court and say: Actually the statutory violation delighted me; I nevertheless would like my $500.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.276" offset="482576">But if the injury-in-fact requirement means anything, it means that a plaintiff who comes before the Court must have a harm in fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="165.641" offset="767937">Because she can't prove it at the early stage, and the problem that Congress was concerned about was that you can't tell until the house is going to be sold in the end how adequate the title insurance was.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.668" offset="828123">So Congress is acting on the potential that these kind of kickbacks can cause harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.304" offset="850589">And this does seem to fit the bill of restitution, unjust enrichment cases, where the plaintiff doesn't have to prove any harm, she just gets back what the defendant should not have received.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.603" offset="951839">And in -- in the traditional sorts of cases -- unjust enrichment, of course, is an invention as a category that is relatively recent.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.443" offset="983186">But unjust enrichment cases reflect quasi-contract circumstances, where a benefit was conferred, that injustice should have been compensated, so the plaintiff is made worse off in not receiving the benefit or the compensation for the benefit; or a circumstance of constructive trust, where there was property or other right of the plaintiff that was misappropriated and used without the permission of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.408" offset="1083079">So an opportunity or a property was taken away.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.843" offset="1096767">This is not a case like that, and there is no allegation that there is anything lacking in the insurance that was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.616" offset="1123934">This is a circumstance in which Congress may believe that a certain practice as a general matter can tend to bring out -- bring about bad -- bad outcomes and can therefore make it unlawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="284.551" offset="1243575">But in those States in which there is no such mandate, you seem to be arguing that Congress can't ever presume damages or injury, that even in those cases the plaintiff has to come in and prove that they would have paid less.</text>

            <text syncTime="1226.647" offset="5011999">The question was, there are circumstances in which the legal relationship is such that there could be -- let me back up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.935" offset="5053168">The question is whether there is an injury in fact, that is to say a harm that exists as a factual matter, and those interests certainly can be reflected by the legal duties that are created.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.560" offset="5099666">So, for example, there are legal duties in contract that are intended to protect the interests of the contracting parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.249" offset="5126416">There are legal duties under the law of trust that are intended to protect the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.618" offset="5143865">But this Court has frequently reflected the fact that there is the question of the violation, but then there is separately the question of the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.807" offset="5180646">And the point that I'm making -- and it should be the same answer with respect to your question and Justice Scalia's -- is if the mere fact of a violation of a duty does not create injury per se, and none of the cases reflect that, and that is the proposition that plaintiff relies on here, precisely because of what she alleged and what she is attempting, the type of case that she is attempting to bring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.708" offset="5284300">She is attempting to bring a case in which the statutory violation is the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.545" offset="5303630">No other injury is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.078" offset="5309691">She very straightforwardly says, it does not matter if there is any economic harm, it does not matter if there is any quality difference, it does not matter if there is any consequential effect on me at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1403.345" offset="5718768">Congress has broadly prohibited practices involving kickbacks and the paradigm case has nothing to do with a situation in which a title insurance agent is issuing a title insurance policy for an underwriter.</text>
