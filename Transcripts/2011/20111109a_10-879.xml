            <text syncTime="101.068" offset="510767">As the Court has said in numerous cases, the ICC had rules in place with respect to different aspects of the train at different points in time, but the Locomotive Inspection Act was designed to address a very specific problem, which was boilers exploding on the line when the train was in operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.215" offset="595299">And that is the consistent way that the ICC, and subsequently the Federal Railroad Administration, has construed the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="152.951" offset="718284">So how do we -- why don't we apply the logic of Ray to this case?</text>

            <text syncTime="163.542" offset="760602">In the United States v. Locke case, the Court subsequently looked at Ray in terms of design in a statute that also specifically included the word "repair and maintenance", which is absent here.</text>

            <text syncTime="204.666" offset="925069">The first is, anything that the Court might think about design does not impair our failure-to warrant claims, which entail no challenge to the design of a locomotive at all, only to the instructions for its safe use.</text>

            <text syncTime="384.999" offset="1646467">Well, if I could finish my answer to your previous question, Mr. Chief Justice, there's a specific statute on that point, and it predated the Locomotive Inspection Act, and it provided that when there was a crippled locomotive, the -- the railroad did not face liability, civil penalties, to bring the crippled locomotive back to the yard, but it specifically said if a worker was injured during that process the railroad would face liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.471" offset="1748344">Our point here is that the Locomotive Inspection Act's field should be construed narrowly because in 1970 Congress expressly and comprehensively legislated in the Federal Rail Safety Act and provided a conflict preemption regime in which if a State had a rule in place that rule would be permitted to survive unless and until the Federal Rail Administration issued a regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="459.468" offset="1944367">And the argument is made in Napier that this particular State regulation is aimed at preventing sickness and disease, not at making locomotives safe, and therefore it's not preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.212" offset="2011240">And the answer to that was not: Sickness and disease are an object of the statute, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.615" offset="2036945">The answer was the Federal and the State statutes are directed to the same subject, the equipment of locomotives, and therefore it is preemptive.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jonathan Hacker</label>
            <text syncTime="1550.371" offset="6307965">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.808" offset="6325624">The LIA as construed by this Court in Napier, in particular in the passage quoted by Justice Breyer, delegates to the DOT the exclusive authority to determine the design and the materials of locomotive equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.629" offset="6372958">Petitioners, however, argue that States in fact may dictate locomotive design and materials so long as they do so for some purpose other than safety of use on the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.281" offset="6415590">But, as again in the passage Justice Breyer pointed out, Napier holds that LA -- LIA preemption is not about the purpose of locomotive equipment regulation and is not about the geographic location of the locomotive on or off the line when the regulation is enforced, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out in the earlier argument this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.884" offset="6486016">Regulatory power is broader than purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.163" offset="6499077">As Napier says, under the LIA, preemption is about the locomotive equipment itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.223" offset="6523319">What Napier referred to as the physical elements of the locomotive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1630.338" offset="6627809">I would have to defer to the DOT's view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.633" offset="6640974">It seems to me it would have been within DOT's power under the LIA to say a locomotive is not safe to operate if it can't be safely repaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.038" offset="6670545">Because there is no point in having a locomotive ready to go on the line if it -- as soon as it comes off the line there's a problem that's going to injure those who work with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.128" offset="6698966">But, we don't need to assert that position to defend the proposition we have now.</text>

            <text syncTime="2606.365" offset="10531861">But I think there would be a very good argument that it would be decided the same way today under the Ray case that Justice Sotomayor mentioned, was a very similar kind of delegation of regulatory authority; and the Court held that there was the same kind of field preemption.</text>

            <label>Mr. David C. Frederick</label>
            <text syncTime="2634.683" offset="10645128">Manufacturers clearly have the best information about the dangerous aspects of their products, and they issue warnings and instructions in manuals and provide all kinds of information so that persons working on their equipment are going to know the special hazards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.284" offset="10711583">It doesn't make sense to inoculate those manufacturers from liability where they have the best information to ensure that repair workers are not going to be exposed to risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.953" offset="10754215">With respect to the point about being on the line, the whole idea behind the Locomotive Inspection Act was not just for use, Justice Kennedy, but also</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.934" offset="10790160">"safe to operate on the railroad line. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.745" offset="10801445">Under the regulations, and this is well established, yard limits are drawn outside the bowl where switching operations and repair operations occur, so that everybody knows where the Federal LIA standard applies and where it doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.503" offset="10864452">And the reason why the LIA has had this kind of history with respect to repair work goes to the history of -- behind this Court's recognition of the Commerce Power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.265" offset="10907502">Up until the New Deal era it was well settled that Congress could not legislate on intrastate activities, which are peculiar to repair yards, and so this Court when it decided the Shanks case in the mid 1910s held that a railroad worker could not bring an FELA claim because his work was not in interstate commerce; it was only in intrastate commerce; and that is why the ICC throughout this entire period never devoted regulations to repair yards, because this Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence precluded Federal regulatory activity for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.485" offset="11060370">So if you look at this case from an historical perspective, Justice Kagan, it's not clear that the full parameters of the way the Court would explain Napier would be the same, because its approach to field preemption is so different after the New Deal era than it was before the New Deal era; and that is also why when this Court looks at regulatory implications of common law claims, it has had no problem allowing State law to have design defect claims with respect to planes, cars, motorboats and trucks, even though the implications of a State law claim might find liability for the insufficiency of the design imposing an unreasonable risk to the person who is exposed to that risk with respect to that interstate modality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.636" offset="11260991">There is no reason why you have to have a broad and expansive view of the field here because Congress subsequently has enacted in this very area to give the Federal agency preemptive authority when it deems that authority appropriate; and as the Federal Government says--</text>

            <text syncTime="2839.021" offset="11462552">But that's why, Justice Ginsburg, the point here is how broadly do you define the scope of the field, and Napier defined it in an historical context that we just don't live in any more; and there is no reason to give manufacturers a complete pass from liability when they have the best information to advise railroad -- railroads and railroad workers how to work on their equipment in a safe way without exposing their workers to unnecessary risks.</text>
