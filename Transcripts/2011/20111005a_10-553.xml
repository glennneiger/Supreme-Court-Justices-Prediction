            <text syncTime="12.224" offset="152221">Mr. Chief Justice and play it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.476" offset="173328">The churches do not set the criteria for selecting or removing the officers of government, and government does not set the criteria for selecting and removing officers of the church.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.000" offset="215333">That's a bedrock principle and these Respondents would repudiate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.969" offset="231215">They no longer seriously argue that Cheryl Perich was not a minister.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.189" offset="248142">Instead they argue that even people who are indisputably ministers can sue their churches on claims that turn on their qualifications, their job performance and the rules of ministry.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="46.995" offset="291401">Mr. Laycock, could you clarify one point?</text>
            <text syncTime="51.633" offset="309896">You say the church decides who's qualified to be a minister, but, as I understand the facts here, she was never decommissioned as a minister and, beyond that, she was even recommended by the officials to other parishes to be a commissioned minister.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.335" offset="432671">So it's -- it's odd to say there is any interferences with who is qualified to be a minister, because the church was holding her out as being qualified.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="douglas_laycock" startTime="94.795" stopTime="145.744">
            <label>Mr. Douglas Laycock</label>
            <text syncTime="94.795" offset="482513">Well, she was removed from her ministry at Hosanna-Tabor.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.280" offset="500485">They do not have to indulge in a vendetta against her and file charges with the synod.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.067" offset="519607">And if you look at that recommendation -- it's in the joint appendix -- it is not much of a recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.985" offset="539355">There is excellent, commendable, proficient, and in ministry qualities she gets proficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.458" offset="565164">We all know if there is a 5, a 4 and a 3, a 3 isn't very good.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.510" offset="581360">So they were not recommending her; they simply weren't pursuing formal charges against her before the -- before the Missouri Synod.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.764" offset="610408">And -- and -- and the problems they had were most severe at Hosanna-Tabor.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.103" offset="635800">In another congregation that didn't know this history, she might have been able to be effective again.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.155" offset="655966">That was for them to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.341" offset="660773">They make their own calls.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.207" offset="664221">But she was removed at Hosanna-Tabor, which is where the problem was.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="145.744" stopTime="239.870">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="145.744" offset="686373">Counsel, most of the circuits have recognized a ministerial exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.385" offset="732871">But they've in one form or another created a pretext exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.308" offset="764635">The reason for that is the situation that troubles me.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.295" offset="788564">How about a teacher who reports sexual abuse to the government and is fired because of that reporting?</text>
            <text syncTime="183.869" offset="838823">Now, we know from the news recently that there was a church whose religious beliefs centered around sexually exploiting women and I believe children.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.795" offset="898591">Regardless of whether it's a religious belief or not, doesn't society have a right at some point to say certain conduct is unacceptable, even if religious -- smoking peyote?</text>
            <text syncTime="213.472" offset="957210">And once we say that's unacceptable, can and why shouldn't we protect the people who are doing what the law requires, i.e. reporting it?</text>
            <text syncTime="227.896" offset="1014993">So how do we deal with that situation under your theory?</text>
            <text syncTime="234.485" offset="1041324">Under your theory, nothing survives if the individual is a minister, no claim, private claim.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="douglas_laycock" startTime="239.870" stopTime="268.973">
            <label>Mr. Douglas Laycock</label>
            <text syncTime="239.870" offset="1062849">I think if you look at the court of appeals cases, they have not indulged in pretext inquiries for ministers.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.043" offset="1091584">The case you present is obviously a difficult case, and I would say two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.847" offset="1110810">We think the appropriate rule should be the government can do many things to force reporting, to penalize people who don't report, but a discharge claim by a minister presents the question why she was discharged and the court should stay out of that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="268.973" stopTime="290.655">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="268.973" offset="1179251">The problem with that is that it doesn't take account of the societal interest in encouraging the reporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.329" offset="1212688">And in fact, if we -- if we define the ministerial exception in the way you want, we take away the incentive for reporting; we actually do the opposite of what society needs.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="douglas_laycock" startTime="290.655" stopTime="308.183">
            <label>Mr. Douglas Laycock</label>
            <text syncTime="290.655" offset="1265977">I understand that concern, and that was my second point, that if you want to carve out an exception for cases like child abuse where the government's interest is in protecting the child, not an interest in protecting the minister, when you get such a case, we think you could carve out that exception.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="308.183" offset="1336090">How?</text>
            <text syncTime="309.216" offset="1340270">Give me a theoretical framework for this?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="douglas_laycock" startTime="311.402" stopTime="356.781">
            <label>Mr. Douglas Laycock</label>
            <text syncTime="311.402" offset="1348942">The -- first you have to identify the government's interest in regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.906" offset="1379035">If the government's interest is in protecting ministers from discrimination, we are squarely within the heart of the ministerial exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.728" offset="1406307">If the government's interest is something quite different from that, like protecting the children, then you can assess whether that government interest is sufficiently compelling to justify interfering with the relationship between the church and its ministers.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.653" offset="1462000">But the government's interest is at its nadir when the claim is we want to protect these ministers as such, we want to tell the churches what criteria they should apply for -- for selecting and removing ministers.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="356.781" stopTime="397.858">
            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="356.781" offset="1530546">Mr. Laycock, the ministerial exception is not something new.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.068" offset="1547682">It has been widely recognized, as Justice Sotomayor mentioned, by the courts of appeals going back 40 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.422" offset="1581014">So we can see how the recognition of this exception within -- with certain contours, has worked out, and how has it worked out over those past 40 years?</text>
            <text syncTime="380.630" offset="1625840">Have there been a great many cases, a significant number of cases, involving the kinds of things that Justice Sotomayor is certainly rightly concerned about, instances in which ministers have been fired for reporting criminal violations and that sort of thing?</text>

            <text syncTime="397.858" offset="1694804">The only -- I'm not aware of any such case.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.793" offset="1706506">The -- the one case I am aware of cuts the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.078" offset="1719672">A minister, a priest accused of sexually abusing children who was fired, sued to get his job back, and the church invoked the ministerial exception and that case ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.884" offset="1758960">They were able to get rid of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.470" offset="1765230">There is a cert petition pending in which a teacher with a long series of problems in her school called the police about an allegation of sexual abuse that did not happen at the school, did not involve a student of the school, did not involve a parent at the school, someplace else; and -- and called the police and had them come interview a student without any communication with -- with her principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.370" offset="1868884">And the Respondents tried to spin that as a case of discharge for reporting sexual abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.757" offset="1890408">But if you look at the facts it's really quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.707" offset="1898245">And those are the only two cases I'm aware of that even approach touching on this problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="461.351" offset="1948818">So we can look at the various tests that are proposed here, and I think it's difficult to formulate the tests, but this can't even be -- be litigated because she is discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.210" offset="2012244">The allegation is that there is a retaliation for even asking for a hearing where these tests could -- could be applied.</text>
