            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="11.808" offset="152701">This really is a more technical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.614" offset="163882">Congress has provided that mandatory minimum sentences, typically five years or 10 years sentences applicable to certain offenders who possess certain amounts of drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.589" offset="215813">Until August 3rd, 2010, Congress' mandatory minimum sentencing laws treated crack cocaine as far worst than powdered cocaine, indeed a 100 times worst.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.332" offset="278716">That is to say, the same five-year mandatory minimum would apply to distributing five grams of crack as it did to distributing 500 grams of powder.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.943" offset="333155">As of August 3rd, 2010, however, a new more lenient mandatory minimum law took effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.809" offset="360636">That law treated crack as only 18 times worst, not 100 times worst than powder.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.329" offset="386759">The question here is whether the new law applies to those who committed a crack offense before the effective date of the statute, namely August 3, 2010, but they were not sentenced until after the effective date of the statute, August 3, 2010.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.657" offset="452065">So they committed it before, but they're sentenced after.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.683" offset="464185">Does the new more lenient statute apply or they have to go under the old one?</text>
            <text syncTime="94.770" offset="484456">The issue is difficult because a statute that Congress passed in 1871 says that we should assume the old law applies in the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.960" offset="533253">To those who committed a crime before a new law's effective date, unless the new law expressly provides that the new law applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.794" offset="568571">They have to do the old one unless it says expressly in the new one that this new more lenient one applies to them and the new mandatory minimum law does not expressly say it applies to this pre-enactment group of offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.833" offset="616741">We nonetheless conclude that the new more lenient mandatory minimum law does apply to that group.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.622" offset="643908">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="136.006" offset="649446">Well, for one thing as all of the Court agrees, the word expressly here does not mean that some magic form of words has to appear in the new statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.112" offset="689883">The question basically is one of congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.701" offset="704199">It has to be at least clear whether it is clearly implied or maybe it has to be of the plain import of the statute that Congress did intend to apply the new more lenient law to those who committed a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.524" offset="759474">They have not yet been sentenced as of the date the new law took effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.726" offset="776296">For another thing, another statute makes clear that to apply a new more lenient sentencing guideline to those who have yet to be sentenced as of the date of the enactment is the norm in the sentencing world.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.695" offset="824153">Language in the new crack law helps us along to this same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.655" offset="844006">Further, to hold the contrary. i.e., to hold that Congress intended the old harsher law to apply to those not yet sentenced would make sentencing law in this area less uniform treating similar offenders differently and it would bring about greater disproportionality treating different offenders similarly.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.925" offset="925090">Indeed, it would make matters worst in this respect, and they are important respects underlying sentencing than they were before the new law was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.271" offset="962497">Finally, we can find no convincing reason why Congress would have wanted these unfair consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.892" offset="989038">Why would it have wanted the new law not to apply?</text>
            <text syncTime="225.290" offset="1006592">Why it would have wanted those results?</text>
            <text syncTime="226.868" offset="1012861">We couldn't answer that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.246" offset="1018399">So, we consequently conclude that Congress clearly did intend the new mandatory minimum is to apply to those who committed a crack crime before August 3, 2010, were not sentenced until after August 3, 2010, the date the new law took effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.610" offset="1087885">We vacate the contrary judgments of the Court of Appeals from the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.428" offset="1103141">We remand for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.651" offset="1112022">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion in which he is joined by the Chief Justice, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito.</text>
