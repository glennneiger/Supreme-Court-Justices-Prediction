            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="9.766" offset="144447">The first case is Number 10-63, Maples v. Thomas.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.685" offset="176212">Petitioner Cory Maples was sentenced to death after an Alabama jury found him guilty of capital murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.532" offset="207559">On direct appeal, the Alabama Supreme Court upheld his conviction and sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.073" offset="233681">Maples then filed a habeas corpus petition in the Alabama trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.459" offset="255206">He alleged that the State failed to secure his constitutional right to an effective trial attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.037" offset="285612">The two attorneys appointed to represent him at trial, Maple stated, lacked experience and were minimally paid, and as a result he asserted his counsel made crucial errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.199" offset="346216">Maple state court petition was prepared and submitted by two New York attorneys serving pro bono both associated with the same New York based law firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.986" offset="393341">Because the two New York lawyers were not admitted to the bar in Alabama, they enlisted an Alabama attorney to move their admission and serve as local counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.564" offset="439630">The Alabama attorney agreed with the caveat that he would undertake no substantive work in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.477" offset="475366">Maples' attorneys filed his state court petition in August 2001.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.774" offset="504519">In the summer of 2002, while the petition was still pending, the two New York lawyers left their law firm and commence employment that precluded them from service as Maples' counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.384" offset="558958">Neither attorneys sought the Alabama trial court permission to withdraw and neither told Maples' they would no longer able to represent him.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.326" offset="594693">No other attorney at the law firm entered an appearance on Maples' behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.163" offset="618099">Several months later, the Alabama trial court denied Maples' habeas petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.609" offset="639833">The court clerk set notice of the denial to the two New York attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.897" offset="661044">Those notices were returned unopened by the law firms' mailroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.137" offset="681942">The clerk also sent a notice to a local counsel who assumed the New York lawyers would pursue an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.644" offset="712035">He therefore took no action in response to the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.927" offset="729172">With no attorney of record in fact acting on Maples' behalf, the time to appeal ran out.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.323" offset="758742">The Alabama courts subsequently refused Maples' request to file an out-of-time appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.103" offset="793851">Maples then filed a habeas corpus petition in federal court, again asserting he had been denied his right to an effective trial attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.253" offset="830422">The District Court and the Eleventh Circuit rejected the petition relying on Maples' procedural default in state court his failure to file a timely notice of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.574" offset="879741">The sole question before this Court is whether on the extraordinary facts of this case, there is cause to excuse Maples state court default.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.979" offset="925299">We hold that there is and therefore reversed the Eleventh Circuit's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.566" offset="943689">Attorney negligence or oversight, we have held, does not provide cause to excuse a procedural default and we do not hold otherwise today.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.081" offset="985694">But Maples alleges something graver than attorney oversight.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.376" offset="1002935">He contends that his attorneys abandon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.091" offset="1017772">"I was unknowingly left without an attorney of record," he complains or still, he pleads, "I have no right to receive and in fact did not receive notice myself because on the record, I had counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.074" offset="1081720">Absent any reason to believe I was unrepresented and therefore would have to act personally to preserve my right to appeal," Maple stated, no just system would hold him accountable for the default.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.613" offset="1135846">We agree, the attorneys Maples thought were vigilantly representing him had abandoned his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.020" offset="1169492">They did not so informed Maples or the Alabama court nor did any other lawyer at the New York firm timely seek the Alabama court's permission to serve as substitute counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.443" offset="1219229">To no fault of his own, Maples and inmate on death row was left unrepresented at a critical time for his state habeas petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.436" offset="1259144">And he lacked any clue that he better fend for himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.864" offset="1276907">The uncommon combinations of mishaps in Maples' case, we hold, provide just cause to excuse the procedural lapse in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.656" offset="1320061">Justice Alito has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.702" offset="1332182">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Thomas joins.</text>
