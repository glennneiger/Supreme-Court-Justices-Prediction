            <text syncTime="3392.963" offset="13678887">So there is no record here about personal jurisdiction because it hasn't been asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.683" offset="13697799">Now if the defendants have not in fact waived personal jurisdiction, then presumably the lower courts would apply the tests that this Court has established or in the 2011 decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.157" offset="13747745">And the same would be true of forum non conveniens or any of the other defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.526" offset="13765195">They have raised other defenses in this case that have not been fully litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.096" offset="13783481">So my basic position is that the Sosa framework actually is -- works.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.767" offset="13810126">It has actually weeded out cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.302" offset="13820261">These alternative doctrines have weeded out cases, but the court should not accept the categorical positions asserted by either of the Respondents, which are the broadest categorical positions even rejected by the government, or the government's modified categorical position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.330" offset="13892359">Those kinds of issues can be dealt with within well-established doctrines where lower courts have a body of jurisprudence that they can use to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.971" offset="13938962">The Alien Tort Statute as was applied to human rights cases from Filartiga on is part of a trend in the world today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.411" offset="13976683">The trend in the world today is towards universal justice for people that -- and corporations that violate these kinds of norms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.533" offset="14013254">That's the trend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.719" offset="14017956">In fact, the United States has been the leader in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.003" offset="14027047">Our government has proclaimed our leadership position to U.N. bodies and around the world.</text>
