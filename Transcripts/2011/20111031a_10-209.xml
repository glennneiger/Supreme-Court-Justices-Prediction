            <text syncTime="9.439" offset="143193">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.058" offset="153642">There are three points that I would like to press this morning regarding deficient plea advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.426" offset="171092">First, this Court has consistently limited the effective assistance right to ensuring the reliability of the proceedings where a defendant is adjudicated guilty and sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.983" offset="213305">Mere outcome is not the Strickland prejudice standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.685" offset="228143">Second, when asserting an ineffective assistance claim the defendant--</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="35.237" offset="246324">Could I -- can I stop you on the first?</text>
            <text syncTime="36.523" offset="251549">You say mere outcome is not enough, reliability of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.308" offset="266700">How does that fit with Kimmelman, where we said it, the right to effective assistance, does attach to suppression hearings, obviously where evidence would not make the proceedings more reliable?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="53.301" stopTime="89.974">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="53.301" offset="318631">--Justice Kagan, even in Kimmelman the Court remanded back to the lower courts to determine whether there was prejudice, and the obvious implication was that if there was no prejudice on the fairness of the adjudicatory proceeding itself, there would be no Sixth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.942" offset="373175">The second point that I wanted to press this morning was that when asserting an ineffective assistance claim, a defendant must show deprivation of a substantive or procedural right, and this Court has already held that a defendant has no right to a plea bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.487" offset="439317">Third, every possible remedy for deficient plea advice creates intractable problems demonstrating the--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="89.974" stopTime="108.352">
            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="89.974" offset="465335">Counsel, isn't there a right to make a critical decision on whether to accept or reject a plea bargain, once offered?</text>
            <text syncTime="100.830" offset="508698">There is no right to demand one or to keep it, but isn't there a right to make that kind of critical decision?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="108.352" stopTime="141.490">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="108.352" offset="538791">--Justice Sotomayor, the -- the not guilty plea is an assertion of the defendant's constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.939" offset="561152">It's invoking the right to trial that the Sixth Amendment contemplates.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.207" offset="574213">And so this situation is really more like Fretwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.409" offset="587065">It's not a decision that you have, for example, whether to have a jury or not to have a jury, or whether to have this attorney appointed for your counsel or not, because in each of those cases you have an underlying substantive or procedural constitutional right; and have you no right to a plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.836" offset="648714">And so this fork in the road is really an illusory one, because you have no right to choose the other side of the fork.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="141.490" stopTime="171.442">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="141.490" offset="671389">Suppose this were a death -- a death case, and roughly the -- the same facts, failure -- failure to communicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.262" offset="702422">And that leads me just to one other question that is based on your opening remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.499" offset="727395">We can think about adjudication as having a constitutional violation, injury, and remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.772" offset="760519">Are you saying that there was a violation in the abstract here but no injury, or was there a violation and an injury but just no remedy?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="171.442" stopTime="172.592">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="171.442" offset="791239">I'm saying--</text>

          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="172.592" stopTime="175.444">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="172.592" offset="795836">So if you could do all of that, including the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.994" offset="805345">I--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="175.444" stopTime="223.942">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="175.444" offset="807225">--Yes, I'm saying that there is no violation, because in order to prove a Sixth Amendment violation you have to demonstrate unreliability of the adjudicatory process.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.984" offset="841394">I am also saying that there is no reasonable remedy, and I will talk about that in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.702" offset="856231">With respect to the death penalty in particular, I would refer this Court right back to the Fretwell decision, because there, too, defendant and his counsel had an opportunity to raise a Collins objection that would have changed the sentence to avoid the death penalty in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.612" offset="915895">Collins obviously was before habeas process, and this Court held that the defendant could not use the vehicle of an ineffective assistance claim to regain that lost opportunity because he had no constitutional right in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.788" offset="972528">And so really the remedy -- I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.721" offset="980261">The severity of the sentence doesn't enter the analysis once you have established that there has been no violation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="223.942" stopTime="236.000">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="223.942" offset="1001159">When you say no violation, you don't mean that there was no ineffective assistance of counsel?</text>
            <text syncTime="231.631" offset="1031983">I thought that was conceded, that there was ineffective assistance.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="236.000" stopTime="250.842">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="236.000" offset="1049433">That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.283" offset="1054553">We have conceded for purposes of argument that there was ineffective assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.237" offset="1070331">But Strickland is a two-part test and, even after you get past the deficiency prong, there is still the question of whether this casts some doubt on the reliability of the proceedings.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="250.842" stopTime="270.237">
            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="250.842" offset="1108783">Well, I thought that the second part of the test asked about harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.544" offset="1123621">And here the person is sitting in prison for three times as long as he would have been sitting in prison had he had effective assistance of counsel at the plea bargaining stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.233" offset="1162386">So why doesn't that just meet the requirements of Strickland, both deficiency and prejudice?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="270.237" stopTime="274.791">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="270.237" offset="1186419">Well, that's actually the best argument that the Respondent has in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.106" offset="1201883">And the reason--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="274.791" stopTime="275.458">
            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="274.791" offset="1204600">Sounds like a good argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="275.458" stopTime="283.564">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="275.458" offset="1207212">--Well, the reason why it's wrong is because this Court has been very careful to define what that harm is.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.445" offset="1227170">Specifically, the word was "outcome" in Cronic and Strickland.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="283.564" stopTime="288.731">
            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="283.564" offset="1239709">And outcome -- there is a different outcome here.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.864" offset="1248904">He is sitting in prison three times as long.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.681" offset="1256114">That's a different outcome.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="288.731" stopTime="306.660">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="288.731" offset="1260293">Yes, but the Court went on to define outcome to mean reliability of the adjudicatory process.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.585" offset="1279728">Specifically, the language was whether absent the deficiency the defendant -- I'm sorry -- absent the deficiency, the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.608" offset="1319852">And what we have here is a situation where everyone acknowledges--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="elena_kagan" startTime="306.660" stopTime="322.105">
            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="306.660" offset="1332078">Well, take the sentencing cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.095" offset="1337825">The sentencing cases, the determination of guilt is over and the question is, is this person sitting in jail for one day longer because his counsel was ineffective?</text>
            <text syncTime="317.551" offset="1375650">And if he is we would find prejudice there.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.237" offset="1386412">So why isn't the same thing true here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="322.105" stopTime="346.986">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="322.105" offset="1393831">--Well, I don't believe it's quite that simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.355" offset="1402817">If there was some legal error, an error to which he had a constitutional right, then certainly what you said is exactly true.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.275" offset="1426536">But if you are talking about more or less days because of, for example, a judge thinking that the difference between crack and cocaine sentences was not appropriate or other things that are really up to the discretion of the trial court judge, Strickland says absolutely those things are not Sixth Amendment violations.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="346.986" offset="1493410">Well, I guess I don't understand that answer, because that answer seems to suggest that the assistance being provided was not ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.326" offset="1526742">But here, as Justice Ginsburg notes, you've conceded that the assistance is ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.563" offset="1547640">That assistance has led to a much, much, much longer sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.384" offset="1570941">As opposed to some of the sentencing cases suggest that 24 hours is enough, this is 10 years or something; and that should be the end of the game, no?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_j_bursch" startTime="376.073" stopTime="424.387">
            <label>Mr. John J. Bursch</label>
            <text syncTime="376.073" offset="1609707">Well, let's try another sentencing hypothetical, where it's clear that there was deficient performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.358" offset="1626843">Say that there is a local trial court judge and everyone knows that he has a certain predilection that if you like the local sports team he is going to give you a break.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.730" offset="1660385">If the attorney comes in and he does not press the argument that this convicted defendant likes the local sports team, he gets a higher sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.586" offset="1691732">That's still not a Sixth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.586" offset="1699777">Really, once you shift sentencing, the question is were you legally entitled to the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.807" offset="1720675">And simply because he failed to appeal to the right discretionary tendencies of the trial court doesn't really make a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.727" offset="1744290">Here we are talking, obviously, about the guilt phase and it's much easier here because it says clearly in Strickland and Cronic and Kimmelman and many, many other cases that that outcome difference, the harm difference, has to be reliability of the process itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.637" offset="1799983">It's a process--</text>

            <text syncTime="424.387" offset="1803013">You acknowledge, though, that it's ineffective assistance of counsel if you're -- well, no, I guess you haven't acknowledged.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.576" offset="1831748">Let me ask you: Have you provided ineffective assistance of counsel if you are a lousy bargainer?</text>
            <text syncTime="437.896" offset="1857034">You are just no good at the -- you know; I don't know -- the game of bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.050" offset="1881590">And so you do a bad job in bargaining down the sentence, I mean a notoriously bad job.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.621" offset="1907921">Is that ineffective assistance of counsel?</text>

            <text syncTime="452.406" offset="1915026">--Under the Court's first prong of Strickland, you would have to look at whatever the standards of professional practice were and, depending how lousy the bargainer was, it could or could not be deficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.346" offset="1950762">But the important thing is if it didn't have any effect on the subsequent trial and sentencing, then it would not be a Sixth Amendment violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="829.967" offset="3425322">And to us it makes no sense to order a second trial after you have already had a first error-free trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.305" offset="3450608">In addition, you think about these habeas cases; if you are issuing a habeas writ and vacating a sentence 8 or 9 years after the fact, like you are here, essentially you are releasing the, defendant, because witnesses will die, they will move away, memories will be sparse, and so that's the natural effect of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.516" offset="3515496">And in Cooper's brief, he doesn't even advocate for a second trial; he asks for specific performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.618" offset="3535872">The problem with that is there you are infringing on the prosecutor's discretion, which is sacred, to say what his plea offer is going to be.</text>

            <text syncTime="904.682" offset="3724163">The first is that you learn more information.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.332" offset="3734716">So here, for example, the prosecutor learned that not only did Mr. Cooper shoot Kali Mundy, but he did it while she was screaming and running away from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.054" offset="3765645">That's a changed circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.104" offset="3769825">He might not give the same plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.073" offset="3773691">Even more so in Frye, where they learned that he was picked for another criminal violation after the plea was given, and the prosecutor testified that he would have taken the plea back when he knew that.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.679" offset="3816114">But the bigger changed circumstance is the trial itself, because the prosecutor has now gone through the risk of having an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.451" offset="3847252">He has also put, for example, the 8-year-old sexual abuse defendant on the stand, something he tried to avoid with the plea offer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3403.147" offset="13717985">I would like to start at the one point where I think all of us, including counsel on both sides agree, and that's that a second trial after an error-free first trial doesn't make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.520" offset="13755496">And that right there says a lot about Mr. Cooper's case, because a Strickland remedy is typically a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.442" offset="13783186">And it's exceedingly strange that they are now saying that: I don't want a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.144" offset="13798024">That demonstrates that what they are claiming is not a Strickland violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.946" offset="13809204">I would like to address, Justice Breyer, your suggestion that maybe you could have specific performance of the plea; and if it's rejected, then the trial result could simply be re-imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.552" offset="13847656">And the question is: Well, what's the problem with that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.170" offset="13854135">And I can tick off at least five.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.004" offset="13861449">First, as Justice Ginsburg pointed, out it takes away the prosecutor's ability to withdraw the plea which he or she undeniably would have had the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.093" offset="13893841">Second, as Justice Alito said, it ignores that there is information that could be learned in the interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.080" offset="13913694">Mr. Cooper could have shot three or to four other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.365" offset="13922889">Third, it ignores the fact that an error-free trial has taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.650" offset="13940025">The prosecutor has taken the risk of putting that the 8-year-old sexual abuse victim on the stand, and you cannot take that risk away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.106" offset="13969805">Fourth, as I already mentioned, we have the separation of powers issue and prosecutorial discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.125" offset="13989972">Fifth, we are going to have intractable problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.827" offset="14000734">Say the offer was plead to A, we will dismiss B; he rejects it based on deficient advice; you go to trial; he is convicted on A and acquitted on B, and now we are going to try to enforce the plea on A?</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.087" offset="14057785">I mean, that's almost a double jeopardy problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.705" offset="14064264">So there is intractable problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.172" offset="14070115">The second point I want to make is about the death situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.924" offset="14085162">And that's one we take very seriously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.775" offset="14092476">And, Justice Alito, it may be that in a death penalty situation there could be a due process right or some other constitutional right that may mitigate in favor of requiring something be put on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.981" offset="14133332">But what is clear is that under this Court's existing precedent, that is not a Strickland violation because the amount of the sentence, whether it's death or 50 years, has nothing to do with the reliability of the adjudicatory proceeding and the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.224" offset="14186308">Finally, the last point that I want to make is something else on which we can all agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.010" offset="14201459">Mr. Cooper is guilty of shooting Kali Mundy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.812" offset="14216714">He also got exactly the sentence that the people prescribed for the crime that committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.299" offset="14238657">There is very little unfair about holding him to that sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.352" offset="14254853">As Justice Kennedy said,</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.952" offset="14261227">"It's the position of Mr. Cooper that it is unfair to have a fair trial. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.256" offset="14278468">And from our perspective, that is really the beginning and the end of this inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.791" offset="14292574">And unless you have any further questions--</text>

            <text syncTime="3548.658" offset="14300097">I have one -- It's more proper, I think, for the government of the United States under the Federal rules, Rule 11, there has to be a colloquy before a plea is entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.348" offset="14338863">Do you think the Federal rules and perhaps state rules should be amended so that judges, trial judges before imposing a sentence inquire: Have there been plea offers; have they all been communicated to the defendant?</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.506" offset="14387451">Is that good practice?</text>

            <text syncTime="3572.289" offset="14394556">--It could be good practice, but it wouldn't have solved the problem here, because even if they had put the fact of the plea on the record, the problem was the alleged deficient advice that the lawyer gave to the client in private.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.297" offset="14442621">And so that doesn't solve the core problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.868" offset="14456936">The core problem is that they are trying to claim that it was unfair to have a fair trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3601.342" offset="14510749">You know, the judge under your theory then would have had to inquire: Well, what advice did your attorney give you with respect to that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.662" offset="14532065">And then evaluate whether that advice was good advice or bad advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.531" offset="14543559">And I respectfully submit that that would not be a good policy to adopt by rule.</text>
