            <text syncTime="27.197" offset="217605">And the second is that Patchak, the plaintiff, lacks prudential standing because the interests that he seeks to vindicate in the suit are not within the zone of interests protected or regulated by section 5 of the Indian Reorganization Act, the provision whose alleged violation forms the basis for his complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="1694.601" offset="6887189">And as this Court has already discussed, the best evidence of that is the fact that Mr. Patchak filed this suit before the land was taken into trust.</text>

            <text syncTime="1738.927" offset="7064508">So why, if he could have sued early, before any title transfer, why isn't that all the relief someone in his position would be entitled to?</text>

            <text syncTime="1774.303" offset="7205987">And the reason that the Secretary adopted the 30-day notice provision is the very argument that we believe is misplaced here, namely that the Quiet Title Act springs up to bar judicial review after the land is taken into trust.</text>

            <text syncTime="3470.741" offset="13991763">And I think the -- the error in that analysis is -- is that the question here is not whether Patchak's suit is a Quiet Title Act action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.546" offset="14034918">The question is whether the Quiet Title Act expressly or impliedly precludes relief under section 702, and the answer to that question is yes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3493.775" offset="14083923">The first is that the general principle recognized by this Court in Brown v.

            <text syncTime="3509.319" offset="14146095">And here the Quiet Title Act is exactly such a scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.740" offset="14155708">It's the mechanism for adjudicating a disputed title to real property in which the United States claims an interest, and it has its own procedures, its own statute of limitation--</text>

            <text syncTime="3523.984" offset="14204713">If -- if you think that the quiet title action is really about the narrower set of cases, which is when a person himself claims title, how can you get from that to say that there is an express or an implied refusal of -- of this kind of claim?</text>

            <text syncTime="3546.426" offset="14294470">And the first is, just that -- that first sentence of 2409a(a), which is, you know, to adjudicate a disputed title to land on which the United States claims an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.126" offset="14329265">That's a perfect description of what this case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.266" offset="14341804">And the second is that the last sentence of section 702 directs our attention to whether the relief is expressly or impliedly forbidden by another statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.684" offset="14383495">And the relief that is sought here is an order compelling the Secretary to relinquish title on behalf of the United States to this land.</text>
