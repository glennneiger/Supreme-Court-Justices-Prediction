            <text syncTime="8.304" offset="140643">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.074" offset="155794">For 12 years, Mr. Clair's Federal habeas corpus petition was litigated in the Federal district court in front of the same Federal district court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.663" offset="190171">His petition raised 39 challenges to his guilt and penalty, and the judge oversaw years of discovery, presided over a 2-day evidentiary hearing, and received extensive briefing.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.219" offset="232385">When the case was under submission, Mr. Clair sent a letter to the judge expressing dissatisfaction with his team of attorneys from the Federal Public Defender's office, and requested that they be replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.593" offset="277838">The judge asked both sides' counsel for their position on Clair's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.645" offset="294034">The Federal Public Defender responded that, after conferring with their client, Mr. Clair was willing to continue with them for that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.318" offset="324754">The court then stated it would take no further action.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.103" offset="335830">3 months later, just before the court was to issue its decision in the case, Clair complained again.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.090" offset="359863">The court issued a written order--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="65.025" offset="367595">Was there some way that Clair knew that the court was just about to issue its decision?</text>

            <label>Mr. Ward A. Campbell</label>
            <text syncTime="69.410" offset="385149">--I think, Your Honor, the only way to be sure was the fact that at some point, as I understand it, the district court judge had announced the day he would be retiring, which would be June 30th of 2005.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.468" offset="429349">So, there's probably an inference there that it could be expected that the decision was going to be coming out by the end of the -- end of June 2005.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="88.056" offset="459651">There was a deadline set for all submissions, wasn't there?</text>

            <label>Mr. Ward A. Campbell</label>
            <text syncTime="91.274" offset="472607">There was an initial deadline set for the filing of the briefing, post-evidentiary hearing briefing, and there would be no extensions of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.966" offset="511373">Subsequently, there was in fact another submission by Mr. Clair in May of 2005 with some additional declarations.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.202" offset="540317">The court accepted those declarations, but made it clear it would accept no additional submissions in the case unless it ordered otherwise, that it would proceed with the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.225" offset="572395">Once upon -- anyway, in June, June 16th, 2005, Mr. Clair sent a second complaint about his counsel again, and the district court issued a written order denying that request, finding that Clair's counsel was doing a proper job and did not appear to have a conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.222" offset="652330">The district court had an excellent factual basis for that conclusion because it had just concluded work on its extensive order denying the petition in Mr. Clair's case.</text>

            <text syncTime="153.014" offset="719517">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.699" offset="726309">The -- what Mr. Clair's complaint indicated, there was some additional physical evidence that had not been examined or investigated before.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.286" offset="756611">He indicated that the Federal Public Defender actually had met with the Orange County law enforcement about the evidence, and he was upset that there was no further action being taken by the Federal Public Defender regarding testing, seeking DNA testing or testing of that evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="204.546" offset="925675">Mr. Clair also filed a notice of appeal because of the denial of his substitution motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.584" offset="941767">Those were merged together.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.350" offset="948872">Mr. Clair was appointed new counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.469" offset="957336">The new counsel then filed a rule -- a rule -- a request to the district court to entertain a Rule 60(b) motion, which the district court denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.842" offset="994847">The Ninth Circuit ordered that the district court consider the Rule 60(b) motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.878" offset="1010939">The district court heard the Rule 60(b) motion and then denied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.763" offset="1026508">$Mr. Clair then filed a protective petition, a petition for writ of habeas corpus for a successive petition, with the Ninth Circuit, and has also filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus with the California Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="357.044" offset="1535687">As I read the Ninth Circuit's decision, assuming an interest of justice standard because that's the one they invoked, they said what happened here is that the district court didn't hold a hearing to determine itself exactly what the dispute was about, and so it was a process failure, basically is what they're saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.127" offset="1635997">Now, you make assumptions based on matters that have come up since that hearing about what the dispute was about and -- but I still don't know what the Federal defender's position was as to whether or not communications had broken down with the client to a point where they thought, as they did on appeal, that they couldn't continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.276" offset="1740591">So, tell me why, assuming we accept that an interest of justice standard applies, the circuit court has no power or applied it improperly by saying -- forget about the remedy -- has no power to say, district court judges, you have to at a minimum inquire and set forth your reasons based on the facts of that inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="436.978" offset="1855425">And the reason is that, looking at the record and what was presented to the Federal district court at the time it received the request by Mr. Clair in June of 2005, what Mr. Clair's allegation was was that he disagreed with the investigative, tactical, strategic decisions that were being made by the Federal Public Defender.</text>

            <text syncTime="2601.809" offset="10514704">If mean, if there's a breakdown and the judge says that the only new evidence is that the moon was in the fifth house and that doesn't depend on anything, I'm denying -- or it was a new moon, I'm denying this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.384" offset="10564963">Justice Breyer, I -- I agree with you that the Ninth Circuit was struggling to figure out a way to most efficiently resolve the multiple appeals that were pending in front of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.227" offset="10624418">And they understood from the Rule 60(b) appeal that was also pending and from the appeal on the denial of substitution that there was this newly discovered evidence in the State's files; that the investigator who looked at it thought that it was really important; and they had no record about what it was or whether it should have been considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.192" offset="10720235">Now, they could have said, well, we're going to direct the Rule 60(b) judge to grant leave to examine the physical evidence and analyze it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.317" offset="10764748">And it was an abuse of discretion of the Rule 60(b) judge not to allow Mr. Clair at least to make some showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.423" offset="10797140">But the more straightforward way would have been to say: You didn't inquire of counsel; counsel may have had a very good reason for not pursuing this; but in the face of the specific allegation by a willing, percipient witness that there is highly material evidence in the State files and the public defender is refusing to do anything about it, all we think the Ninth Circuit was holding is--</text>

            <text syncTime="3007.419" offset="12137117">3599, what -- the mandatory appointment requirement was cleaved from what is now 3006 -- the discretionary appointment, where Congress said in the Controlled Substances Act, look, in death cases, at trial and in habeas, we're not -- we don't want to leave it to the court's or the magistrate's discretion whether or not to appoint.</text>

            <text syncTime="3042.425" offset="12277133">Congress -- Congress had no need in 3599 to reiterate the language in 30 -- 3006A(c), which itself is not limited to appointments under 3006A(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.021" offset="12339513">I am reading from page 95 of the petition appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.673" offset="12358113">The statute says -- I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.158" offset="12376085">It's page 93.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.927" offset="12383190">The interests of justice standard says this -- and I'm -- it's the last sentence on page 93A --</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.181" offset="12412238">"the United States magistrate judge or the Court may in the interests of justice substitute one appointed counsel for another at any stage of the proceedings. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.804" offset="12458736">It doesn't say</text>

            <text syncTime="3093.125" offset="12479948">If, like the rest of subsection (c), of which it is a part, is a general rule for duration and substitution of appointments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.898" offset="12519027">So even if it were not true that the sentence itself applied a force, it's, I think, only consistent with what Congress's manifest intention in enacting 35 -- what became 3599(e) to permit that when substitution is requested, that motion be adjudicated in light of the interests of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.281" offset="12620591">And indeed, that's what the State told Judge Taylor the standard was in this very case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.119" offset="12643892">I mean, look at it this way, Justice Scalia: imagine that a district court -- I realize that the cases will be few and far between.</text>

            <text syncTime="3391.049" offset="13671654">But let me give you one not at all far-fetched example: the State had -- the county coroner had determined that because of the extraordinary similarity between the murder of a woman in the neighborhood -- very close by the night before and this one, including the very peculiar puncture injuries, the coroner's report in the State's file said this is very likely the same perpetrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.651" offset="13790041">The State has identified the perpetrator of that other crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.372" offset="13808953">And we don't know whether even at this day the State has matched that perpetrator's fingerprints with the fingerprints that were discovered next to the victim in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.678" offset="13854198">And it wouldn't be far-fetched to say that in a case involving either Brady -- may I finish, it will just be this sentence -- Brady or ineffective assistance of counsel, if the fingerprint evidence did link up in that way, it certainly would go into the habeas judge's evaluation of the merits of those claims.</text>
