            <text syncTime="8.470" offset="140940">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.141" offset="155568">The principal issue before this Court is the narrow issue of whether a corporation can ever be held liable for violating fundamental human rights norms under the Alien Tort Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.615" offset="201544">Under Respondents' view, even if these corporations had jointly operated torture centers with the military dictatorship in Nigeria to detain, torture, and kill all opponents of Shell's operations in Ogoni, the victims would have no claim.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="40.041" offset="267163">But, counsel, for me, the case turns in large part on this: page 17 of the red brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.414" offset="300705">It says,</text>
            <text syncTime="50.349" offset="308437">"International law does not recognize corporate responsibility for the alleged offenses here. "</text>
            <text syncTime="55.468" offset="328917">And the -- one of the -- the amicus brief for Chevron says,</text>
            <text syncTime="59.455" offset="344904">"No other nation in the world permits its court to exercise universal civil jurisdiction over alleged extraterritorial human rights abuses to which the nation has no connection. "</text>
            <text syncTime="68.644" offset="381580">And in reading through the briefs, I was trying to find the best authority you have to refute that proposition, or are you going to say that that proposition is irrelevant?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul Hoffman</label>
            <text syncTime="80.885" offset="430585">Well, there -- there are a couple of questions within that.</text>

          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="85.004" stopTime="87.272">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="85.004" offset="447095">And it -- it involves your whole argument, of course.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul Hoffman</label>

            <text syncTime="87.839" offset="458380">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.289" offset="460156">[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="89.658" offset="465694">And -- and let me start by saying that the international human rights norms that are at the basis of this case for the plaintiffs -- crimes against humanity, torture, prolonged arbitrary detention, extrajudicial executions -- all of those human rights norms are defined by actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.923" offset="558690">They're not defined by whether the perpetrator is a human being or a corporation or another kind of entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.843" offset="590455">And so, I think that the -- the Respondents are wrong when they say that international law does not extend to -- to those kinds of acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.635" offset="629534">They do -- it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.251" offset="636012">And the United States agrees with that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.103" offset="647402">What they have tried to -- to conflate is the question about whether international law -- the international law norms apply to a corporation or a person with whether there's a -- an international consensus with respect to how those norms should be enforced, particularly within domestic civil jurisdiction as opposed to criminal jurisdiction.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="162.237" stopTime="174.414">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="162.237" offset="755967">But in -- in the area of international criminal law, which is just analogous, I recognize, there is a distinction made between individuals and corporations.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_hoffman" startTime="174.414" stopTime="246.860">
            <label>Mr. Paul Hoffman</label>
            <text syncTime="174.414" offset="804659">Well, there's a distinction made within the jurisdiction of certain modern international criminal tribunals.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.318" offset="836319">And Respondents take their position too far in this, because what they've said is that the fact that corporations can't be found liable criminally under the International Criminal Court, for example, means that the norms, the underlying norms -- genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes when it comes to the International Criminal Court -- don't apply to corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.885" offset="934540">And that's -- that clearly is wrong because the United Kingdom and Netherlands, for example, the two home countries of -- of these corporations has passed domestic implementing legislation that imposes criminal penalties for violations of those very norms.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.596" offset="1009459">So, there's no question that it can be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.481" offset="1020953">What the most important -- I think one of the most important principles in this case is that international law, from the time of the Founders to today, uses domestic tribunals, domestic courts and domestic legislation, as the primary engines to enforce international law.</text>

            <text syncTime="248.295" offset="1100261">--Mr. Hoffman, I -- I thought that Justice Kennedy asked you, is there another nation that has a counterpart to 1350 that imposes civil liability on corporations for violations of customary international law, whether the conduct occurred abroad, the harmed person is employed, and the defendant is not a U.S. resident?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul Hoffman</label>
            <text syncTime="280.433" offset="1228783">Well, the -- there are two parts to -- to my answer to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.318" offset="1248323">One is that the Alien Tort Statute is a -- is a unique way of enforcing the law of nations, in terms of the way that the Founders married tort law and violations of the law of nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.478" offset="1300985">In the international human rights amicus brief, the amicus brief of international human rights organizations, at pages 18 to 22, there's a whole series of cases where the domestic courts and domestic legislation of various states around the world have addressed those kinds of issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.724" offset="1385936">And so, there isn't an exact analogue to the Alien Tort Statute, but there's no question that domestic legislation and domestic courts have taken on these kinds of issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="338.870" offset="1462527">So, I think the question is whether there's any other country in the world where these plaintiffs could have brought these claims against the Respondents.</text>

            <text syncTime="396.891" offset="1694598">So, in terms of the underlying tort action, we have plaintiffs who are U.S. residents and were U.S. residents when they filed this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.330" offset="1728349">They found a tortfeasor within the United States that they believe was responsible for these torts, and from Mostyn v.

            <text syncTime="447.323" offset="1896368">I would say two things: One is that that doesn't really go to the question about whether corporations can be categorically excluded from Alien Tort Statute coverage, which is really the issue that -- that was decided by the court below and which was the question presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.654" offset="1977661">Extraterritoriality has to do with a different kind of issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.688" offset="1993753">I would argue that -- I mean, we've obviously argued that that's an issue that ought to be briefed on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.461" offset="2024891">But there is no international law principle that I am aware of, and I think it would need to be proved, that says that the United States Congress was disempowered at its founding from providing these kinds of tort remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.971" offset="2086958">And it was clear from the founding that the Founders at least believed that this statute would be extraterritorial.</text>

            <text syncTime="518.936" offset="2182775">But if -- if the Court looked to the Bradford incident -- the incident about which Attorney General Bradford expressed his opinion in 1795, which was an opinion that this Court found very important in terms of -- of interpreting the Alien Tort Statute, the Bradford opinion had to do with an assault on the British colony in Sierra Leone.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.385" offset="2280577">And so, it was not only extraterritorial in the sense of piracy, and I think everybody agrees that -- that this statute was intended to deal with piracy and maritime-related violations of the law of nations.</text>

            <text syncTime="625.356" offset="2608466">And so, one of the reasons that we've suggested that -- that -- that the extraterritoriality issue deserves full treatment if the Court is troubled by it, in a case where there is full briefing, because in this case it was raised by the -- by -- by the Respondents' amici largely, although the Respondents have raised it, and there -- the historians that have expressed opinions on corporate liability and others that would be interested in this question have not been able to put the other side before the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2888.443" offset="11660835">So we disagree with the premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.510" offset="11665119">But to answer Your Honor's question, the Federal common law still should not fly in the face of Congress, and I think the important question in your hypothetical is who is the "you"?</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.083" offset="11703363">As Justice Scalia just pointed out, Congress could amend the ATS tomorrow to provide for a Federal common -- a Federal statutory cause of action against corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.106" offset="11747457">But the one time Congress spoke to the very question at issue here, it held the diametric opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.860" offset="11770445">Congress in the TVPA rejected corporate liability by choosing the term "individuals" rather than "persons".</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.533" offset="11801165">And I realize, Mr. Chief Justice, that is the next case, but we think there is really the answer that the TVPA excludes corporations is compelled, and the U.S. agrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.972" offset="11834915">So Your Honor, the question is not what should Federal courts do in the abstract, it's what should Federal courts do when there is exact statutory decisionmaking by the political branches that has gone the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.029" offset="11887160">In maritime law in Miles v. Apex, you didn't -- you didn't decide to go contrary to Congress in the Jones Act; you said if there is a Jones Act statutory statement about wrongful death, we should follow it in Federal common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.289" offset="11944212">Similarly here, even if the international community thought there was anything to corporate liability -- which it doesn't, it disagrees; our two allies the U.K. and Netherlands disagree, and Germany has filed a brief saying it also disagrees with the ATS as it has been applied -- even if there was international consensus, you would still have to ask should the Federal courts, through free-form Federal common law making, do the opposite of what Congress is saying?</text>

            <label>Justice Sonia Sotomayor</label>
            <text syncTime="3402.495" offset="13716985">For all the reasons Justice Kagan mentioned, that the TVPA is not a limiting source, and can be viewed as a supplemental source.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.303" offset="13764215">But there does appear to be a little bit of incongruity, that aliens can sue corporations for acts against other aliens, but American citizens under the TVPA might not be able to sue corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.062" offset="13827327">How do we deal with that under--</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul Hoffman</label>
            <text syncTime="3431.847" offset="13834432">--There are a number of -- of differences between the TVPA and -- and the Alien Tort Statute apart from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.518" offset="13865152">I mean, for example, the Alien Tort Statute applies to a much broader range of international human rights violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.672" offset="13889707">Congress decided to legislate in those areas for the reasons that it decided to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.678" offset="13913740">The one thing that's clear, as -- as Justice Kagan said, is that the Torture Victim Protection Act was designed to -- to establish the -- or to make even stronger the Filartiga precedent, and shielded from analyses that challenged its bases, and was -- was not intended to restrict the Alien Tort Statute in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.424" offset="14004750">And obviously, the next case will discuss in greater detail whether the TVPA applies to corporations or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.280" offset="14032127">If -- I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.732" offset="14045919">If I could just make a couple of additional points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.101" offset="14055428">If -- if it was true that international law barred corporate liability, then our friends the United Kingdom and Netherlands have violated international law by passing legislation that imposes criminal liability on corporations for violating genocide crimes against humanity, and war crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.996" offset="14135049">And I think that brief makes it pretty clear that whatever they're saying, that -- if -- if the Alien Tort Statute is a domestic enforcement of international law, then their views don't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.136" offset="14183532">And -- and -- and this is a tort statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.857" offset="14198474">That's -- there was a meaning to torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.909" offset="14218641">Skinner's case, for example, was a tort not only under English common law, it was -- it was a tort in violation of the law of nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.415" offset="14244659">It was robbery on the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.832" offset="14250406">The law of nations was incorporated in English common law just as it was in the founding in our country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.652" offset="14273603">And under the Peck heyday, it is still a part of our land -- the law of our land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.140" offset="14295545">"Tort" meant to the founders "tort remedies".</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.841" offset="14310383">It meant -- it meant that the means of enforcement would be done by the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.161" offset="14331699">That's all that was available then, it's all that's available now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.463" offset="14344865">And -- and international law places no restriction on the way domestic jurisdictions enforce international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.351" offset="14372450">There is a general principle law of corporate civil liability for all of the things that we allege in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.005" offset="14395020">In every legal system in the world, one can get redressed for this kind of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.825" offset="14410380">Countries don't necessarily call it a violation of the law of nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.361" offset="14424486">They didn't fashion the statute the way our founders did for the reasons that they did--</text>
