            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">I have our opinion this morning in case 10-704, Messerschmidt versus Millender.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.494" offset="132409">Shelly Kelly decided to break off her romantic relationship with Jerry Ray Bowen and moved out her apartment to which Bowen had a key.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.677" offset="165115">Bowen had assaulted Kelly before, was an active gang member, and had an extensive history of involvement in violent and firearms crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.347" offset="199805">Fearing an attack from Bowen, Kelly asked officers from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to accompany here while she gathered her things.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.385" offset="231988">Deputies from the Sheriff's Department came to assist Kelly, but were called away to respond to an emergency before the move was complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.919" offset="262081">As soon as the officers left, an enraged Bowen appeared at the bottom of the stairs to the apartment, yelling "I told you never to call the cops on me."</text>
            <text syncTime="46.479" offset="292383">Bowen charged up the stairs, grabbed Kelly and tried to throw her over the railing of the second-story landing.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.278" offset="315580">When Kelly successfully resisted, Bowen bit her on the shoulder and attempted to drag her inside the apartment by her hair.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.677" offset="341180">She was able to break free and ran to her car.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.870" offset="353928">As Kelly got into here car, Bowen stepped out of the apartment armed with a pistol grip sawed-off shotgun.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.414" offset="376080">He ran in front car, pointed the shotgun at Kelly and said, "If you try to leave, I'll kill you."</text>
            <text syncTime="72.768" offset="397500">Kelly ducked behind the dashboards, slammed the gas pedal and sped away.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.473" offset="412338">Bowen fired five shots at the car blowing out the left front tire but Kelly made good her escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.777" offset="437520">She quickly located police officers and reported the attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.355" offset="451835">They returned to the apartment, but by then Bowen had fled.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.547" offset="472628">Detective Curt Messerschmidt was assigned to investigate the assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.611" offset="488929">He prepared an application for a warrant to search the resident of -- residence of Bowen's foster mother, Augusta Millender, where Kelly said Bowen might be hiding.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.329" offset="527799">The warrant sought authorization to search for all firearms and ammunition, as well as evidence of gang membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.475" offset="556325">The warrant application was accompanied by affidavits detailing the facts of the attack and Messerschmidt's extensive experience with gang related crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.723" offset="593314">Before submitting the warrants to a magistrate, Messerschmidt had them reviewed, first by Sergeant Robert Lawrence then by a police lieutenant and finally, by deputy district attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.980" offset="638349">After receiving their approvals, Messerschmidt submitted the warrant application to a magistrate who issued the warrant without modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.800" offset="673667">The ensuing search, however, revealed only a shotgun owned by the 73-year-old Millender, a California Social Services letter addressed to Bowen, and a box of .45-caliber ammunition.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.629" offset="724971">Millender sued Messerschmidt and Lawrence claiming that the officers had subjected them to an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.560" offset="756736">The Millender's claimed that the warrant was to too broad in authorizing a search for all firearms when the officers knew only about a sawed-off shotgun and the authorizing a search for evidence of gang membership when the crime was simply a domestic dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.926" offset="814101">The Court of Appeals agreed with the Millenders and concluded that the officers could be held personally liable for money damages because any reasonable officer would have known that the warrant was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.069" offset="862689">For reasons explained more fully in our opinion filed today, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.740" offset="881392">There's a doctrine in our cases called qualified immunity which protects government officials from lawsuits when they make reasonable, but mistaken judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.513" offset="920472">It gives government officials breathing room to act and our cases have said that it protects "all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law."</text>
            <text syncTime="216.720" offset="973343">In this case, Messerschmidt and Lawrence searched the Millenders' home under a warrant issued by a neutral magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.645" offset="1001033">The fact that a neutral magistrate has issued a warrant is the clearest indication that the officers acted reasonably and normally is enough to protect the officers from suit, normally but not always.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.286" offset="1047636">Our precedence have recognized an exception allowing suit when again "it is obvious that no reasonably competent officer would have concluded that a warrant should issue."</text>
            <text syncTime="247.246" offset="1095387">The "shield of immunity" otherwise conferred by the warrant will be lost, we have said, where the warrant was "based on an affidavit so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable."</text>
            <text syncTime="263.448" offset="1160276">This case does not fall within that narrow exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.863" offset="1173859">Now, we do not decide whether this warrant was overbroad in authorizing a search for all guns when there was information only about a specific one.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.618" offset="1208968">That specific one was a pistol grip sawed-off shotgun, owned by a known gang member, who had just fired the weapon five times in public in an attempt to murder another person because she had "called the cops" on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.598" offset="1264870">Even if the warrant were overbroad, it would not have been entirely unreasonable for an officer to conclude that someone who owned a pistol grip sawed-off shotgun might own other illegal guns or that seizure of the weapons was necessary to prevent further attacks on Kelly.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.132" offset="1334983">Now, with respect to the warrant's authorization to search for evidence of gang membership, we do not think it would be again "entirely unreasonable for an officer to view this episode as not simply a domestic dispute."</text>
            <text syncTime="320.548" offset="1388586">In the affidavit he submitted in support of the warrant, Messerschmidt described the crime as "a spousal assault and an assault with a deadly weapon."</text>
            <text syncTime="329.755" offset="1425471">And Bowen who is a known member of Mona Park Crips Gang had attacked Kelly after becoming enraged that she had called the cops on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.575" offset="1460788">A reasonable officer could view the attack as motivated not just by the souring of Bowen's romantic relationship with Kelly but also by a desire to prevent her from disclosing details of his gang activity to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.650" offset="1513033">And a reasonable officer could conclude that evidence of Bowen's gang membership could help establish a motive for the attack, support related charges such as witness intimidation that could be brought against Bowen, demonstrate that Bowen had familiarity with sawed-off shotguns or tie him to other evidence found at the residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.536" offset="1592550">Now, on top of all this the officers sought and obtained approval of the warrant application from the superior officer and a deputy district attorney before submitting it to the magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.328" offset="1639779">The statements in the warrant were true.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.392" offset="1652005">The officers thus “took every step that could reasonably be expected of them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="391.087" offset="1670813">To conclude that no reasonable officer could believe that the warrant was supported by probable cause would mean not only that Messerschmidt and Lawrence were plainly incompetent, but that their supervisor, the deputy district attorney, and the magistrate were as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.710" offset="1733298">So, even if the warrant in this case were invalid, it was not so obviously lacking in probable cause that the officers can be considered plainly incompetent for concluding otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.116" offset="1778960">The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denying qualified immunity to the officers is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.998" offset="1806440">Justice Breyer has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.963" offset="1818248">Justice Kagan has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.393" offset="1836011">Justice Sotomayor has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Ginsburg has joined.</text>
