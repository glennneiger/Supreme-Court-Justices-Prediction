            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="109568">As the Chief Justice has indicated, Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and I have written a joint dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.579" offset="139870">In our view, the Act before us is invalid in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.381" offset="158992">The joint dissent is organized this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.416" offset="167142">First, it considers the constitutionality of the Individual Mandate and that, of course, requires a discussion whether the mandate can be sustained as a valid exercise of Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce or as an exercise of its power to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.077" offset="229836">Second, the joint dissent considers the constitutionality of the expansion of Medicaid in light of the argument that it coerces States to surrender the power that must be vested in them under principles of federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.257" offset="282499">Third, the joint dissent considers the question whether the Act's other provisions can be preserved if the mandate in Medicare -- Medicaid Expansion are unconstitutional, first the Individual Mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.375" offset="330982">Now the statute requires a defined class of individuals to purchase health insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.939" offset="349268">This mandate is first defended by the Government as an exercise of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.866" offset="372987">It is true that if an individual does not purchase insurance, he or she affects the insurance market to a degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.237" offset="402453">But the Government's theory would make one's mere existence, the basis for federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.476" offset="423455">There would been no structural limit on the power of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.891" offset="437039">As a result, the Government's theory would change the relation between the citizen and the Federal Government in a fundamental way.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.939" offset="469222">We cannot accept the Government's theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.301" offset="478730">There are structural limits upon Congress' powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.841" offset="492837">In other words, there are some things the Federal Government cannot do and that clear principle carries the day here.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.049" offset="525751">It requires us to conclude that Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce does not give at the authority to enact the Individual Mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.098" offset="561904">This conclusion is supported by five Justices, the Chief Justice and the four members of this joint dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.634" offset="592102">Now, despite the fact that Congress exceeded its power to regulate interstate commerce when it passed the Individual Mandate, the majority of the Court holds that the Individual Mandate, if it's recast as a tax, is -- is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.902" offset="649153">The Court unanimously concludes that the Individual Mandate is not a tax under the Anti-Injunction Act but five members of the Court then pivot and hold that the Individual Mandate is a tax for constitutional purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.210" offset="698368">And to do this, the majority rewrites the statute Congress wrote, we disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.024" offset="721565">The Act requires a purchase of health insurance and punishes violation of that mandate with a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.270" offset="746642">But what Congress has called a penalty, the Court calls a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.064" offset="761793">What Congress called a requirement, the Court calls an option.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.864" offset="776944">And where Congress mandates that the person shall obtain insurance, the Court says he may but need not obtain insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.677" offset="808187">In short, the Court imposes a tax when Congress deliberately rejected a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.215" offset="834414">Judicial tax-writing is particularly troubling as a usurpation of the legislative rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.391" offset="867119">It places the power to tax in the branch of the Government least accountable to the citizenry, but the Constitution requires taxes to originate in the House of Representatives, the legislative body most accountable to the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.575" offset="923857">There, elected officials must weigh the need for the tax against the terrible price they might pay at their next election.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.494" offset="951442">Imposing a tax through judicial legislation inverts the constitutional scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.013" offset="973594">In the case of the Affordable Care Act, Congress went to great lengths to structure the mandate as a penalty not a tax, but the majority now says that it is a tax, at least for the purposes of sustaining it but will not for the purpose of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.935" offset="1037228">As to the Medicaid Expansion, the second part of this joint dissent considers the Medicaid Expansion.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.182" offset="1062201">The expansion provides new funds to the States for Medicaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.870" offset="1077039">Its whole design is to threaten withdrawal of all of the States' federal funding for Medicaid if the State does not comply with the expansion directive.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.783" offset="1120611">Now, in -- in so doing, the Medicaid Expansion leave States with no realistic choice but to expand Medicaid and to participate in the expanded program.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.038" offset="1165646">It coerces them into administering a federal program against their will.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.218" offset="1182365">That blurs the line of political accountability between the States and their citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.449" offset="1203263">The coercion effected by the statute is a violation of state sovereignty and on this threshold question of coercion, seven Justices agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.603" offset="1239939">Three Justices, however, devise a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.576" offset="1251850">That, again, in effect, rewrites the statute and changes its design.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.498" offset="1275465">And in a separate opinion by Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justice Sotomayor, these two other Justices conclude that the Medicaid Expansion is valid as written but in view of the disposition of the Chief Justice, they then agree with the remedy he adopts.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.719" offset="1332412">This joint dissent disagrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.822" offset="1340771">We find no judicial authority to rewrite the statute to permit this remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.911" offset="1361147">The design of the Court's remedy, contrary to the statute Congress enacted, is to bar the Federal Government from withdrawing all preexisting Medicaid funding if a State elects not to participate in the Medicaid Expansion.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.276" offset="1422587">Once the specifics of today's ruling are understood, it will be apparent that the Affordable Care Act now must operate as the Court has revised it, not as Congress has designed it and the consequences of that result are as follows - The Court offers States a choice, where Congress one of them, to have no choice and to make matters worst, the choice the Court offers may be illusory.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.501" offset="1523524">That is because even if a State elects not to accept the expansion, its citizens are still subject to the Individual Mandate, now recast as a tax, but now, in those States the cost of the insurance that must be purchased may well be for hire for insurance companies have no Medicaid Expansion to help defray the cost of insuring unhealthy individuals at unprofitable rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.515" offset="1619550">This distorted version of the Act is now decreed by the Court and no one else.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.351" offset="1638881">It is the position of the joint dissent that the Medicaid Expansion cannot be saved in this way and that the expansion must be declared invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.509" offset="1675557">The third and final part of our joint dissent considers severability, what to do with the remainder of the Act if the Individual Mandate and the Medicaid Expansion are unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.091" offset="1721846">In our view, both those provisions are essential to the Act's design and operation and all the Act's other provisions would not have been enacted without them.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.554" offset="1755700">It must follow that the entire statute is linked together and without the Mandate and Medicaid Expansion, the entire Act is inoperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.632" offset="1788092">Now, the joint dissent addresses at some length the question of severability for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.345" offset="1814946">First, it's necessary for us to address severability in order to support the conclusion that, in our view, the Act is invalid in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.253" offset="1846502">Second, our analysis of the Act's many interdependencies gives further support for our conclusion that the Court's Medicaid remedy is itself inconsistent with the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.592" offset="1899896">The analysis in the severability part of the joint dissent makes clear that what the Court has done is to force on the Nation a new Act so that the health care system is now governed by what the Court has said, not what the Congress has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.850" offset="1956948">The fundamental problem with the Court's approach to the case is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.451" offset="1967292">It says the statute Congress did not write.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.854" offset="1980980">The Court regards its strained statutory interpretation as judicial modesty.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.954" offset="1997281">It is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.349" offset="2002923">It amounts instead to a vast judicial overreaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.746" offset="2016507">It creates a debilitated, inoperable version of health care regulation that Congress did not act and the public does not expect.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.447" offset="2051302">The Court's disposition invented in a textual as it is does not even have the merit of avoiding constitutional difficulties, it creates them.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.422" offset="2083171">The judgment on the Medicaid Expansion issue ushers in new federalism concerns and place -- places an unaccustomed strain upon the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.909" offset="2125176">Those States that decline the Medicaid Expansion must subsidize by the federal tax dollars taken from their citizens, vast grants to the States that accept the Medicaid Expansion.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.501" offset="2167495">If that destabilizing political dynamic, so antagonistic to a harmonious union, is to be introduced at all, it should be by Congress, not by the Judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.499" offset="2215560">The values that should have determined our course today are caution, minimalism and the understanding that the Federal Government is one of limited powers, but the Court's ruling undermines these values at every turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.960" offset="2265401">In the name of restraint, it overreaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.503" offset="2275537">In the name of constitutional avoidance, it creates new constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.733" offset="2292464">In the name of cooperative federalism, it undermines state sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.737" offset="2312422">We must submit, with due respect, that today's decision somehow overlooks this Court's historic rule and responsibility to teach, to -- to confirm, to insist upon this proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.809" offset="2384729">The Constitution, though it dates from the founding of the Republic, does and always must have powerful meaning and vital relevance in the context of our own times.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.072" offset="2437810">This case presents real questions regarding the structure of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.572" offset="2455782">Some may think a case concerning constitutional structure with issues concerning checks and balances, separation of powers and federalism is somehow have lesser importance or priority in a case concerning liberties guaranteed in the Bill of Rights or the Civil War Amendments, but structure means liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.397" offset="2527148">For without structure, there are insufficient means to hold to account a central government that exceeds its powers in controlling the lives of its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.076" offset="2565810">Today's decisions should have vindicated, not ignored these precepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.555" offset="2587752">For these reasons, we would find the Act invalid in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.698" offset="2604262">With respect, we dissent.</text>
