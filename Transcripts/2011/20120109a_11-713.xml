            <text syncTime="23.781" offset="201582">The court repeatedly invoked the principle that these were only interim maps and not remedial maps, but that obscures the reality that a court has the authority to draw an election map, surely one of the most powerful judicial tools in the judicial arsenal, only if it is identifying specific statutory or constitutional violations or a substantial likelihood thereof.</text>

            <text syncTime="87.439" offset="456223">But that doesn't answer the question of whether a judge when having to impose a remedial map to address what all concede is a one-person, one-vote problem with the benchmark maps can look to the new maps which also remedy that same one-person, one-vote problem, for guidance.</text>

            <text syncTime="135.537" offset="648589">--No, I don't think so, Your Honor, for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.955" offset="658307">One is that the obligation to go to the preclearance court or to go to the Attorney General remains fully in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.727" offset="689340">So the only question is, what is going to inform the district court in Texas's exercise of remedial authority to remedy the one-person, one-vote problem with the remedial plans -- with the benchmark plans, rather.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.952" offset="742212">Now, this Court from the very beginning of its reapportionment cases has emphasized the need to look for legislative guidance in order to inform the judicial exercise of solving that reapportionment problem; and the need to look to the new maps I think is most acute, of course, with the congressional maps, because the benchmark is -- is a fine map, but it's a map for 32 seats.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.102" offset="838865">And Congress here -- the legislature of Texas has spoken as to how it would like to divide the new 36-seat allocation up, and it seems to be quite odd that the court would simply ignore that judgment when it could look to that as the starting point.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.231" offset="911381">It took it into account along with other plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.266" offset="927472">My -- Mr. Clement, suppose the D.C. court that has exclusive authority over preclearance in mid-February denies preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.907" offset="982120">And suppose -- suppose we accept your position.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.026" offset="994555">You prevail in -- in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.862" offset="1013885">And then the three-judge district court says this -- this plan -- these plans do not meet the section 5 requirement, we deny preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.003" offset="1066444">What happens if we use the Texas plan that has not been precleared as the interim plan?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="247.926" offset="1098104">Well, Justice Ginsburg, as a practical matter I suppose at that point Appellees would go to the court in Texas and say: You need to revise your interim maps once again.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.567" offset="1144707">Now, I think, since the premise for the court drawing its interim maps is that time is of the essence, it can't wait any longer, the Texas court may deny that motion or it may grant that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.791" offset="1197578">I mean I don't -- I don't really have a crystal ball to take that into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.826" offset="1209699">But what I do think is particularly anomalous is let's suppose that the D.C. court does deny preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.782" offset="1237598">At that point it's common ground that the plan, the legislatively enacted plan, even though it's denied preclearance, would be something that the Texas court would have to defer to.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.990" offset="1286395">That's basically Upham.</text>

            <text syncTime="303.011" offset="1318473">That was a plan -- there were two contiguous districts, there was a problem with them, the Attorney General said the rest of it was okay.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="320.520" offset="1388481">--Well, Justice Ginsburg, I mean it's true that the Justice Department does raise a purpose objection to the plans as a whole, but of course even that takes its force from the way particular districts are being drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.892" offset="1434039">It seems to me quite likely that, you know, obviously our position is that the D.C.--</text>
            <text syncTime="336.280" offset="1451593">court is most likely to grant preclearance; but if they were to deny it, it seems quite likely that they would deny it as to particular districts, and then Upham would make clear that you would give, that the Texas court would give deference to the legislative plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.040" offset="1506555">And the anomaly of the other side's position is you give less deference to a plan when preclearance is pending than you do when preclearance is denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="361.128" offset="1550963">Let's suppose that the district court in Washington moves expeditiously and issues a decision in mid-February.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.334" offset="1587743">Are there insuperable problems with postponing the Texas primary so that the plan that is to be used can -- doesn't have to be formulated until after the district court in Washington has ruled?</text>
            <text syncTime="387.646" offset="1657020">Texas has a very early primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.165" offset="1663080">Some States have them for congressional races in -- in the fall, and the latest presidential primary I think is at the end of June.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.084" offset="1694741">So why can't this all be pushed back, and wouldn't that eliminate a lot of the problems that we are grappling with in this case?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="404.857" offset="1725879">Well, Justice Alito, two -- two answers: One is, as a practical matter all of the affected, you know, entities in Texas have gotten together and they have agreed on the ability to move the primary back to April, given -- on the assumption that a map could be in place by February 1st.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.802" offset="1793693">Now, the primary has been moved from March to April already, so I can't tell you that it's impossible to move it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.325" offset="1827756">But it's also quite, you know, in a sense, I mean, the question becomes, I mean Texas has made its own determination that it wants to have a relatively early primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.697" offset="1865268">That's not something that popped up for this set of elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.549" offset="1876658">It's had that in place since at least 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.751" offset="1885435">And so the question is how much do you want to interfere with that judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="448.703" offset="1901213">Well, if we have a binary choice, if it's either the plan enacted by the Texas legislature or the plan that's already been drawn up by the court, yes, that could be presumably resolved rather quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.844" offset="1949800">But what if neither of those is fully acceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.248" offset="1967459">Then is it -- is it practicable to have the primary on the date that's been agreed on?</text>
            <text syncTime="470.883" offset="1989925">And if not, then would you just prefer to limit us to those two possibilities or would Texas entertain the possibility of moving the primary back?</text>

            <text syncTime="560.956" offset="2350310">And that's why in Upham, for example, that the court -- this Court knew that the objections were to two particular districts, even though the effect in Upham was to not preclear the whole plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.431" offset="2396181">And it seems to me the mistake of the district court is it effectively treats the unprecleared plan as a nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.002" offset="2422408">And that's the exact word that Judge Johnson used in the lower court opinion in Upham.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.739" offset="2441425">And this Court reversed and it said: No, you don't ignore that; but on the other hand, what you do is you take into account the judgment of the Attorney General in that case, but other than that, you take the plan into account notwithstanding the fact that it hasn't been precleared.</text>

            <text syncTime="708.385" offset="2939946">The Appellees proceed and I think your question proceeds on the assumption as if the violation is a section 5 violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.122" offset="2966904">But that's not what motivated the court's opinion, and you can -- I mean, look at page 96 of the Joint Appendix, where the court specifically says: Look, Texas has always been cleared.</text>

            <text syncTime="728.031" offset="3018522">The constitutional violation that is being remedied here and the only thing that gave the Texas court any authority is the one person, one vote violation with the old plans.</text>

            <text syncTime="754.682" offset="3125206">"The court began by considering the uncontested districts from the enacted plan that embraced neutral districting principles, although it wasn't required to give any deference. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2300.040" offset="9306614">The problem insofar as it exists is with respect to the particular submissions that Texas has made, because there were 20 submissions of statewide plans for administrative preclearance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3267.290" offset="13175557">In Bush v. Vera the Court said we have an interim election or a -- or an impending election and it's important for elections administrators in -- in order to be able to -- to implement without -- without interference a legitimate election process, to have whole precincts, because whole precincts makes a big difference in terms of how the election is -- is administrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.107" offset="13282868">The second reason is that this court didn't adopt this plan without any inquiry into the standards and proposals from the parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="3820.115" offset="15386875">Well, I -- I think that our position is that section 5 is clear that this Court should not start with the interim plan, but if the Court disagrees with me, I think that that's a much more reasonable approach than the one offered by the State, for the same reason argued by the United States: that is, that in the State's argument, you really turn section 5 on its head, because one of the principal benefits for the minority community in having section 5 is it alters of the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3854.602" offset="15524801">And if you maintain the burden of proof on the State before it can implement any portion of its newly adopted but unprecleared plan, that's far more preferable than shifting the burden, which would be inconsistent with section 5 in its intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3889.459" offset="15664295">Just a few points in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.659" offset="15669102">As one of Justice Alito's questions highlighted, one of the things that makes remedying a one person one vote problem particularly unique is there's literally an infinite number of ways to solve the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.017" offset="15714555">And for that reason, this Court has always looked wherever it could to legislative guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3907.003" offset="15734408">So much so that in White v. Weiser, this Court looked for legislative guidance to a plan that had been declared unconstitutional for failing to accommodate one person one vote problems, but yet this Court still said that the district court erred in not taking them into account to the extent that it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.780" offset="15801595">As to the hard choice, if it comes to that, of using either the legislative plan that reflects the legislative will, or the judicial plan that even the United States concedes is flawed, I think this Court has faced even more difficult choices in the past: Bullock v. Weiser and in Whitcomb.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.075" offset="15870767">And in both of those cases, this Court chose between an adjudicatedly unconstitutional State plan and a judicial remedy that it determined was flawed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3950.847" offset="15909846">And in both cases, it ordered the election to take place under the flawed constitutionally adjudicated imperfect plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3958.269" offset="15939521">Compared to that, simply saying that an election should go forward under a plan that hasn't been precleared is a far less serious step.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.959" offset="15970241">Now, there was a reference made to the 3 days of hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.577" offset="15984765">But the problem is, 3 days of hearings with an unadministrable standard is worse than 1 day of hearing with an unadministrable standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.981" offset="16014336">And what we ask is for a preliminary injunction standard that's familiar to everybody, everybody understands and everybody can apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="3994.526" offset="16084553">But here's why it shouldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.644" offset="16089046">That actually further intrudes on the D.C. court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.096" offset="16106809">Because the question that the remedial court should not be asking is, geez, do I really think -- you know, what are the odds that the D.C. court is going to preclear?</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.536" offset="16136589">It shouldn't ask that question at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4009.102" offset="16142858">It should ask the questions that are before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4011.321" offset="16151740">Is there a section 2 violation?</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.138" offset="16158950">Is there an equal protection violation?</text>
            <text syncTime="4015.473" offset="16168354">If there aren't those and I use the State's plan, does that create a section 5 violation?</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.010" offset="16190506">That is different from the preclearance question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.646" offset="16201059">And on that section 5 question, the burden is not logically on the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4027.830" offset="16217778">And that's the same section 5 question that the Court considered on its own motion, because it understands that even when it takes a plan, it has to be consistent with Section 5 principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4037.971" offset="16258320">Now, Justice Kennedy, you've asked the question, what if we take section 5 out of this, what happens?</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.959" offset="16278277">Then it's an easy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4044.059" offset="16282666">Then it's the preliminary injunction standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.827" offset="16289771">Now, the objection to that, of course, is, well, but how can you take section 5 out of it?</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.379" offset="16303982">But there's not interference with section 5, because Texas still understands it needs to get preclearance -- before its changes can take permanent effect, it absolutely positively needs preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4060.754" offset="16349435">It's never wavered from that prohibition.</text>
