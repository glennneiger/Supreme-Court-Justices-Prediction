            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="107520">Justice Kennedy has the announcement today in Case 11-210, United States versus Alvarez.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="6.362" offset="132911">This is an opinion announcing the judgment of the Court in United States versus Alvarez.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.885" offset="154958">Lying was his habit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.518" offset="165512">Xavier Alvarez is the respondent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.505" offset="173453">He lied when he said he played hockey for the Detroit Red Wings and that he once married a starlet from Mexico, but when he lied in announcing he held the Congressional Medal of Honor, respondent ventured on to new ground, for that lie violates a federal criminal statute, the Stolen Valor Act of 2005.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.874" offset="254955">Respondent was elected to the Three Valley Water District Board in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.579" offset="273763">At a board meeting, he introduced himself by claiming that he'd been a marine for 25 years, had been wounded in combat and who won the Congressional Medal -- Medal of Honor, and none of these statements were true.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.623" offset="317962">The Stolen Valor Act, a federal statute, provides that whoever falsely claims to have won the Congressional Medal of Honor can be fined or imprisoned for up to one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.448" offset="361221">Alvarez was convicted under the statute, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.314" offset="384731">It found the statute invalid under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.963" offset="403331">After we granted certiorari, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in an unrelated case found that the Act was constitutional so now, there's a conflict in the circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.550" offset="449620">It's right and proper that Congress, over a century ago, established an award so the Nation can hold in its highest respect and esteem those who, in performing the supreme and noble duty of contributing to the defense of the rights and honor of this Nation, have acted with extraordinary valor.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.956" offset="531331">Fundamental constitutional principles, however, require that laws enacted to recognize the brave must be consistent with the precepts of the Constitution for which they fought.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.030" offset="579605">As a general matter, this Court has permitted content-based restrictions only when they are confined to one of the few historic and traditional categories of expression, defamation, obscenity and fraud are among these few categories of punishable speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.261" offset="652539">Absent from those few categories, where the law does allow content-based restriction of the speech, is any general exception to the First Amendment for false statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.744" offset="694439">A federal criminal statute does prohibit lying to a government official, but statutes of that sort are inapplicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.833" offset="722756">This Court has not endorsed the categorical rule that false statements receive no First Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.663" offset="750132">By its plain terms, the Stolen Valor Act applies to speech made at anytime, in any place, to any person and it does so entirely without regard to whether the lie was made for the purpose of material gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.772" offset="806557">Permitting the Government to decree this speech to be a criminal offense, whether shouted from the rooftops or made in a barely audible whisper, would endorse government authority to compile a list of subjects about which false statements are punishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.910" offset="867056">That governmental power has no clear limiting principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.370" offset="888999">All this suffices to show that how the Act conflicts with free speech principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.177" offset="912196">But even when examined in its own narrow sphere of operation, it cannot survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.278" offset="928601">In assessing content-based restrictions on protected speech, we've applied the most exacting scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.771" offset="954514">The Government has a legitimate and even compelling interest in protecting the integrity of its system of military honors, especially with regards the Congressional Medal of Honor, and the opinion recites the history of -- of the Medal.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.388" offset="1013029">Although millions have served, the award has been given only 3476 times in our Nation's history.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.261" offset="1048555">The rare acts of courage the Medal celebrates led President Truman to say he would "I rather have that medal around my neck than be President of the United States‚Äù.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.214" offset="1080320">The stories of those who have won the Medal inspire and fascinate, and it's indicated just a few of those historical accounts, were recited in the opinion but that does not end the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.122" offset="1119922">The restriction on speech must be necessary to achieve the Government's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.086" offset="1135804">There must be a direct causal link between the restriction imposed and injury to be prevented.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.156" offset="1160046">The Government has failed to demonstrate this link.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.168" offset="1172167">Beyond general appeals to common sense, the Government provides no evidence suggesting that the public's general perception of military medals is diminished by false claims like those Alvarez made.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.160" offset="1224098">In fact, the contrary appears true.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.269" offset="1236532">Counter speech has long been the First Amendment's preferred method for responding to falsity.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.669" offset="1262132">In this case, the record demonstrates that even before the FBI began its investigation, respondent was perceived as an impostor.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.859" offset="1290867">Once his lie was exposed, he was ridiculed online and his resignation was called for publicly.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.934" offset="1315213">The outrage over respondent's lie of anything served to reenforce the public's respect for the Medal and its true recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.901" offset="1347082">The Nation well knows that one of the costs of the First Amendment is that it protects the speech we detest as well as the speech we embrace.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.691" offset="1382191">Though few might find respondent's statements anything but contemptible, his right to make those statements is protected by the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of speech and expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.274" offset="1424614">The Stolen Valor Act infringes upon speech protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.240" offset="1440392">The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.406" offset="1457110">Justice Breyer has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which Justice Kagan joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.066" offset="1475709">Justice Alito has filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Scalia and Thomas joined.</text>
