            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="8.667" offset="141082">This case comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.457" offset="168249">Petitioner operates two oil platforms on the Outer Continental Shelf off the coast of California, one by Valladolid, one of petitioner's employees spent most of his time working on one of these offshore platforms, but he was killed in an accident while working at petitioner's onshore facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.323" offset="251737">Valladolid's widow, the respondent here, sought workers' compensation benefits pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.038" offset="294578">The Lands Act extends the workers' compensation coverage provided by another statute, the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act to injuries occurring as a result of operations conducted on the Shelf for the purpose of extracting natural resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.866" offset="377960">An administrative law judge dismissed the respondent's claim reasoning that the Lands Act did not cover Valladolid's fatal injury because his accident occurred on land rather than on the Shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.871" offset="437938">The Labor Department's Benefit Review Board affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.046" offset="454656">The Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding that the Lands Act did not incorporate a strict geographic restriction, but rather required a substantial nexus between a worker's injury and his employer's extractive operations on the Shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.641" offset="533023">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.125" offset="550996">We reject the petitioner's argument that the Lands Act extends Longshore Act coverage only to employees whose injuries occur on the Shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.131" offset="598956">Nothing in the text of the Lands Act supports such a restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.672" offset="621108">The statute has only two requirements, the employer's extractive operations must be conducted on the Shelf and the employee's injury must occur as a result of those operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.005" offset="686414">Had Congress intended to limit the scope of Lands Act coverage solely to injuries that occur on the Shelf then Congress could have easily done so as demonstrated by the explicit geographic restrictions that appear in other subsections of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.930" offset="770215">We are also unpersuaded by petitioner's alternative argument which requires a nonintuitive reading of the Lands Act in light of other unrelated provisions in the Longshore Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.948" offset="830192">We find it unlikely that Congress intended to restrict the scope of -- of the Lands Act Workers' Compensation scheme through the convoluted combination of two separate legislative Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.780" offset="885572">Instead, we conclude that the substantial nexus test faithfully interprets the text of the Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.666" offset="913157">We understand that test to require an injured employee to establish a significant causal link between his injury and his employer's extractive operations on the Shelf in order to be eligible for workers' compensation benefits under the Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.584" offset="988808">Whether an injured employee qualifies for Lands Act coverage will depend on the specific circumstances of his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.785" offset="1025588">It was thus proper for the Ninth Circuit to remand this case for the Benefits Review Board to apply the substantial nexus test to the circumstances presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.069" offset="1074698">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment in which Justice Alito joins.</text>
