            <text syncTime="9.506" offset="143402">The Torture Victims Protection Act or TVPA authorizes a cause of action against “an individual” for acts of torture and extrajudicial killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.649" offset="200035">The question in this case is whether the term individual as used here means natural persons or whether the term is used more broadly such that the Act authorizes liability against certain organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.424" offset="263147">In 1995, Azzam Rahim, a naturalized U.S. citizen, traveled to the West Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.144" offset="293972">There, according to the allegations in the complaint, he was arrested by Palestinian Authority intelligence officers imprisoned, tortured, and ultimately killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.204" offset="338275">Ten years later, his relatives, petitioners here, brought suit against the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Liberation Organization asserting claims of torture and extrajudicial killing under the TVPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.589" offset="403790">The District Court dismissed the suit on the ground that only natural persons could be sued under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.393" offset="430958">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed and we now affirm as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.227" offset="458334">Petitioners concede that foreign states may not be sued under the Act, namely, that the Act did not create an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.910" offset="513087">They argue however, that the Act does not similarly restrict liability against other entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.877" offset="540881">In petitioner's view, by permitting suit against an individual, the TVPA contemplates liability against natural persons and non-sovereign organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.688" offset="592185">We decline to read individual so unnaturally.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.630" offset="607963">As explained in more detail in our opinion, the ordinary meaning of the word “individual” and the statutory context in which it is used persuades us that the Act authorizes suits against natural persons alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.363" offset="666896">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.972" offset="685286">The opinion of the Court is unanimous as -- except as to Justice Scalia who joins the Court's opinion except as to part 3(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="154.311" offset="722693">Justice Breyer has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
