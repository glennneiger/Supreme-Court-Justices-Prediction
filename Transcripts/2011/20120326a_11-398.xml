            <label>Mr. Robert A. Long</label>
            <text syncTime="11.256" offset="155359">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.260" offset="171450">The Anti-Injunction Act imposes a pay first, litigate later rule that is central to Federal tax assessment and collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.215" offset="211261">The Act applies to essentially every tax penalty in the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.519" offset="236443">There is no reason to think that Congress made a special exception for the penalty imposed by section 5000A.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.875" offset="269879">On the contrary, there are three reasons to conclude that the Anti-Injunction Act applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.962" offset="298196">First, Congress directed that the section 5000A penalty shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.587" offset="336753">Second, Congress provided that penalties are included in taxes for assessment purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.073" offset="366637">And third, the section 5000A penalty bears the key indicia of a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.727" offset="393282">Congress directed that the section 5000A penalty shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.702" offset="429226">That derivative triggers the Anti-Injunction Act which provides that</text>
            <text syncTime="84.904" offset="450020">"no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax may be maintained in any court by any person. "</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="94.276" offset="487532">Well, that depends, as -- as the government points out on whether that directive is a directive to the Secretary of the Treasury as to how he goes about getting this penalty, or rather a directive to him and to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.153" offset="566944">All -- all of the other directives there seem to me to be addressed to the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.891" offset="589932">Why -- why should this one be directed to the courts?</text>
            <text syncTime="123.609" offset="604769">When you say in the same manner, he goes about doing it in the same manner, but the courts simply accept that -- that manner of proceeding but nonetheless adjudicate the cases.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_a_long" startTime="138.453" stopTime="157.349">
            <label>Mr. Robert A. Long</label>
            <text syncTime="138.453" offset="664224">Well, I think I have a three-part answer to that, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.107" offset="682823">First, the text does not say that the Secretary shall assess and collect taxes in the same manner; it just says that it shall be assessed in the same manner as a tax, without addressing any party particularly.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="157.349" stopTime="160.568">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="157.349" offset="739770">Well, he's assessing and collecting it in the same manner as a tax.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_a_long" startTime="160.568" stopTime="267.321">
            <label>Mr. Robert A. Long</label>
            <text syncTime="160.568" offset="752622">Well, the assessment -- the other two parts of the answer are, as a practical matter, I don't think there is any dispute in this case that if the Anti-Injunction Act does not apply, this penalty, the section 5000A penalty, will as a practical matter be assessed and collected in a very different manner from other taxes and other tax penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.267" offset="851470">There -- there are three main differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.885" offset="857948">First, when the Anti-Injunction Act applies, you have to pay the tax or the penalty first and then litigate later to get it back with interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.193" offset="903192">Second, you have to exhaust administrative remedies; even after you pay the tax you can't immediately go to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.782" offset="937465">You have to go to the Secretary and give the Secretary at least 6 months to see if the matter can be resolved administratively.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.436" offset="968080">And third, even in the very carefully defined situations in which Congress has permitted a challenge to a tax or a penalty before it's paid, the Secretary has to make the first move.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.445" offset="1028162">The taxpayer is never allowed to rush into court before the tax -- before the Secretary sends a notice of deficiency to start the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.586" offset="1068704">Now if -- if the Anti-Injunction Act does not apply here, none of those rules apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.657" offset="1093050">That's not just for this case; it will be for every challenge to a section 5000A penalty going forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.394" offset="1123979">The -- the taxpayer will be able to go to court at any time without exhausting administrative remedies; there will be none of the limitations that apply in terms of you have to wait for the Secretary to make the--</text>

          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="267.320" stopTime="273.491">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="267.320" offset="1179672">Why -- why will the administrative remedies rule not be applicable -- exhaustion rule not be applicable?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_a_long" startTime="273.491" stopTime="282.663">
            <label>Mr. Robert A. Long</label>
            <text syncTime="273.491" offset="1204332">--Well, because if the Anti-Injunction Act doesn't apply there is -- there is no prohibition on courts restraining the assessment or collection of this penalty, and you can simply--</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="282.663" offset="1241008">Well, but courts apply the exhaustion rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.282" offset="1251457">I mean, I know you've studied this.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.651" offset="1256995">I'm just not following it.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.751" offset="1261383">Why couldn't the court say well, you haven't exhausted your remedies, no injunction?</text>

            <text syncTime="291.203" offset="1275176">--Well, in -- you could do that, I think as a matter of -- of common law or judicially imposed doctrine, but in the code itself which is all -- I mean, the Anti-Injunction Act is an absolutely central statute to litigation--</text>

            <text syncTime="307.164" offset="1339019">And the code says, first it says you must pay the tax first and then litigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.884" offset="1361902">So that's the baseline.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.234" offset="1367336">And then in addition it says you must -- I mean, it's not common law; it's in the code -- you must apply for a refund, you must wait at least 6 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.324" offset="1407669">That's -- many of these provisions are extremely specific, with very specific time limits--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="330.328" offset="1431701">They would apply even if the rule is not jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.382" offset="1443927">The only difference would be that the court could enforce it or not enforce it in particular cases, which brings me to the Davis case, which I think is your biggest hurdle.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.654" offset="1484991">It's a case quite similar to this in which the constitutionality of the Social Security Act was at issue, and the government waived its right to insist upon the application of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.978" offset="1534310">Of course, if it's jurisdictional, you can't waive it.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.663" offset="1545073">So are you asking us to overrule the Davis case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_a_long" startTime="361.632" stopTime="406.977">
            <label>Mr. Robert A. Long</label>
            <text syncTime="361.632" offset="1556880">--Well, Helvering v. Davis was decided during a period when this Court interpreted the Anti-Injunction Act as simply codifying the pre-statutory equitable principles that usually but not always prohibited a court from enjoining the assessment or collection of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.363" offset="1639845">So that understanding, which is what was the basis for the Helvering v. Davis decision, was rejected by the Court in Williams Packing and a series of subsequent cases -- Bob Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.288" offset="1699509">And so I would say effectively, the Davis case has been overruled by subsequent decisions of this Court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="406.977" stopTime="488.029">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="406.977" offset="1738275">Mr. Long, why don't we simply follow the statutory language?</text>
            <text syncTime="412.381" offset="1759904">I know that you've argued that the Davis case has been overtaken by later cases, but the language of the Anti-Injunction Act is "no suit shall be maintained".</text>
            <text syncTime="425.855" offset="1813821">It's remarkably similar to the language in -- that was at issue in Reed Elsevier:</text>
            <text syncTime="432.794" offset="1841510">"No civil action for infringement shall be instituted. "</text>
            <text syncTime="437.079" offset="1858647">And that formulation, "no suit may be maintained", contrasts with the Tax Injunction Act, that says the district court shall not enjoin.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.471" offset="1900234">That Tax Injunction Act is the same pattern as 2283, which says</text>
            <text syncTime="455.308" offset="1931581">"courts of the United States may not stay a proceeding in State court. "</text>
            <text syncTime="460.278" offset="1951538">So both of those formulas, the TIA and the no injunction against proceedings in State court, are directed to "court".</text>
            <text syncTime="472.086" offset="1998768">The Anti-Injunction Act, like the statute at issue in Reed Elsevier, says "no suit shall be maintained", and it has been argued that that is suitor-directed in contrast to court-directed.</text>

            <text syncTime="488.964" offset="2066268">Well, I mean, this Court has said several times that the Tax Injunction Act was based on the Anti-Injunction Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.868" offset="2093853">You are quite right, the language is different; but we submit that the Anti-Injunction Act itself, by saying that no suit shall be maintained, is -- is addressed to courts as well as litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.311" offset="2155607">I mean, after all, a case cannot go from beginning to end without the active cooperation of the court.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="518.400" offset="2184028">But how is that different from no civil action for infringement shall be instituted -- "maintained and instituted"?</text>

            <text syncTime="527.173" offset="2219032">Well, it's -- I mean -- perhaps a party could initiate an action without the act of cooperation of the court, but to maintain it from beginning to end again requires the court's cooperation.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.015" offset="2282457">And -- and even if -- I mean, if the Court were inclined to say as an initial matter if this statute were coming before us for the first time today, given all of your recent decisions on jurisdiction, that you might be inclined to say this is not a jurisdictional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.542" offset="2344524">A lot of water has gone over the dam here.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.762" offset="2361452">The Court has said multiple times that this is a jurisdictional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.548" offset="2376603">Congress has not disturbed those decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="585.092" offset="2450790">--There -- there are certainly a number of cases where the Court dismissed saying it is jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.096" offset="2470748">As I read the cases, I don't think any of them would necessarily have come out differently, because I don't think we had a case where the argument was, well, you know, the government has waived this, so, you know, even -- if it's not jurisdictional--</text>

            <text syncTime="605.923" offset="2534069">Well, the clearest -- the clearest way of distinguishing between the jurisdictional provision and a mandatory claims processing rule is whether it can be waived and whether the Court feels that it has an obligation to raise the issue Sua Sponte.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.033" offset="2590493">Now, if there are a lot of cases that call it jurisdictional, but none of them would have come out differently if the Anti-Injunction Act were simply a mandatory claims processing rule, you have that on one side.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.423" offset="2636051">And on the other side, you have Davis, where the Court accepted a waiver by the Solicitor General; the Sunshine Anthracite coal case, where there also was a waiver; and, there's the Williams Packing case, which is somewhat hard to understand as viewing the Anti-Injunction Act as a jurisdictional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.987" offset="2722359">The Court said that there could be a suit if -- there is no way the government could win, and the Plaintiff would suffer irreparable harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.176" offset="2751094">Now, doesn't that sound like an equitable exception to the Anti-Injunction Act?</text>

            <text syncTime="1955.783" offset="7933475">And the reason I say that, if you look at the exemptions from the penalty, the very first one is you are exempt from the penalty because you can't afford to purchase insurance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2314.549" offset="9368537">So -- and I think the reason for that has been -- is clear now after Williams Packing and Bob Jones, in that in order to find that the Anti-Injunction Act doesn't apply to something that otherwise would be a tax that triggers it, you have to conclude essentially that there is no substantial argument that can be made in defense of it as a tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="4747.217" offset="19099254">We have individuals who are planning for compliance in order to avoid a penalty, which is what their affidavits say.</text>
            <text syncTime="4753.906" offset="19126004">And we have the States, who will be subject no doubt to all sorts of adverse ramifications if they refuse to enroll in Medicaid the people who are forced into Medicaid by virtue of the mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4767.230" offset="19179293">So we don't have the problem of no adverse consequences in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4771.784" offset="19197475">And then, we have the separate distinction between the question of who has Article III standing in order to maintain a suit and the question of who is subject to a legal obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4784.758" offset="19249406">And you've said in your cases that even if there may be no one who has standing to challenge a legal obligation like the incompatibility clause or something, that doesn't somehow convert the legal obligation into a legal nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4801.804" offset="19317638">Finally, with respect to the States, even if we are wrong about everything I've said so far, the States clearly fall within the exception recognized in South Carolina v. Regan.</text>

            <text syncTime="5220.705" offset="20993236">And we look over here and it's a penalty and liability provided by a different law, which says collect it through the subchapter, and it has nothing to do with the IRC.</text>

            <text syncTime="5275.391" offset="21211933">The -- the refund statute that does specifically refer to penalties, that has nothing to do with this argument that it's assessed and collected in the same manner as a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="5286.314" offset="21255610">That would simply go to the point that well, you can't just call it a tax, because they've referred to it as a penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5292.837" offset="21281732">And finally, on jurisdiction, you know, I think the key point is we have a long line of this Court's decisions that's really been ratified by Congress with all these exceptions in jurisdictional terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="5308.362" offset="21343799">As I read Bowles and John R.
