            <text syncTime="7.470" offset="137859">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="10.939" offset="151756">The question in this case is whether it is fairly discernible from the Civil Service Reform Act that Congress revoked the district court jurisdiction to declare acts of Congress unconstitutional in actions brought by Federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.733" offset="214972">The answer is no, for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.935" offset="227720">First, the Civil Service Reform Act doesn't say that it precludes section 1331 jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.356" offset="253424">Congress could have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.089" offset="260425">Congress didn't say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.375" offset="265545">And there's no inference of preclusion of the Petitioners' claims that's fairly discernible from the scheme itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.029" offset="296161">And that's because challenges to constitutionality of statutes are just not the type of claims that are reviewed through the CSRA scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.337" offset="333359">Because of this, the Merit Systems Protection Board dismisses challenge -- challenges to constitutionality of a statute routinely as outside of its authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="88.189" offset="460732">I believe that, because of normal rules against splitting of claims, the employee would have to make a decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="98.164" offset="500647">In other words, that then, you -- it's not inefficient necessarily, but your scheme would force the employee to choose between her constitutional claims and her statutory claims.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harvey A. Schwartz</label>
            <text syncTime="111.421" offset="553728">Because of the importance of making the constitutional claims available in -- in a -- for judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.731" offset="606913">That is -- that's just one -- one of the options that the employee would have to weigh.</text>

            <text syncTime="132.668" offset="638678">Why wouldn't it be possible in that, for an employee to choose?</text>
            <text syncTime="137.222" offset="656964">If the employee had both constitutional and nonconstitutional claims, perhaps that employee could take advantage of the review scheme that's outlined by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.929" offset="703775">But in the situation where there's purely a challenge to a statute, the employee would have the option of bringing the claim in one of the district courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="157.618" offset="738466">That -- that certainly is a possibility, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.987" offset="756020">And -- and it is a possibility that the employee could bring his constitutional claim in the district court and still pursue his statutory claim before the Merit Systems Protection Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.645" offset="798652">However, I'd like to point out that, while this is an interesting hypothetical, we don't have to look at hypotheticals in this situation because we have in the Third Circuit since 1986 and in the District of Columbia Circuit since 1995, those two circuits permit Federal employees to bring their constitutional claims in the circuit court.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.243" offset="896977">We are unable to find a single instance in which there has been one of these mixed claims of a -- a constitutional claim and a statutory claim brought in those circuits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1856.555" offset="7534273">First of all, there was a special statutory provision in that case that limited judicial review of -- in that case to the record that had already been developed, and that's not true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.779" offset="7583175">Second, the Court was very concerned in McNary that if the plaintiffs weren't allowed to bring their claims in district court they wouldn't be able to receive any meaningful judicial review at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.801" offset="7619223">Now, here the plaintiffs in this case can get meaningful judicial review from the Federal Circuit, which every one agrees has the authority to resolve a constitutional challenge to a statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1948.315" offset="7901241">The MSPB would have had jurisdiction over the case in the sense that the challenge to the adverse action is properly before the MSPB.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.086" offset="7940321">I think that's very clear under 5 U.S.C. 7513(d) and 5 U.S.C. 7701 (a) which grant the MSPB jurisdiction over adverse actions under the CSRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.978" offset="7983893">Now the MSPB would not be able to adjudicate the constitutionality, would not be able to issue an order striking down a Federal statute and to determine that that would be what would be necessary here in order to grant the plaintiff's relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.302" offset="8037287">What it would have done is, first of all, it could have accepted any evidence that the plaintiffs or the government wished to submit on the constitutional issue in order to build up the administrative record for review--</text>

            <text syncTime="2185.477" offset="8849904">First, it is still our position that the MSPB has no authority to declare a Federal statute unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.967" offset="8875922">Now the government was taking the position that in cases where an employee had been removed pursuant to a statutory bar, that the MSPB lacked jurisdiction to hear an appeal of a case like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.941" offset="8923779">And the reason the government argued was not because the MSPB lacked authority to decide the constitutionality of a statute, although we believe that, too, but because the government was arguing erroneously that an employee who is removed based on a statutory bar that should have prevented his hiring in the first place wasn't an employee within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 7511.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.890" offset="9015625">Now the government no longer takes that 5 U.S.C. 7511 position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.925" offset="9035687">We've been consistent on that in the Court of Appeals and in this Court, and, therefore, we believe that the MSPB did properly have jurisdiction over the action in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.364" offset="9069437">Now, when it goes up to the MSPB, the MS -- and after -- the MSPB would then deny relief on the merits because it would lack the authority to declare a Federal statute unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2266.348" offset="9173405">This Court has said in several cases that administrative agencies generally lack the authority to declare a statute unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.685" offset="9202766">It's clear from Thunder Basin that that isn't a Federal limitation on the authority of Federal agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.406" offset="9225650">That is to say, if Congress wanted to give an agency the authority to adjudicate the constitutionality of a statute, it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.226" offset="9256892">And the Court noted that the mine commission in Thunder Basin believed it did have the authority to adjudicate the constitutionality of statutes, although the Court didn't reach whether the mine commission was correct about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.534" offset="9298166">And in this case, the MSPB believes, consistent with this Court's repeated statements, that it lacks authority to adjudicate the constitutionality of statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3412.152" offset="13756641">However under 42 U.S.C. 405(g), which was at issue in Salfi and Illinois Council, the district court is performing essentially appellate style review of the agency's findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.744" offset="13819021">That is, the preferred course is that any additional fact-findings that would be necessary would be made on remand and not taken by the district court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3449.525" offset="13906166">Well, under 405(g), rather than 1331, the preferred form of fact-finding is in the agency, and remands to the agency for further fact-finding whether than development of the facts in the district court in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.751" offset="13959037">In any event, the Court has recognized that in Thunder Basin, for example, where review in the first instance was in the court of appeals, that the court of appeals had adequate authority to give meaningful judicial review to a constitutional claim that an agency, in that case the mine commission, by hypothesis could not decide.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harvey A. Schwartz</label>

            <text syncTime="3487.133" offset="14056526">We are not here for an exercise in which side can best rewrite the Civil Service Reform Act so that the Petitioners' claims can fit in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.306" offset="14097277">What we are here for is to determine whether the background rule that Federal courts have Federal question jurisdiction, under the common law and under Section 1331, to rule on claims challenging the constitutionality of an act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.617" offset="14166450">Now, the fall-back position is that that jurisdiction remains.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.873" offset="14195498">What this Court is -- is tasked to do is to see whether it's fairly discernible from the Civil Service Reform Act as it was written by Congress, not has it's twisted or amended or bent to fit these claims in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.800" offset="14259237">Whether the Civil Service Reform Act as written by Congress revokes that background Federal court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.036" offset="14292151">And I suggest that the gyrations that have been discussed about well, we could do this, we could go up, we could go down, we could do these odd procedures, show that it is not fairly discernible that Congress intended to somehow try to shoehorn these claims within the CSRA framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.533" offset="14366130">And for that reason, not because the government system is better, not because the system that I'm proposing works better or is faster, but because there is no fairly discernible evidence from the Civil Service Reform Act as written by Congress, that Congress intended to revoke this very fundamental jurisdiction of the district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.934" offset="14471769">This is a Marbury case, not a Bivens case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.219" offset="14488905">This is fundamental jurisdiction, the power of the Federal courts to say that Congress, not some Federal agency, but that Congress acted in violation of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.325" offset="14525372">And I suggest that it -- the Court should act carefully before deciding that Congress took that fundamental jurisdiction away from the district courts, and that is not fairly discernible that Congress did that through awarding of the Civil Service Reform Act.</text>
