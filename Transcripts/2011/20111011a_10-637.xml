            <text syncTime="9.272" offset="144509">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.641" offset="157989">Any decision announced from this Court before a State prisoner's conviction becomes final constitutes clearly established law for purposes of applying section 2254(d) of AEDPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.448" offset="205218">For decades, in fact, it has been a bedrock rule under Teague and Griffith that State prisoners are entitled to the benefit of decisions from this Court that come down before finality, and that rule has delivered fairness and clarity to an area that that this Court has acknowledged previously lacked it.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.625" offset="270002">There is no compelling reason to chart a new course now.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.362" offset="284944">There is no doubt that AEDPA changed Federal habeas law in many important ways, but it did not change habeas law with respect to retroactivity, for under this Court's Teague jurisprudence States already had comity, as opposed to other areas.</text>

            <text syncTime="65.775" offset="370521">Because then presumably when his petition came before the Court, our normal practice would have been to GVR it, because the decision would come out the other way under -- under Gray, right?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="102.132" offset="515971">Well, let me take those one at a time, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.048" offset="523703">First with -- with -- with the GVR request, if he had had counsel that would have advised him to seek cert, he may well have done it and this Court may have GVRed, but realize that this Court isn't bound to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.873" offset="570932">This Court has discretionary jurisdiction, and I don't think this Court wants to take on the responsibility of -- of deciding every single case that falls into a twilight zone situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.312" offset="612728">You are going to have cases, like this one very well would have in light of what the Pennsylvania -- the State filed in its own Supreme Court -- wrapped up in procedural arguments, harmless error allegations, perhaps alternative State grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.452" offset="661316">And this Court often has decided that habeas is a better place to work that out, not GVR.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.290" offset="684617">Now, it may well have GVRed, but it -- I don't think the Court wants to take on that responsibility.</text>

            <label>Justice Stephen G. Breyer</label>
            <text syncTime="148.610" offset="701858">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="149.294" offset="704679">I mean, normally a lawyer just looks to see what the docket is.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.914" offset="727144">And when there's a case that seems to affect his case, he asks for cert. And our practice normally, since I have been here, is where it implicates the case you hold it until the case is decided; then a writing judge or other people look through it and see if in fact it really does affect it and if it does, we GVR.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.995" offset="807497">I mean, as a practicing lawyer here, have you discovered instances where we failed to do that, do you think?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="180.815" stopTime="208.683">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="180.815" offset="830694">Well, I can think of -- let me take it one step at a time.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.565" offset="841770">I think there are cases that this Court doesn't GVR.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.783" offset="850651">Because they are so procedurally complicated, the Court leaves it.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.069" offset="863713">In fact, I can think of one case right now in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.937" offset="875207">After Melendez-Diaz there was a case called Geyer that came out of the California courts, that this Court did -- held for Melendez-Diaz but did not GVR, in part because I think the State was making harmless error allegations there.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.312" offset="920764">And now the States and California are trying to figure out what to do in light of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.383" offset="936960">So that's one example, but--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="208.683" offset="942184">Normally I think if it looks like a mess procedurally, or whatever, the normal assumption is you let the lower court figure it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.421" offset="981159">Send it back, and I -- I think the research is that in actually most cases in which we GVR, the court reinstates the judgment below for one reason or -- or another; but the idea that we parse through them carefully -- I think if it's arguable, send it back and let the lower court sort it out.</text>

            <text syncTime="409.461" offset="1745293">And the way you frame it, though, frames what sounds to me more like an exhaustion argument than it does about a statutory construction argument with respect to 2254(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="418.215" offset="1780297">And this Court has never held either that you have to seek cert in this court in order to exhaust State remedies, nor to take a -- to take a claim back to State collateral review that you have already taken up through the State direct review system.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.874" offset="1830975">So if we had an exhaustion case in the future, maybe somebody would make that argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="436.778" offset="1854589">What's before you today is the hypothetical that -- that Mr. Greene actually did seek cert and for some reason this didn't GVR, or he did seek review in the Pennsylvania courts and they refused to hear it.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.586" offset="1905789">And under the State's position, even then you would bar him from getting the reliance on Gray, because Gray came down after the Pennsylvania Supreme -- I'm sorry -- the Pennsylvania Superior Court decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="463.611" offset="1961900">I mean, they initially granted review post Gray, and then they found that the grant was improvident most likely because Greene had not raised the -- the Gray issue below.</text>

            <text syncTime="483.740" offset="2042462">You're absolutely right that the State, faced with really no alternative but to try to argue waiver, did argue waiver in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which did dismiss the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.029" offset="2083631">But of course the order doesn't say why it dismissed the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.314" offset="2092722">And we litigated that very issue in the lower courts, and the Third Circuit squarely held that Mr. Greene had in fact preserved his claim in the Pennsylvania courts and on top of that, the Pennsylvania Superior Court had reached it and resolved -- understood him to be raising a Gray type argument and resolved it by citing a Pennsylvania case that had previously held that just putting an X in place of -- in place of the defendant's name -- was good enough to satisfy Bruton.</text>

            <text syncTime="870.538" offset="3589642">Again, we don't disagree it's a backward-looking statute, but backward-looking to finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.090" offset="3611794">Now, what Horn held -- Horn rejected a form of the very same argument that the State is making today, which is 2254(d) changes retroactivity law to establish the cutoff at the time of the State court decision, not as of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.749" offset="3666442">This Court rejected that argument and said, no, Teague and 2254(d) are distinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.569" offset="3685773">And we think the best way to understand them as distinct is to understand that 2254(d) deals with a standard of review, and Teague still continues to control finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.359" offset="3724852">Now, in light of Horn -- I'm sorry -- retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.211" offset="3736346">Now in light of Horn on the books, if the State were right that what 2254(d) was actually trying to do was also do retroactivity work and prevent the State courts from, as it put in its brief, from being 2254(d) is actually concerned with setting a cutoff at the time of the last State court decision for retroactivity purposes, you don't need Teague any more.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.611" offset="3841881">So Horn would have had to come out the other way if the State is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.163" offset="3856091">Now, let me go back to one other structural feature of the statute that explains -- that shows that Congress had in mind that Teague would continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.550" offset="3881691">That's the one I referenced earlier with respect to retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.371" offset="3896947">Keep in mind the State's argument would bar not just somebody like Greene from relying on a new case like Gray, but it would also -- the implication would be -- it would bar him from relying on a new case like Roper v. Simmons, Graham v. Florida, or other cases that alter substantively -- say the Constitution can no longer cover or punish substantive conduct in a certain way.</text>

            <text syncTime="984.294" offset="4044696">Remember, the State's view of AEDPA is that if a decision comes down after the lay state court's decision on the merits, then the defendant cannot seek relief based on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.519" offset="4085551">And then page 38 of the red brief, in footnote 12, they try to deal with this problem, but not in a satisfactory way.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.821" offset="4106762">And it's not an abstract problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.939" offset="4115226">If I give this Court a few citations -- if you'll permit me to give you three citations of working through the lower courts right now that raise Roper, Graham and Adkins claims, that the lower court's the only way they have reached them is by saying that Teague still has -- has a role to play with respect to 2254(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.234" offset="4188369">And the three citations, if I can give them very quickly, are Arroyo 362 F. Supp. 2nd 869, Holiday 339 F. 3d 1169, and Simms 2007 Westlaw 1161696.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.577" offset="4249809">Again, that's another structural feature of the statute that the State simply can't get around with this -- with its view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.000" offset="4279484">Now, some of the lower courts haven't quite focused on this, and in fact, it's because for many, many years after AEDPA was passed, States didn't even make the argument that you have before you today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.955" offset="4319295">All the way through Smith v. Spisak, which came to this court just a couple of years ago, the State of Ohio for example was not even making this argument, which is quite odd -- if you step back for a moment and realize that the State's position today is that the plain text of AEDPA is so clear that there is no possible way you could read it in any other direction.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="1113.262" offset="4560562">Justice Ginsburg, let me answer that question by starting, if I may, before AEDPA, because before AEDPA under Caspari and Teague there is no doubt whatsoever that that is what a Federal habeas court would have done, is say the cutoff is finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.086" offset="4615837">Because, remember, finality doesn't exist in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.038" offset="4623569">It exists against the Griffith rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.557" offset="4629734">So what Federal courts had always asked is, did the defendant not get credit for a case that he's entitled to under Griffith?</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.211" offset="4656274">So the question is did AEDPA change that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.496" offset="4669440">And Justice Ginsburg, you asked about the purpose or spirit of AEDPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.412" offset="4681143">We think what the spirit of AEDPA is, is to give States deference and to give them comity where they otherwise didn't have it at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.535" offset="4713639">And so it changed the standard of review, it changed the statute of limitations, but it didn't need to change Teague.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.089" offset="4735791">It didn't need to change retroactivity because, as this court had explained in Teague itself, in Justice Kennedy's long opinion in Wright v. West concurring, the very purpose of Teague was to give States the comity that -- of not foisting new law upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.265" offset="4796500">So you do end up, of course, in this situation, which is I think we called it earlier the twilight zone or perfect storm situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.121" offset="4823980">But this is something that this Court saw coming under Teague and long ago, even though even under those cases this Court said the purpose of retroactivity law is not to hold the State responsible for something new.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.893" offset="4867030">So the question is why do we have this twilight zone under Teague and why should it continue today, and the answer again is because Teague doesn't exist in a vacuum; it works in tandem with Griffith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.951" offset="4907259">Remember, what Griffith said is that it violates basic norms of constitutional adjudication for a defendant to not get the credit for a decision that this court announces before his State conviction becomes final.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.925" offset="4955220">So Teague is necessary as the other side of the coin to make Griffith work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.560" offset="4973714">And to undo all of that and to go back to an unsettled state of retroactivity law, whether it's Linkletter or something else, is going to really cause problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="1250.883" offset="5111014">Take the typical case, and maybe you will put in your mind, for example, the Martinez oral argument you had last week.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.954" offset="5135256">A typical case works its way through the State courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1265.977" offset="5171409">Then what might happen quite often is the State Supreme Court is going to hear, like this Court does, maybe one or two of those claims and address them on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.083" offset="5203801">Then he's going to go into State collateral review and bring an IAC claim, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and maybe whatever other claim he couldn't have brought earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.521" offset="5237551">Under the State's rule, you have three different retroactivity cutoffs for different claims that are brought and adjudicated at the different parts of that regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.377" offset="5276944">You have a retroactivity cutoff at the intermediate court for certain claims, a retroactivity cutoff at the Pennsylvania -- I'm sorry; the State Supreme Court for certain other claims; and a retroactivity cutoff in finality for certain other claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1652.019" offset="6715559">He has a number of existing habeas doctrines to rely on: Causing prejudice, actual innocence, inadequate State grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.910" offset="6755056">And he is quite likely in the Teague exception case to be able to get through the default of not having had an adjudication in State court and he will have not only review in Federal court, but he will have de novo review in Federal court, because there was no ruling on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.003" offset="6815451">So not only will he have Federal court review, but it won't be deferential review in that circumstance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2416.652" offset="9774080">The State thought it had a strong argument on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.004" offset="9783484">That's exactly what happened in Horn v. Banks, as well, Your Honor, which is a case that actually supports our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.408" offset="9813055">In that case, the State court applied on collateral review the rule of Mills v. Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.812" offset="9834684">Now this Court later held in that same case that Mills was a new rule that would be Teague-barred, but the State didn't know that at that time, and the State had a well established body of law applying Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.369" offset="9880973">And thought -- the State thought it could reasonably dispose of the claim on merits of the Mills issue, so it did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.939" offset="9907200">The case came to Federal habeas corpus review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.325" offset="9920784">It wouldn't have been barred, review on the merits would not have been barred by 2254 because the State collateral review court applied Mills and made a merits determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.597" offset="9961848">So the defendant would have been entitled to merits review under the deferential standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.566" offset="9977731">The problem is Mills was a new rule and so the independent bar of Teague comes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.989" offset="10003435">The Third Circuit refused to apply that independent bar; that's why this Court reversed in Horn v. Banks; and so it neatly many illustrates another example of a situation where Teague actually does survive despite 2254.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.630" offset="10057979">There are other doctrines that, based on this Court's case law, that have been overshadowed to an even greater extent than Teague was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.335" offset="10092774">Abuse of the writ, the Keeney v. Tomayo-Reyes concerning evidentiary hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.639" offset="10110015">Certainly Congress had the right to do that, and in fact these issues were addressed to some degree even in the court's seminal deference case in Williams v. Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.178" offset="10156199">In Williams v. Taylor for example, it was Justice Stevens' position in dissent, arguing in dissent, that the statute really only embodied Teague.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.886" offset="10199040">When the statute said clearly established all that Congress meant to do was to codify Teague.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.742" offset="10230387">He said it was perfectly clear that that was the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.278" offset="10244598">And he argued, particularly in footnote 12 of his dissenting portion of his opinion in Williams v. Taylor, just as Petitioner argues today that the fact that Congress in other portions of AEDPA, particularly in section 2244, used language talking about finality of judgment and talking about retroactivity, the fact that Congress did that in 2254 means that it was thinking about Teague and that it really meant to extend the Teague rule throughout the entire statute, that Teague really flavored the entire statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.682" offset="10382211">The Court necessarily rejected that argument, and in fact in reference to another prior case of this Court, Wright v. West that had been argued by Justice Stevens in his dissent, Justice O'Connor speaking for the Court said:</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.608" offset="10445949">"Congress need not mention a prior decision of this Court by name in a statute's text in order to adopt a rule. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.512" offset="10473535">Now I think that's clearly what Congress did, and I think it's -- that the Court clearly recognized in Williams v. Taylor that the deference rule, 2254, constituted a new rule which sat side by side with Teague and operated in different ways even if in some cases, many cases that mean you never have to get to the Teague bar, because the 2254-bar came into play first or more easily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.531" offset="10585548">If there are no further questions, I will rely on my brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2654.935" offset="10727236">But this case is all about a situation where the defendant does everything he is supposed to do, everything he can do, but it just so happens that this Court's decision has come down after the last State court decision on the merits, and the State on collateral review has refused -- if it's been given a chance -- to remedy that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.630" offset="10790034">The three cases I cited to you, at least one of them involves a situation where the defendant did go back to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.784" offset="10810619">And I believe it is the Graham case, and said apply this to me -- the State of Virginia said no, you are barred from State collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.104" offset="10835905">So all those doctrines do is allow the defendant to get in the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.656" offset="10850116">Once he's in the door, he still has to satisfy 2254(d)(1), which says that no claim shall be granted -- no -- habeas relief shall not be granted on any claim unless the language we have been talking about today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.233" offset="10908421">So the only way out of the problem that we have phrased is to say that Teague decides what is clearly established law, not the language of the statute itself, under the State's reading of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.874" offset="10954919">The second thing is, as to this Court's GVR practice -- I don't think there is much doubt, in all fairness--</text>

            <text syncTime="2738.441" offset="11061185">Then you go to the Teague -- you go to the exceptions in AEDPA for new claims, and whether actual innocence applies, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.762" offset="11082501">All those are merely gateways to the question of whether defendant gets relief which is controlled by 2254(d).</text>

            <text syncTime="2827.146" offset="11416033">The decision on the merits would have been earlier in the proceedings, when you argued I can't be executed because I was 17 when I committed the crime, and a State would have rejected that before Roeper, and then you end up after Roeper, a State saying we won't hear this on collateral review because we've already heard it once.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.723" offset="11474338">And then we have the situation we have today, and the only way out of that situation is to understand that Teague continues to control what is clearly established law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.745" offset="11506416">It is not just a problem -- again, it goes back to the structure of the whole statute, because the question this Court is supposed to be asking itself is, is there clear and specific language in the new statute to think that Congress wanted to dispense with Teague?</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.403" offset="11557094">And this is very clear indication that no -- that's not what Congress had in mind, that's not what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.492" offset="11585411">And so this is a case not just about habeas law, but also this Court's relationship with Congress, about whether Congress clearly had the kind of intent that is necessary.</text>
