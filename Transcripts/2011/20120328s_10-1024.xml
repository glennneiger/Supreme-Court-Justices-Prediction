            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="9.206" offset="141228">The question in this case is whether a plaintiff, who sues the Federal Government under the Privacy Act, may recover damages for nonpecuniary injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.992" offset="180412">Respondent is a pilot who intentionally withheld from the Federal Aviation Administration information about his HIV diagnosis in order to procure a medical certificate at a time when the agency did not issue medial certificates to pilots with HIV.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.094" offset="252824">Respondent's failure to report his condition was discovered in the course a joint criminal investigation by the Department of Transportation, which is the FAA's current agency, and the Social Security Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.817" offset="307681">When the investigation revealed that respondent had obtained Social Security disability benefits, but had nevertheless renewed his medical certificate, he admitted that he had deliberately failed to disclose information about his condition to the FAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.425" offset="370061">He eventually pleaded guilty to making and delivering a false official writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.382" offset="389914">He then brought this suit against the agencies involved in the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.376" offset="405901">He claims that the disclosure of his confidential medical information to the Department of Transportation violated the Privacy Act, causing him mental and emotional distress.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.530" offset="454489">The Privacy Act authorizes aggrieved individuals to recover "actual damages" from the Government for intentional or willful violation, but the Acts does not define actual damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.481" offset="506316">Relying on the sovereign immunity canon which holds that the scope of sovereign immunity waivers must be restrictly construed in the Government's favor, the District Court held that the term "actual damages" is facially ambiguous and that as a result, respondent could not recover for his alleged nonpecuniary harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.974" offset="588340">The Ninth Circuit reversed, however, holding that in the context of the Privacy Act the meaning of "actual damages" is clear and that it includes mental and emotional distress.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.315" offset="633689">For reasons stated in our opinion, we hold that the Privacy Act does not unmistakably authorize damages for mental and emotional distress.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.484" offset="670365">We are most persuaded by what Congress did not authorize to be recovered for Privacy Act violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.106" offset="696801">Congress deliberately excluded general damages from the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.749" offset="715400">In common law defamation and privacy cases, general damages compensate for nonpecuniary harm, including mental and emotional distress and need not be proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.881" offset="759912">The only other category of compensatory damages in those common law torts is special damages which are limited to actual pecuniary loss and must be proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.090" offset="808709">Because Congress refused to authorize general damages, we believe that it is reasonable to infer that Congress intended the term "actual damages" under the Privacy Act to mean special damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.541" offset="858551">Respondent's contrary reading of the Act is not unreasonable, but because Congress did not speak unequivocally, the sovereign immunity can and dictates that we adopt an interpretation of actual damages limited to proven pecuniary loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.462" offset="918215">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is therefore reversed and the case is remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.563" offset="938695">Justice Sotomayor has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.400" offset="965966">Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision in this case.</text>
