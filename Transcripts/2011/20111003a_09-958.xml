            <text syncTime="15.943" offset="167163">There are many reasons why this Court should not recognize a private cause of action to enforce 30(A) and I would like to focus on three.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.913" offset="195062">First, the separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.948" offset="203212">Congress controls who can enforce Federal law, and it has not provided for -- for private enforcement of 30(A).</text>
            <text syncTime="32.637" offset="233932">Instead it has provided for administrative enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.871" offset="242813">Second is the Spending Clause context in which the case arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.625" offset="257860">The very legitimacy of Spending Clause legislation depends on the State's voluntary and knowing acceptance of its obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.779" offset="290461">For this reason, if Congress wants to provide for private party litigation, it must do so clear and unambiguously, and it has not done so in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.801" offset="326614">And third is the language of 30(A) itself, which is broad and undefined and which includes competing policy interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.305" offset="360573">These are suited to administrative enforcement, with all the expertise and judgment and discretion and administrative know-how that can be brought to bear.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.060" offset="395577">These three principles all focus -- all point to one conclusion -- that section 30(A) is not enforceable.</text>

            <text syncTime="147.645" offset="694000">Very rarely, and the reason for that is because the way that most State plan amendments operate is that these issues are resolved on a consensual basis, generally within the 90 days provided by regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="165.237" offset="764322">Well, Ms. Schwartz, isn't it the exception because in fact you end-run -- end-ran the administrative process, that you put your regulations, your new rate schedules, into effect even before you submitted them to HHS, and continued them in effect while HHS was considering them, and continued them in effect to the extent that you were allowed to do so by injunction, even after HSS disapproved them?</text>

            <text syncTime="192.737" offset="874350">There is no end run here because HHS's own regulations provide that our time for submitting the State -- State plan amendment is within the 90 days that the amendment will take effect, and HHS will confirm that -- it's the position of the Federal Government that the State may implement its rate reductions while the State plan amendment is pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.051" offset="959613">It does so at the risk that, if a State plan amendment is disapproved, that it may have to pay additional funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.038" offset="987512">But we did not do an end run around anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="270.953" offset="1187192">You -- you introduce the fact or the consideration of what's administratively workable.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.107" offset="1211852">The brief by the former HHS officials says quite to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.409" offset="1232959">It -- it says that there are almost $400 billion of HHS expenditures that are supervised by 50 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.515" offset="1265455">That works out to 800 million each; and they say, we don't have time for this, and it's much more efficient and it's much more consistent with the application of -- proper application of Federal law, to allow this action be brought in the -- in the courts.</text>

            <label>Ms. Karin S. Schwartz</label>
            <text syncTime="306.358" offset="1328776">I have two answers, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.393" offset="1336926">One is that I don't think it is more efficient to have 700 district court judges interpreting a statute that does not have any objective standard, but that is susceptible to many different interpretations.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="318.882" offset="1378931">Well, I mean, that's 7 -- 700 judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.550" offset="1393560">It would be just each district if it were in every district.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.438" offset="1409128">And it -- it -- and certainly to the extent we are involving a State, there would be only one State involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.394" offset="1444968">So -- so there is just the State of California and only four districts there and the suit could only be brought in one.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.579" offset="1465657">So -- I think that's an -- you know, I don't think that the "sky is falling" argument really works.</text>

            <label>Ms. Karin S. Schwartz</label>
            <text syncTime="346.935" offset="1491153">But California is now subject to standards that don't apply anywhere else in the country, and I believe the Court acknowledged exactly this problem just last term in Astra v. Santa Clara when it declined to allow private parties to use a contract provision to do an end run around Gonzaga, Sandoval versus -- Sandoval v. Alexander; I think I have that reversed -- and the other cases that, based on separation of powers of principles, based on Spending Clause principles, limit the -- the circumstances in which private parties can sue.</text>

            <text syncTime="392.964" offset="1675264">One, Congress hasn't created a cause of action here.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.797" offset="1686549">Well, Congress has never created causes of action, never creates a cause of action in any case in the Ex parte Young line or cases like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.771" offset="1722493">The Supremacy Clause, because this is a Spending Clause, this was an act under the Spending Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.858" offset="1750810">But you are not asking us to hold that a Spending Clause legislation can never preempt State legislation, I take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.496" offset="1777351">And then the language of 30(A), where you -- are you arguing that 30 -- that the Medicaid Act affirmatively precludes any action like this.</text>

            <text syncTime="428.970" offset="1819251">Is -- is any of those arguments sufficient by itself, or do you have to take them all together, and you are asking for a rule that only applies here?</text>

            <text syncTime="437.243" offset="1852374">All of those arguments are sufficient, as is the fact that, as we briefed, the Supremacy Cause itself is an implied cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.913" offset="1887065">But let me focus on those three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.731" offset="1894275">These are points -- the rule that we are seeking is that a Federal statute is not enforceable unless Congress intended for it to be enforceable, and that that principle has special force with respect to Spending Clause provisions where Congress has to clearly and unambiguously provide for that enforcement, because the State has to be on fair notice due to the nature of the Spending Clause of the obligations to which it is agreeing.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.083" offset="1995734">That is Pennhurst; and that is applied with even greater force with respect to 30(A) because of the type of standards that it incorporates.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.521" offset="2033455">If it's not suitable for -- if a determination applying Gonzaga if that if you are finding under 1983 the administrative nature and flexible nature of those standards is not appropriate for private enforcement, that shouldn't matter what vehicle you are using to bring the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.531" offset="2101478">And I want to just -- to put this into real clear context, in the 3 years that this case has been pending, California has submitted 68 State plan amendments outside of the rate context.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.456" offset="2153200">36 of them were approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.992" offset="2163336">The rest were withdrawn voluntarily.</text>

            <text syncTime="1650.602" offset="6705821">That is true and I didn't hear anything from the other side that suggests anything to the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1673.281" offset="6796518">And under this Court's decision in Ex parte Young, what the Court said was an injunction which restrains the State from taking any steps to the enforcement of an unconstitutional enactment to the injury of the complainant is the basis for relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="3226.515" offset="13009481">It doesn't need to figure out exactly how far Congress could deal with the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.669" offset="13026095">I realize that there is some skepticism on that score.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.286" offset="13036544">But on the core question here, did Congress intend to deprive these plaintiffs of their rights under Ex parte Young?</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.541" offset="13065488">The answer is no.</text>

            <text syncTime="3241.807" offset="13070608">The answer is yes, they intended to deprive them of the right to sue under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.592" offset="13093700">I understand that you're not challenging the proposition that this statute, when Congress was specifically focused on the question of how to enforce this provision, they did not provide a right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.583" offset="13137690">And under our implied right of action jurisprudence, that means there isn't one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.952" offset="13151169">So why when they are confronted with the precise question did they say no, we don't want these people to sue, but you say well, they knew under the Constitution they were going to be able to anyway?</text>

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="3272.076" offset="13191711">Because there is a difference between providing a private right of action and all the bells and whistles that go with that, as opposed to recognizing that Ex parte Young is the background principle that has been in place for well over a century, and that it says that when the standards for equitable relief are satisfied, the Courts have the power, and they can prevent the violation of the Supremacy Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="3311.301" offset="13348551">Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I would have been perfectly comfortable with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.253" offset="13364433">I mean, that was one of the alternative grounds for relief that we sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.288" offset="13376554">The district judge didn't happen to go down that particular path.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.140" offset="13387943">But clearly from our perspective, the important element is to maintain the status quo ante until a resolution of the legality of California statute can be made, either by the agency or the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.881" offset="13434859">But the one thing you shouldn't be allowed to do is simply to -- to permit this to drift without any remedy and without any ability to get access to medical care that's clearly consistent with what Congress intended, and where a remedy is available under the Ex parte Young formulation.</text>

            <label>Ms. Karin S. Schwartz</label>
            <text syncTime="3356.080" offset="13527646">Thank you, Your Honor, so there are other provisions of the Medicaid Act that are privately enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.817" offset="13550634">This one is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.717" offset="13554291">I've would like to address the court's questions about Ex parte Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.954" offset="13567143">Ex parte Young of course involved a Constitution -- the Due Process Clause and not the Supremacy Clause of the substance of the Constitution that was being enforced and the plaintiff had an independent pre-standing personal right in ex parte Young in all of the cases that are its progeny.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.915" offset="13639032">Now there is another -- I want to address Justice Alito's point about do we apply the right's required in Ex parte Young causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.621" offset="13677902">Yes you do, Alexander v. Sandoval, California v. Sierra Club, Blessing versus Freestone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.508" offset="13701413">Look at Alexander v. Sandoval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.543" offset="13709563">The State passes a constitutional amendment that says English only.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.512" offset="13725445">The State adopts a policy, English-only drivers tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.233" offset="13744253">This is challenged as conflicting with Federal law and specifically a Federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.768" offset="13762435">The Court said no court is satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.355" offset="13780825">Congress drafted that statute, it controls who gets to enforce them.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="3425.658" offset="13806007">I'm sorry Ms. Schwartz.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.308" offset="13812590">Are you saying -- this is the way I understood you and tell me if I am right: Are you saying that the test for determining whether there is a 1983 suit is the same as the test for determining whether there is an Ex parte Young action?</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.133" offset="13859924">Because you talked about whether somebody has a right, which is usually the language we use in the 1983 context.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="karin_s_schwartz" startTime="3447.156" stopTime="3600.689">
            <label>Ms. Karin S. Schwartz</label>
            <text syncTime="3447.156" offset="13892002">No, I'm not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.872" offset="13894823">The test for whether there is an Ex parte -- there is different means of Ex parte Young, but none of them apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.476" offset="13917288">You can see Ex parte Young as construing a cause of action under the Due Process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.547" offset="13933589">This not a cause of action under the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.499" offset="13945396">You can see Ex parte Young as involving a specific kind of bill in equity which is a defense of regulation of your conduct where that regulation infringes a personal or property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.223" offset="13992312">That is not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.639" offset="13997955">There is no regulation of Respondent's conduct and there is no infringement of a personal or property right in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.210" offset="14024182">The only entity that's being regulated by the State -- by the State statute that purportedly is being -- well, that is being challenged as preempted, is the state of California itself because we are the entity that sets rates and so the statute tells the agency, this is how you will set rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.339" offset="14088756">So however you look at ex parte Young, plaintiffs cannot satisfy the elements of an ex parte Young cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.860" offset="14126791">What I'm saying with respect to Alexander v. Sandoval and these other cases is injury is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.848" offset="14146748">You have to have a -- a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.800" offset="14162526">Under equity injury, it's never been enough, and it's not enough under this Court's separation of powers decisions and its Spending Clause cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.239" offset="14200351">And I wanted to segue very quickly to this idea that there is a default rule that a Supremacy Clause cause of action exists by default the.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.778" offset="14234520">That is absolutely not true, and it's not true in this context, and I'd like to identify two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.980" offset="14251342">First, the Suter fix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.949" offset="14259179">The -- Congress acted in this Court in Suter, said that there was no cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.104" offset="14287809">And it said just because something is in a -- in an estate plan, doesn't render it unenforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.841" offset="14314768">But we want to preserve the holding in Suter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.377" offset="14324903">Look, it -- That suggests that other things are unenforceable; that Congress is not act -- legislating against a backdrop of an assumption that there is an injunctive relief to the claim, or it wouldn't have required it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.035" offset="14375476">In Maine v. Thibotout, another case that assumes, that recognizes that with respect to spending clause actions, the sole means -- the Spending Clause statute, the means, the vehicle for enforcing is 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.778" offset="14434513">And finally, in the Spending Clause context, we have the clear state role which is incompatible with the assumption that a cause of action always exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.383" offset="14464920">Because the State has to have knowing and acceptance -- knowing and accepting its obligations, we require that they reassert statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.822" offset="14502640">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
