            <text syncTime="41.843" offset="273545">Assuming for the sake of argument that some of us might be interested in whether a line should be created for juveniles who intended or didn't intend death, with respect to their eligibility for life without parole, whether it's mandatory or voluntary, how would we write that?</text>
            <text syncTime="67.809" offset="377408">Would -- would we just import all the Enmund and Tison jurisprudence?</text>

            <text syncTime="78.350" offset="419622">In fact, in Graham, the Court makes these statements that they're trying to exempt and shield juveniles who did not kill, quote,</text>

            <text syncTime="89.141" offset="462776">And that language could be a basis for organizing the Court's thinking on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.376" offset="483674">And, obviously, in this case where there wasn't a requirement of the specific intent to kill that was required in the Alabama case, that -- that might dictate a certain different outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.001" offset="526201">I think the challenge with that is that juvenile status, juvenile intent, is a much more complicated issue, and that for many of the same reasons that are problematic with how kids function at the first stage of these trials, it would be hard--</text>

            <text syncTime="156.034" offset="730375">Now, it's true that in -- in Arkansas under this provision an adult would still be subject to the death penalty, because they used this "recklessness" language so that even a focus on "intent to kill" that we addressed in Enmund might not categorically protect these other juveniles, which I think the Court can rightly acknowledge have diminished culpability.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.363" offset="815638">It's also worth noting that in many of these States where there are children being sentenced to life without parole, there is no confusion about this.</text>

            <text syncTime="293.840" offset="1281558">In most jurisdictions, I would think if -- if someone's charged with the highest degree of homicide, the defense can request an instruction on -- you don't have to have a separate charge on a lesser included offense; the defense can request an instruction on lesser included offenses if it could be supported by the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="317.290" offset="1375390">For example, one of our provisions in Alabama makes the -- the crime sort of a -- a homicide a capital crime if the victim is under the age of 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.545" offset="1408409">You're not entitled to some diminished culpability, some other kind of homicide charge unless there's something else going on that would support that.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.901" offset="1441846">Our laws and this Court's law say there has to be evidence in support of that lesser included instruction before the court is constitutionally obligated to provide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.421" offset="1471939">And so, for that reason, it's not a given that that would happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.373" offset="1487717">And I think the challenge with the mandatory scheme that we've been talking about in both of these cases is that it does put the sentencer in a very difficult situation, where there is no ability to consider the age; there is no ability to consider the factual diminished culpability that might exist in one case or the other; no ability in either of these cases to consider the fact that an older codefendant got a lesser sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.322" offset="1579459">That there is something else going on here that -- that goes beyond just the particulars of this crime and this particular offender's culpability.</text>

            <text syncTime="911.508" offset="3752219">I think two nonrandom arguments can be made for the two ages.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.645" offset="3772804">I will start with the young age of 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.664" offset="3780850">When you consider the fact that 13 jurisdictions have thought about this, and have all but one set the age above 14, I think we can then rely on that to make a determination that if there is a minimum age, it's above 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.588" offset="3836543">I think we can also, consistent with this Court's precedents, look at the frequency of the sentence for this population.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.494" offset="3864233">Most States have never sentenced a child to life without parole for a crime at 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.479" offset="3884086">They've just never done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.581" offset="3888579">32 States, there are no children 14 and younger serving life without parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.883" offset="3905715">And so, I think that allows this Court in a very nonrandom way to defend that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.437" offset="3927971">But I also think a nonrandom argument can be made to draw the line at 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.424" offset="3947929">That is offenders under the age of 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.943" offset="3957960">That's exactly what this Court has done in Roper, it's what this Court has done in Graham.</text>

            <text syncTime="998.549" offset="4100379">And the fact that 18-year-olds or 17-year-olds in many respects are quite mature or at least can be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.703" offset="4125039">And so that makes 18 seem not quite right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1019.613" offset="4184703">But I want to just stress that they are less meaningful here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.414" offset="4195883">Because with mandatory sentences, they don't tell you the same thing they do in these other contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.383" offset="4215736">But I also think it's true that we have recognized that up until the age of 18, you are a juvenile, your status is coherent with what the Court has recognized in these other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.191" offset="4258995">And so I do think it's defensible there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.193" offset="4266936">While it's true that you are more developed than a child of 14 or a child of 10, it's also true that you are not an adult.</text>

            <text syncTime="1067.443" offset="4376024">Well, yes, this Court in Thompson made a distinction between offenders that were under the age of 15, 15 and younger, then older offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.947" offset="4402041">And for 20 some years, the law in this country was you could not subject younger offenders to the death penalty in ways that you could older offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.436" offset="4431926">And so there is clearly precedent for that and we have appended also lots of statutes, I mean, that also make those kinds of distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.607" offset="4460660">I mean, we do draw these lines frequently in a range of areas, not just dealing with the constitutional questions that we are dealing with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.046" offset="4490440">But just kind of to complete my analysis, Justice Kagan, about these comparisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.015" offset="4506218">The other point that I will reference is that in Thompson, this Court was also struggling over this question about frequency and rarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.837" offset="4537565">And what the Court did there was actually look at the number of juveniles that were sentenced to death under the age of 16 that were on death row and compared them to the number of people on death row at the time, and they noted that it was.36 percent of the population of people on death row.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.049" offset="4610394">If you did the same thing here, the Sentencing Project reports that there are over 41,000 people in the United States serving sentences of life imprisonment without parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.653" offset="4644771">And if you compare our number of 79 to that, that is actually again a lower proportion of people serving life without parole than the Court found to be constitutionally significant in Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.361" offset="4687612">So I think Thompson and Coker all reinforce what we are saying here, that this is an exceedingly rare sentence where the majority of States have never chose to impose it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.416" offset="4727841">That would provide a basis for this Court to conclude that it is cruel and unusual.</text>

            <text syncTime="1241.155" offset="5070776">I don't mean to concede that it's an irrelevant question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.457" offset="5084046">I think the Court absolutely can and should conclude that there is diminished culpability in the Jackson case, and that is evident based on the facts in the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.229" offset="5119155">Actually it was the dissenter in -- in the Jackson case that made this observation about the consequences of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.633" offset="5144755">And, of course, for many non-homicide crimes there are these kind of fortuities that sometimes prevent death wonderfully, and we were grateful for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.339" offset="5179550">My problem is that the differences between children and adults, these internal attributes, if you will, these deficits in judgment are not crime specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.377" offset="5219674">The person who intends to kill doesn't actually have any better judgment, any more character, any more maturity, any more impulse control than the person who doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.835" offset="5265545">And a way of characterizing a rule would be to recognize that and to create a categorical ban.</text>

            <text syncTime="1311.016" offset="5350286">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.467" offset="5364079">The decision below falls squarely within the framework of Roper and Graham, and there are three reasons to affirm this judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.789" offset="5393336">First, murder is the worst of all crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.758" offset="5405248">Society has drawn that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.027" offset="5414339">Second, legislatures have the power to authorize sentences that are commensurate with crimes like murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.631" offset="5444745">Third, Jackson has not demonstrated any consensus in this case against the practice, and in fact, there is a supermajority of States and of governments that authorize this sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.105" offset="5494587">The landscape of this case is -- is different than Graham, because in Graham no one was -- no one was killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.292" offset="5527397">Terrence Graham was lucky no one was killed, because he acted with a reckless disregard for human life as well, but it's an important thing in our law that the law punishes the -- the result, the harm that is inflicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.968" offset="5582045">And if I could, go to the Arkansas statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.003" offset="5598241">Jackson was charged with the highest crime you could be charged with in Arkansas, it was capital felony murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.442" offset="5631991">In that the legislature has set out several enumerated, several violent felonies that if you commit this particular crime -- and aggravated robbery is one of them -- if you commit that crime and in the course and furtherance of that, you or an accomplice act with extreme indifference to the value of human life during the commission of it or in the flight from it, then you are guilty of capital felony murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.343" offset="5739615">So, in this case the jury was called upon, because there were other accomplices with Kuntrell Jackson, they were called on to determine whether or not Kuntrell Jackson acted as an accomplice, whether he aided and assisted and whether or not he or an accomplice acted with extreme indifference to the value of human life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.127" offset="5838672">In that process, Kuntrell Jackson asserted the affirmative defense that essentially is available for capital murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.099" offset="5882557">He said that, I did not have -- I was not the triggerman, and I did not -- I did not commit the homicide offense, and I did not aid or procure counsel, all of those are listed -- the exact words of the affirmative defense are listed in our brief at page 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.496" offset="5956223">And -- but he asserted that defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.115" offset="5970642">The Arkansas Supreme Court noted in its opinion that in his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, that there was sufficient evidence to convict him of capital murder and that the jury was well within its right to believe that he said that he -- that when he walked in and took -- took the lead in this robbery that he said, "We ain't playing", and after that the clerk responded that she was going to call the police--</text>

            <text syncTime="2356.203" offset="9531028">But a person who is an adult who is faced with the death penalty, which is certainly a strong statement along your lines, is permitted by the Constitution nonetheless to make any mitigating argument he wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.731" offset="9597170">And Arkansas has to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2378.635" offset="9620784">And so, the argument here is basically, well, the same is true when a 14-year-old, because of the lack of maturity, faces life without parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.709" offset="9673029">And that seems to be the hard issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.178" offset="9686926">Just as -- just as the death penalty is unique for anyone and therefore requires mitigating elements, isn't the life without parole special enough for an adolescent that you have to let him at least make any mitigating arguments he wants?</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.739" offset="9761114">Now, Arkansas hasn't really expressed a view in its legislation on that question, or maybe it has and just rejected it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2526.498" offset="10212197">But he only received one diminishment in his -- in his punishment, because he had -- he was -- he had twice-diminished culpability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.853" offset="10249604">In this particular case, Jackson does not have twice-diminished culpability.</text>

            <text syncTime="2544.443" offset="10283981">Even if he were to -- even if we were to say that, well, he didn't pull the trigger, or we can't show that he didn't -- that he acted -- didn't act with reckless indifference -- even if we were to say that that was twice-diminished, he is still criminally responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.719" offset="10345108">There's not a -- there's not a special class of not guilty by reason of youth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.688" offset="10364961">He is still criminally responsible for what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.824" offset="10381470">And -- and a teenager -- teenagers must know that if you commit the worst crime, you will get the worst punishment that's available under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.764" offset="10417310">And so, the symmetry here is that -- that Terrence Graham was the lucky one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.901" offset="10437790">It's not that Kuntrell Jackson was the unlucky one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.368" offset="10447717">This is a -- when you go into a place with a sawed-off shotgun, it's a dangerous activity; it's inherently dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.524" offset="10476347">And what was left out of the calculus a minute -- a few minutes ago was the fact that he could -- it's not just kill or intend to kill, but foresee what could happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.565" offset="10520441">And certainly the evidence in this case demonstrated that Kuntrell Jackson could foresee that at an armed robbery, someone could get hurt.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bryan A. Stevenson</label>
            <text syncTime="2623.393" offset="10599749">Just -- just a few points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.097" offset="10614587">Justice Kennedy, I just want to kind of remark, there is some literature out there about commutation in Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.482" offset="10636112">And it was actually quite common up until 1980, and this case that my colleague referenced was prior to that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.905" offset="10661816">But since then, it's been very uncommon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.505" offset="10672265">There's only been one commutation since 2007 with the current governor, and that was for a non-homicide offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.460" offset="10704030">I -- I also want to say, but just kind of consistent with my earlier argument, that this Court did strike down mandatory death sentences in Woodson v. North Carolina and Roberts v. Louisiana for many of the reasons that the Court has highlighted here that made that sentence unconstitutional and inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.805" offset="10769441">And we think that in the same way, the Court could certainly do that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.607" offset="10784592">But my final point is really to just say we are not suggesting that States should not be able to impose very harsh punishments and very severe sentences on even children who commit these kinds of violent crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.948" offset="10837986">That's not our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.200" offset="10843001">The State of Arkansas and the State of Alabama have parole boards in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.752" offset="10861183">They can even impose sentences that give them the authority to maintain control of the lives of these children for the rest of their natural lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.257" offset="10891276">What we are arguing is that they cannot do so with no hope of release, that that would be incompatible with child status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.013" offset="10922309">And that's the rule of Roper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.763" offset="10929206">That's the logic of Roper and Graham.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.899" offset="10937774">It could be argued that every person is more than the worst thing they've ever done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.467" offset="10956059">And a policymaker and a decisionmaker might consider that in constructing what kind of sentences to impose and what kind of regime to create, and that's totally up to the legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.325" offset="10995557">But what this Court has said is that children are uniquely more than their worst act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.462" offset="11016037">They are quintessentially children in a way that the Constitution requires that we respect their child status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.732" offset="11049160">And our argument is simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.251" offset="11055220">Our argument is that it would be unusual to recognize that in virtually every area of the law but when a crime is committed, to simply abandon it, to simply ignore it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.357" offset="11095658">Roper and Graham teach us that we can't do that consistently with our Eighth Amendment prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.761" offset="11117287">And so, for that reason, it is unusual, and it's our judgment that it would be cruel to declare these children fit only to die in prison given what we now know about their status, about their development, and about their potential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.685" offset="11172980">And for those reasons, we would ask this Court to reverse the lower court judgments and grant relief in this case, Jackson v. Arkansas.</text>
