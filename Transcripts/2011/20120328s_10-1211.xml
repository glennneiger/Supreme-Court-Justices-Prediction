            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="107520">Justice Ginsburg has our opinion this morning in Case 10-1211, Vartelas versus Holder.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="9.967" offset="147331">Petitioner Vartelas, a native of Greece, became a lawful permanent resident in 1989.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.887" offset="194978">He pleaded guilty to conspiring to make counterfeit travelers' checks in 1994 and he served a prison term of four months.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.318" offset="236774">At the time of his plea, an alien with a conviction like his could travel abroad for brief periods without jeopardizing his resident alien status.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.315" offset="292780">Vartelas did so, travelling occasionally to Greece, both before and after serving his prison sentence to assist his aging parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.312" offset="348682">In 1996, Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act commonly known as IIRIRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.516" offset="397584">Under that Act, aliens who have committed certain crimes, among them, counterfeiting, may be stopped from entering the United States when they return from a trip abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.391" offset="453068">By travelling and returning, they risk loss of their permanent resident status and are in danger of becoming excluded aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.870" offset="506984">Vartelas was so stopped in 2003 and was placed under an order permanently removing him from the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.149" offset="548049">This case presents a question of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.547" offset="565708">Does IIRIRA reach back and apply to aliens like Vartelas, who committed a crime before IIRIRA's effective date?</text>
            <text syncTime="129.684" offset="626207">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that IIRIRA applied to Vartelas and affirmed the removal order.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.683" offset="666227">We reverse that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.106" offset="675944">Applying IIRIRA to Vartelas rather than the law that governed at the time of his conviction would retroactively attach a new disability to his prior offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.588" offset="733832">Our decisions, however, have long applied a presumption against retroactive legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.231" offset="764343">We read laws as operating prospectively only, unless Congress has instructed their application to past events.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.206" offset="808333">The IIRIRA provision in question, the Government acknowledges, does not say anything about its temporal reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.026" offset="843546">We hold that it does not apply to Vartelas' pre-IIRIRA conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.590" offset="873848">Beyond doubt, IIRIRA's entry bar would impose a severe disability on lawful permanent residents like Vartelas.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.510" offset="929541">Loss of the freedom to travel abroad, for example, to fulfill his obligations attend births, weddings or funerals of family members, attend to financial interests or to respond to a family emergency, those are harsh penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.805" offset="1010730">The Government argues that Congress has attached no disability to the past conduct of residents, like Vartelas, rather the Government says, “The relevant event is not Vartelas' pre-IIRIRA criminal offense, it is his post-IIRIRA act of returning to the United States after travel abroad,” but we disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.619" offset="1125982">True, Vartelas' return to the United States from a week of caring for his parents in Greece occasioned his treatment as a newcomer to our shores, but the reason for his detention and the disability imposed on him was not his lawful foreign travel, it was his pre-IIRIRA conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.898" offset="1231099">The Second Circuit ruled that IIRIRA's -- IIRIRA's entry bar did not apply retroactivity -- retroactively to Vartelas because he, in no way, relied on immigration laws when he committed the counterfeiting offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.198" offset="1308212">This reasoning is doubly fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.515" offset="1321482">First, as the Government acknowledges, our decisions in point do not require a party challenging the retroactive application of a statute to show reliance on the prior law in arranging his conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.133" offset="1388042">Second, Vartelas likely did rely on existing immigration law when he pleaded guilty to the counterfeiting offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.970" offset="1427331">There can be little doubt, we observed in the recent decision that alien defendants considering whether to enter into a plea agreement ordinarily are acutely aware of the immigration consequences of their convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.807" offset="1490651">For these reasons spelled out in full in the Court's opinion, we hold that Vartelas' reentry into the United States after a brief trip to Greece was governed not by IIRIRA, but by the legal regime in place at the time of his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.907" offset="1563063">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Thomas and Justice Alito join.</text>
