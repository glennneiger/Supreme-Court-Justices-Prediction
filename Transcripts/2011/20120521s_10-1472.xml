            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="106496">Justice Alito has our opinion this morning in Case 10-1472, Taniguchi versus Kan Pacific Saipan.</text>

            <label>Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="8.581" offset="140769">This case concerns the terms "interpreter" and "translator".</text>
            <text syncTime="12.647" offset="157069">A federal statute, 28 U.S.C. Section 1920 entitles the prevailing party in a civil case to recover certain costs from the loosing party.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.040" offset="198656">The Court Interpreters Act amended this provision to include "compensation of interpreters".</text>
            <text syncTime="29.519" offset="224569">The question here is whether compensation of interpreters covers the costs of producing English language versions of documents that are written in another language.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.600" offset="268873">This is a personal injury suit brought by a professional Japanese basketball player, Kouichi Taniguchi against the owner of a property on which the plaintiff was injured, Kan Pacific Saipan.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.954" offset="318297">The plaintiff lost the case and the District Court awarded costs to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.239" offset="339404">These costs included the expense of translating from Japanese to English certain documents that the defendant used in preparing its defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.348" offset="375871">The Ninth Circuit affirmed the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.785" offset="385588">It concluded that compensation of interpreters is not limited to the cost of translating live speech but reasonably encompasses the cost of translating written documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.743" offset="429369">We disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.734" offset="433340">Because the term "interpreter" is not defined in the statute, we give the word its ordinary meaning and it is not customary to speak of the interpretation of a written document from one language into another.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.778" offset="493526">Instead, the term that is customarily used is "translation".</text>
            <text syncTime="100.755" offset="509513">At the time of the statute's enactments -- enactment, dictionaries uniformly define "interpreter" to include persons who translate orally but only a handful define the word broadly enough to encompass translators of written materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.188" offset="571162">One of the few dictionaries in the latter category was the Oxford English Dictionary, but the OED's treatment is illustrative.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.471" offset="604285">The OED stated that the use of the term "interpret" to refer to the translation of written documents had become obsolete.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.120" offset="638976">Any definition of the word that is absent from many dictionaries and is deemed obsolete in others is hardly a common or ordinary meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.122" offset="674920">We, therefore, conclude that the term "interpreter" is normally understood as one who translates orally from one language to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.327" offset="703760">Nothing in the Court Interpreters Act or in other provisions of Section 1920 hints that Congress intended to go beyond this ordinary meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.689" offset="745242">All of this is explained in greater detail in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.594" offset="760811">For anyone who is interested, the opinion is written in English. Anybody [Laughter] who wants to read it in another language will have to pay to have it translated [Laughter] not interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.320" offset="803756">Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Breyer and Justice Sotomayor have joined.</text>
