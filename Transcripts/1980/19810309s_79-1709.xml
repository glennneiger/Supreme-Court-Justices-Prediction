            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="7.938" offset="123734">This case is here on petition for writ of certiorari to the Untied States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.211" offset="152887">The petitioners in this case entered into a single conspiracy that is an agreement among themselves which envisioned both the importation and the distribution of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.067" offset="200325">Their conspiracy was foiled by law enforcement officers and they were subsequently charged and convicted on a two-count indictment of conspiracy to import marijuana in violation of one statute in conspiracy to distribute marijuana in violation of another.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.509" offset="270020">They received consecutive sentences for each count.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.584" offset="286321">Petitioners don't contend that their conspiracy to import and distribute marijuana did not violate both of these statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.083" offset="324355">Instead they argue that Congress did not intend to authorize multiple punishments for violations of these two statutes in a case involving only a single agreement or conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.551" offset="374196">They also argued that even if Congress intended consecutive sentences to be imposed, imposition of such of a punishment violates the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.322" offset="425292">We hold today that Congress did intend to impose multiple punishments for violation of these two conspiracy statutes even in a case involving only a single agreement or conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.690" offset="474820">The provisions of the statute are unambiguous on their face and each authorizes punishment for a violation of its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.009" offset="512018">Moreover we have historically applied the rule of statutory construction announced in the well-known Blockburger case to determine congressional intent in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.862" offset="555486">The statutory provisions here clearly satisfy that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.060" offset="576280">Finally, we hold that imposition of consecutive sentences in this situation does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment where consecutive sentences are imposed to the single criminal trial, the role of a constitutional guarantee and limiting is limited to assuring that the Court does not exceed it's legislative authorization by imposition of multiple punishment for the same offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.862" offset="683486">The question of what punishments are constitutionally permissible is not different from the question of what punishment the legislative branch intended to impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.814" offset="727267">Where Congress intended as it did here to impose multiple punishment imposition of such sentence does not violate the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.167" offset="764675">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.230" offset="780975">Justice Stewart has filed an opinion concurring in the result in this case in which Justice Marshall and Justice Stevens joined.</text>
