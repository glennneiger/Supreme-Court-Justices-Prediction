            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="92064">The second case is here from the Georgia Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.044" offset="116201">The petitioners are three employees of an adult movie theater and bookstore who were convicted of distributing obscene materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.045" offset="164162">They were low level employees, not proprietors or managers of the establishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.412" offset="193628">Nevertheless they were sentenced to long periods of probation and subjected to heavy fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.726" offset="226960">Their probations later were revoked when they were unable to pay the fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.509" offset="250053">At that time, they were no longer employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.367" offset="265517">Throughout the proceedings below, petitioners were represented by a lawyer hired and paid for by their former employer, the owner and operator of the theater and bookstore.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.918" offset="323718">This employer had promised them to pay any fines that may be imposed as a result of their work for his establishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.522" offset="362066">But he failed to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.087" offset="372410">We granted this case to decide whether revocation of probation with resulting imprisonment solely because of inability to pay fines violated the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.893" offset="427581">Upon consideration of the case however, we concluded that the lawyer who had represented petitioners may have had a disqualifying conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.255" offset="473034">If in fact there were such a conflict, petitioners may have been denied due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.382" offset="501560">In view of this possibility we do not reach the equal protection issue rather we remand the case for the Georgia courts to determine whether in fact there was a disqualification of interest in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.826" offset="563313">Justice Stevens has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.297" offset="577210">Justice Brennan has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, in which Justice Marshall has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.655" offset="606676">Justice Stewart also has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.548" offset="630186">And Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
