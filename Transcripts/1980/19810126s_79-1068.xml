            <text syncTime="15.849" offset="155404">This case is here by way of the grant of a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.103" offset="188423">Title VII of the Civic Rights Act of 1964 limits the authority of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to make public disclosure of information it has obtained in investigating and attempting to resolve a claim of employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.944" offset="263760">We granted certiorari in this case to consider whether the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit was correct in holding that a prelitigation disclosure of information in a Commission file to the employee who filed the Title VII claim is a "public" disclosure within the meaning of the statutory restrictions.</text>
