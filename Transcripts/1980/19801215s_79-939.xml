            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="92075">In the next case, 79-939, Delaware State College against Ricks, a case here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.318" offset="161247">This involves the denial of academic tenure by Delaware State College to a faculty member.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.011" offset="188101">It presents a question as to the effective date of this denial for the purpose of deciding whether the faculty member suit was timely filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.412" offset="237629">He sought relief both under Title VII and under 42 U.S.C. (a), Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.497" offset="277962">The District Court dismissed respondent's complaint as untimely, but the Court of Appeals disagreed and reversed, the facts are set forth fully in our opinion filed today with the clerk and may not be stated in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.539" offset="346194">In brief summary, the faculty committee on promotions and tenure recommended denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.090" offset="372421">The full Faculty Senate agreed and the Board of Trustee is formally voted not to grant tenure. Respondent as permitted by college rules filed a grievance seeking reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.846" offset="439399">In due of the official denial of tenure, the Board in accordance with its normal practice offered respondent a 1-year terminal contract that respondent accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.555" offset="494256">The question before us was which of several days was determinative with respect to the running of statutes of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.502" offset="534067">We hold that the controlling date was no later than June 26, 1974 when respondent was advised formally of the official denial and that he was being offered a terminal contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.898" offset="599582">We reject the argument that the date should be the last date of employment under the terminal contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.128" offset="632496">We also reject the argument that at least it should have been no earlier than when respondent's grievance eventually was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.562" offset="674292">Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.854" offset="691428">Mr. Justice Stewart joined by Justice Brennan, and Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.761" offset="723089">Justice Stevens also has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
