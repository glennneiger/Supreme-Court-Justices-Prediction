            <text syncTime="88.652" offset="500508">One of the criticisms most frequently leveled against the operation of the federal criminal justice system concerns the manner in which sentences are meted out to persons convicted of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.319" offset="551185">These criticisms focus on the nearly unbridled discretion that is currently afforded a single individual, the district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.924" offset="589638">As an almost inevitable result of this discretion, gross disparities may frequently occur in the sentences handed out to similarly situated offenders for comparable criminal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.748" offset="632896">These disparities adversely affect the public perception of the fairness of the administration of criminal justice and they also engender understandable bitterness on the part of those defendants who receive harsh sentences when they look at others similarly situated who have received much more lenient ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.101" offset="710323">There is, in sum, a widespread feeling that something should be done to deal with this problem of unequal sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.985" offset="749821">Now, one obvious means of accomplishing this goal is a system of appellate review of sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.045" offset="774062">In fact, the adoption of such a system is one of the principal reforms proposed in the pending Criminal Code revision.</text>

            <text syncTime="204.450" offset="963711">And when the district court went to sentence it would have the unfettered discretion to sentence within those guidelines.</text>

            <text syncTime="1157.826" offset="4777275">It's a fairly lengthy treatment of this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.326" offset="4787202">Now, we're dealing here with the constitutionality of an Act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.261" offset="4810921">And, of course, it's our position that the burden is on those who attack the statute to demonstrate how it offends the policies of the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.008" offset="4841954">It seems to me that there are three possible objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.460" offset="4855747">The first is that the appeal itself constitute an impermissible second jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.441" offset="4879675">The second is that the Double Jeopardy Clause vests the defendant with the right to have his sentence treated with the same kind of finality as an acquittal would be treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.922" offset="4921576">And the third is the argument that an increase of the sentence on appeal constitutes a form of multiple punishment that's prohibited by Double Jeopardy concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.698" offset="4960759">Of course, we believe that none of these objections to Government sentence appeals is well-founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.633" offset="4984478">The first objection relates, I think, to the notion that the defendant should be spared the expense and anxiety and uncertainty of a proceeding that may result in an increase of his sentence, a second proceeding after the original sentencing proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.689" offset="5048635">Of course, as I have mentioned, in this case at least the second proceeding is not at all like that but it is on appeal argued by lawyers which the defendant does not even attend and which is limited to a review of the record made in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.433" offset="5111643">The second difficulty with this argument that the appeal itself is something which a defendant has protection from by the Double Jeopardy Clause is that it's well settled by the decisions of this Court as Wilson and Scott that the Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't protect against appeals as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.286" offset="5191055">In both Wilson and Scott the defendant had won a dismissal of the charges which would have made him a free man, and in each case the appeal threatened to jeopardize that and cause the reinstatement of a conviction or possibly even a second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.496" offset="5263884">The appeal entailed, it seems to me, precisely the same degree of ordeal and anxiety and expense as the appeal that would be entailed in this case, and yet the Double Jeopardy Clause was not offended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.787" offset="5325115">What is offended by an appeal, if anything, is the relief that the Government requests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.675" offset="5352596">That is, let's say, a new trial following an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.002" offset="5369941">Of course, if the Government is requesting relief that it is not entitled to have, then there would be no case or controversy before the appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.012" offset="5413932">But it is the relief itself and not the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.120" offset="5422395">The appeal is not a second jeopardy that the Constitution bars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.103" offset="5438382">Now, before I talk about the finality question as to whether a sentence is like an acquittal, let me briefly turn to the question of multiple punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1436.249" offset="5890927">Now, the proposition that allowing a Government appeal of a sentence which may increase a sentence constitutes multiple punishment is one that I have thought about in preparing my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.322" offset="5947247">And I have to admit that I simply don't understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.165" offset="5962607">The Government appeal in this case raises the question of the proper single punishment for respondent's offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.145" offset="5994477">The issue is not at all like the issue in cases like Whalen or Jeffers where the defendant received two sentences and the claim was that there was only one offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.563" offset="6040139">It's not at all like the seminal case of Ex parte Lange where the defendant received two sentences when only one was permitted by the statute, and in addition the problem that was involved in the companion case in North Carolina against Pearce, he received one five-day sentence and one one-year sentence, although the statute only allowed one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.430" offset="6119656">Now, there is, of course, the dictum in the United States against Benz, and I am not sure how to explain that except to say that the dictum is clearly based on Ex parte Lange; it contains no independent explanation of the source of its conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.405" offset="6199590">We have no difficulty with the conclusion that there is a multiple punishment problem in Ex parte Lange.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.059" offset="6226131">And, of course, neither Benz nor Ex parte Lange dealt with the question of Government appeals of sentences, but they both dealt with the question of the trial court calling the defendant back and changing the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.257" offset="6282973">Now, there might be a problem with the trial court having imposed the sentence and a few weeks later saying, I've changed my mind, I'm calling you back, but that is not the issue that we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.879" offset="6325396">And another peculiarity of the Benz issue is that it apparently applies only if the defendant has begun serving his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.032" offset="6354026">But if the defendant is on bail, apparently under this rule his sentence can be increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.794" offset="6389135">Now, that doesn't make very much sense to me, and particularly in light of the requirement that he be given credit for time served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.103" offset="6422363">And of course, on the Government's appeal, any sentence that's imposed by the Court of Appeals would have to under Simpson against Rice give credit for the time served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.959" offset="6457785">It doesn't make any sense to say that it turns on whether or not the defendant has begun serving his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.972" offset="6489758">I think that matter was a judge-made nonconstitutional rule dealing with the power of the district court to call somebody back for resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.281" offset="6531032">And of course Congress would have the power to overrule any such principle as long as it's not of constitutional dimensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.199" offset="6566767">Now then, we have the third and what to my mind is probably the only substantial argument that can be made in support of the decision of the Court of Appeals and that's the contention that the imposition of a sentence constitutes in effect an implied acquittal of any higher sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.208" offset="6638761">Therefore the defendant's interest in the finality of that sentence would be comparable to his interest in an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.362" offset="6663421">I think the best statement of this position is Justice Harlan's dissent in North Carolina against Pearce on this point, but I note that the Court did not accept that position and I further note that the position would not necessarily apply to Government appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.055" offset="6750147">There was nothing wrong with the first sentence in North Carolina against Pearce and therefore an argument could have been made and was made by Justices Harlan and Douglas that there was no adequate justification for depriving the defendant of what he had acquired at the first trial, which was a ceiling on his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.549" offset="6824126">Now here we are talking about a case in which it's the Government's contention that there's something legally wrong with the sentence that was initially imposed and that the Government should be entitled to correct it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.887" offset="6865504">The Court of Appeals' contrary decision rests on a mistaken impression, as I've said before, about the relationship of the Double Jeopardy Clause to the defendant's finality interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.539" offset="6912106">Those finality interests are not generally protected against the Government appeal but are protected only where the relief that the Government seeks is to set aside an acquittal and have a retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.346" offset="6963306">This point can be made clear by comparing Pearce with Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.610" offset="6988384">In Green there was an implied acquittal of a greater offense and the prosecution was barred from retrying the defendant for that offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.651" offset="7040524">In Pearce there was arguably an implied acquittal of a greater sentence and the prosecution was not barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.774" offset="7061004">Similarly, in Bozza against the United States, the Court held that the correction of an illegal sentence to increase it to minimum legal requirements was permissible under the Double Jeopardy Clause, but an illegal dismissal or acquittal entered by the judge in Fong Foo before the Government had barely begun the presentation of its evidence was held not reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.344" offset="7151283">Now, what this suggests is that there is for Double Jeopardy purposes a recognized and substantial difference between the finality interest that a defendant has in an acquittal and the finality interest that a defendant has in his sentence, just as there are differences for Due Process purposes between the kinds of procedures that must be afforded to a defendant at trial and to a defendant in connection with sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.536" offset="7252116">I think I should reserve the balance of my time.</text>
