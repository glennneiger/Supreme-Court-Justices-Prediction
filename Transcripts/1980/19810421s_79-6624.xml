            <text syncTime="7.977" offset="123948">This seems to be the Ninth Circuit's day, both the cases I have are here on certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.370" offset="173477">In Rosales-Lopez against United States, the petitioner is of Mexican descent.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.512" offset="210048">He was tried and convicted by a jury of participating in an illegal plan to bring Mexican aliens into the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.920" offset="259681">In the course of selecting the jury he requested the trial judge to make specific inquiry of the prospective jurors as to the possibility of racial or ethnic prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.929" offset="319762">A request was refused and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed holding that in the circumstances of the case no further inquiry was needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.969" offset="363857">We granted certiorari because the Court of Appeals and the lower federal courts differ widely as to when and under what circumstances specific inquiry as to this kind of prejudice need be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.354" offset="429477">We affirmed the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.494" offset="449957">I have filed an opinion to this effect in which Justices Stewart, Blackmun, and Powell, joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.503" offset="486006">Mr. Justice Rehnquist reaches the same result by a different course, he has filed an opinion in which the Chief Justice joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.114" offset="520487">Mr. Justice Stevens dissents and has filed an opinion in which Justices Brennan and Marshall joined.</text>
