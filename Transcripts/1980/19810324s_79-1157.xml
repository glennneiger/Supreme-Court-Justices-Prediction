            <text syncTime="9.593" offset="130430">This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.609" offset="158433">The Federal Tax Injunction Act of 1937 provides that the district courts shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection that any tax under state law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.852" offset="255400">Under an Illinois statute, real property owners who contest their property taxes are required first to exhaust their available administrative remedies and if unsuccessful, then afforded a legal remedy requiring the payment of the tax under protest and a subsequent state court challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.741" offset="358949">The customary delay from time of payment until receipt of refund upon successful protest is two years and the refund is not accompanied by a payment of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.185" offset="420807">The appellee in this case brought an action in Federal District Court to challenge the constitutionality of a tax assessment against her property and to seek injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.692" offset="470753">The District Court dismissed the suit on the ground that federal court jurisdiction was barred by the Federal Tax Injunction Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.401" offset="509623">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the dismissal holding that Illinois procedure of no interest refunds after two years was not a plain, speedy and efficient remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.821" offset="571272">For reason stated in the opinion filed with the clerk today, we disagree with the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.866" offset="603455">We hold that the Illinois refund procedure is a plain, speedy and efficient remedy within the meaning of those terms as used in the Tax Injunction Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.525" offset="650162">The District Court therefore correctly held that federal court jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief was barred by that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.316" offset="685271">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.356" offset="701466">Justice Blackmun joining the Court's opinion has also filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.462" offset="725917">Justice Stevens dissents and joined by Justices Stewart, Marshall and Powell has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
