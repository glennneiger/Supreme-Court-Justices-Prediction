            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="136949">We will hear arguments next in Federal Trade Commission v. Standard Oil Company of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.420" offset="170595">Mr. Solicitor General, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="97.228" offset="525860">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="100.097" offset="537249">The Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 provides in part that unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce are declared unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.006" offset="588972">And it further provides that whenever the Commission shall have reason to believe that any corporation is using any unfair method of competition and if it shall appear to the Commission that a proceeding in respect thereof to be in the interest of the public, it shall issue and serve on the respondent a complaint, which requires an answer, administer the proceedings to establish the proof of the allegations set out therein, and then the issuance, in case the allegations are established, of a cease and desist order which, unless overturned by a court on review or unless the period for review, which is 60 days, has expired, then becomes enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.022" offset="792936">This case presents important questions of administrative law and it requires the Court to answer a question that might be stated as follows: This case requires the Court to decide whether during the pendency of an administrative proceeding a district court that concededly cannot review the sufficiency of what is alleged in the agency complaint to constitute its reason to believe that certain firms have violated the law, can nevertheless determine whether the agency in fact made the reason to believe determination that caused it to file the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.135" offset="969419">The case arises out of the following factual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.039" offset="989063">The Federal Trade Commission in 1971 authorized an investigation to determine whether the structure of the petroleum industry caused it, or contributed to its engaging in unfair trade practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.202" offset="1069729">The investigation was concerned with competition, principally at the refining end of the petroleum industry, and had very little to do with the crude oil or importation end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.510" offset="1126885">The method in which the staff conducted the investigation consisted essentially of seeking information from independent operators and not directly from the principal vertically integrated corporations by calling in their officers or by subpoenaing their records.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.493" offset="1226882">It also consisted of seeking information from several governmental agencies that had the responsibility of collecting data about the petroleum industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.551" offset="1275052">This began in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.687" offset="1287695">In 1973 when the nation first experienced an acute fuel shortage, Senator Henry Jackson sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission Chairman requesting that within 30 days the Commission write a report on the relationship between the structure of the petroleum industry and the shortage of petroleum products that was afflicting the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.504" offset="1398872">That was May, 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.872" offset="1408381">On July 6, 1973, the Federal Trade Commission submitted to Senator Jackson a commission report entitled,</text>
            <text syncTime="328.330" offset="1450177">"Preliminary Federal Trade Commission Staff Report on its Investigation of the Petroleum Industry. "</text>
            <text syncTime="334.751" offset="1475881">And it indicated that this report had not yet been evaluated by the Commission, nor did the findings and conclusions necessarily reflect those of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.493" offset="1530843">It also asked that the report not be given undue publicity because it might jeopardize subsequent prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.766" offset="1567937">On July 13, seven days later, Senator Jackson released the preliminary report for publication as a committee report.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.824" offset="1616211">On July 18, then, the Commission, having on the previous July 17 issued a report stating that it intended to file a complaint, caused its complaint to be filed naming the eight petroleum companies that were respondents before the Commission and are respondents here, charging that they were violating Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, that it had reason to believe that that fact existed, and that it was in the public interest to proceed to a hearing on the allegations that the complaint set forth, describing the acts and practices claimed to be in violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.020" offset="1796978">Standard Oil of California, one of the eight named petroleum companies, moved the Commission to dismiss its complaint on the grounds that the Commission did not have reason to believe that this respondent had violated the law at the time it issued the complaint, and that the proceeding was not in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.735" offset="1895826">The Commission denied these motions by order of February 12, 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.741" offset="1923829">Respondent then sought reconsideration of this order and on June 4, 1974, the Commission denied the motion for rehearing and reiterated its previous determination that the adequacy of the Commission's "reason to believe" that a violation of the law had occurred, and its belief that a proceeding would be in the public interest, was not litigable.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.391" offset="2034484">The Commission staff then proceeded with discovery to prepare to prove the allegations set forth in the administrative complaint and Standard Oil of California and the other seven respondent petroleum companies vigorously resisted its efforts for discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.055" offset="2113165">Eleven months later, on May 1, 1975, Standard Oil of California filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California for declaratory relief, contending that the Federal Trade Commission did not have reason to believe that a violation of law had occurred at the time it filed its complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="518.687" offset="2211594">Are you going at some point to mention the proceeding in Indiana?</text>

            <text syncTime="528.293" offset="2250046">The proceeding in Indiana, Mr. Chief Justice, was a similar proceeding brought by Standard Oil of Indiana, another one of the eight respondents, also asserting that the Commission did not have reason to believe that Section 5 of the Act had been violated at the time it filed its petition, its administrative complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.426" offset="2346595">That matter was decided as far as its result is concerned favorably to the Commission, because the District Court, although looking into the matter, concluded that the Commission had reason to believe and therefore the Commission was successful at the district court level.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.924" offset="2432590">An appeal was noticed in that and dismissed, I believe, but there is no Court of Appeals decision pending with reference to that, and as far as I am aware that matter rests.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="586.665" offset="2483581">What would you say is the impact of that holding on this case, if any?</text>

            <label>Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="592.485" offset="2506882">Well, I think... I think it has no precedential value for this purpose, it just shows that another district court thought that it could at that stage of the administrative proceeding look into the adequacy of the reason to believe standard, or look into whether the Commission did in fact make the reason to believe determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.071" offset="2625165">But it's not a precedent for us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.373" offset="2638435">As a matter of fact, even more recently, in a case called Boise-Cascade, that was decided last May, the... I believe... the District Court for the District of Delaware decided that a district court could not look into the sufficiency of a reason to believe determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.190" offset="2741671">And if the Indiana case is a precedent against the Commission, certainly the Boise-Cascade case is a precedent for the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.415" offset="2786601">But we think that neither is even instructive to this Court, except for the favorable language that we find in the Boise-Cascade case, which effectively follows the language of the dissenting opinion in the matter in the Northern District of California, where Standard Oil of California filed the complaint to which I just made reference.</text>

            <text syncTime="715.199" offset="2997671">That is, could the Commission simply issue a complaint in the language of the statute and serve it on the respondent and the respondent simply file a general denial and then go to discovery?</text>

            <text syncTime="732.411" offset="3066529">I think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.428" offset="3074575">I think the Commission must have reason to believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.296" offset="3090040">I don't think it could do it capriciously, and if the Justice's inquiry looks to that point, I would say, it cannot do it capriciously.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.938" offset="3136642">It must have reason to believe, but it's our contention that what constitutes reason to believe as the argument will develop is a matter that is not reviewable by the Court, that if it's agency action it is action committed to the discretion of the agency and therefore is not reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.534" offset="3223055">We would liken it to prosecutorial discretion to initiate a prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.005" offset="3248969">Responsibly, a prosecutor would not initiate a prosecution unless he had reason to believe that there was some basis for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.579" offset="3295258">But we submit that ordinarily a court will not inquire into the reason why a prosecutor decided to initiate a fraud proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="800.370" offset="3338412">Wouldn't one go further than that in the court system and say that if a prosecutor initiates a prosecution a defendant can't come in and have it dismissed on the grounds that the prosecutor had no reason to believe that the evidence would prove the case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="821.784" stopTime="1017.377">
            <label>Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="821.784" offset="3423989">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.367" offset="3426392">He cannot do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.402" offset="3430467">We quite agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.586" offset="3435274">And we contend that he cannot do it here either.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.038" offset="3445096">The District Court for the Northern District of California upon entertaining this complaint that asked for a declaratory judgment and other relief proceeded essentially to determine, first, that the sufficiency of the reason to believe, the sufficiency of the facts that gave the Commission reason to believe as it recited was committed to agency discretion and was not reviewable for the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.079" offset="3601204">And neither side disagrees with that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.115" offset="3617400">He then dismissed the action brought before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.935" offset="3636626">The Court of Appeals, however, for the 9th Circuit, two members of a three-judge panel agreed first with the determination of the district court, agreeing that the... well, I'm ahead of myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.880" offset="3704440">I'll take it step by step if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.915" offset="3712590">First, it determined that it was agency action to file the complaint, which is something with which we disagree and I'll talk about it in a few moments.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.490" offset="3766820">Second, it determined that whether there was reason to believe that the Act had been violated was agency action committed to the discretion of the agency, and therefore under the Administrative Procedures Act could not be reviewed by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.421" offset="3854591">However... and we think it's a little extraordinary... the Court of Appeals went on to decide that judicial review is available with respect to whether the Commission did in fact make a reason to believe determination, and that there was law to apply, as this court used this phrase, in Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, and it vacated the judgment of dismissal and remanded the matter to the district judge with instructions to find out, did the Commission in fact make a reason to believe determination, which determination is unreviewable, as it decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.300" offset="4042046">That's the status in which this matter confronts the Court this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.656" offset="4067542">One judge dissented on the ground that the Commission's action initiating the administrative proceeding is in essence an exercise of prosecutorial discretion and as such is exempted from judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.267" offset="4141938">He also said that to permit an inquiry into whether the determination was in fact made would require an impermissible probing into the mental processes of the Commission and that it was something in which the Court should not engage.</text>

            <text syncTime="1038.809" offset="4292090">The complaint purports to be issued pursuant to the authorization of the Commission, the complaint recites that a reason to believe determination was made, the complaint is attested to by the Secretary of the Commission and is in every respect in proper form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.073" offset="4381220">Yet, the Court of Appeals did what we regard as an extraordinary thing and suggests that the complaint that was filed before the district court is sufficient to raise that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.816" offset="4440152">And I think it's very much like questioning an indictment handed down by a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.069" offset="4465125">It's in proper form, it's signed by the foreman of the grand jury, recites that a majority of the grand jurors agree to the allegations set forth in the indictment, and then the defendant is permitted, before any proof is introduced, to say, I don't think they really agreed to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.817" offset="4544120">And the court would investigate to see whether or not that happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="1342.106" offset="5505321">Arguendo, Mr. Chief Justice, I can make that concession, and I think this happens sometimes in the criminal area where a prosecution takes place because the public is insistent upon the solving of some crime that vexes it, and sometimes perhaps in those instances a grand jury may return an indictment with unseemly haste.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.542" offset="5627052">The question, of course, becomes whether they actually did it, and the proof of the sufficiency of it comes in its capacity to sustain it later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.166" offset="5673550">And if the Commission in this case cannot sustain these allegations, of course there will be no cease and desist order, which is the sanction that the Commission would impose if its staff in presenting evidence could establish these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.866" offset="5760381">And that's a higher standard than reason to believe, which is a very vague standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.853" offset="5784309">Also, I would like to comment too, further stimulated by the Chief Justice's question, that the fact that there was a political inquiry doesn't of itself vitiate the proceeding or suggest that there's not reason to believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.195" offset="5853690">The Congress has responsibility for the same matters that the Federal Trade Commission has, to see that there are not anticompetitive activities in the petroleum market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.039" offset="5905099">And for it to make an inquiry of an agency that was created with the primary function to oversee these matters seems to me the most responsible kind of legislative action that could take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.763" offset="5955986">And nowhere does Standard Oil of California assert that Senator Jackson required them to file an action, or even suggested that they file an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.773" offset="6015963">His was an inquiry about their investigation, which commenced in 1971 and it proceeded for 17 months before the fuel crisis stimulated him in his capacity as Chairman of the Permanent Investigations Subcommittee of the Senate, to make this inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.138" offset="6109481">Our argument, essentially, is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.856" offset="6128289">First, we suggest that the issuance of an administrative complaint is not agency action within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1758.110" offset="7169321">The cases present entirely disparate issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.962" offset="7184786">The only party to this case is the Standard Oil Company of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.330" offset="7202236">In the Indiana case seven of the eight respondents in Docket 8934 are the plaintiffs in that suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.620" offset="7231388">The issue in the Indiana case goes to a denial of due process to respondents because of a denial of discovery in Docket 8934 by the administrative law judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.462" offset="7294709">The orders of the judge which prompted the Indiana case were orders which denied respondents any discovery until after complaint counsel had completed their discovery and had perhaps further defined the issues in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.026" offset="7369001">The suit before Judge McNagny contended that such a denial of discovery per se was a denial of due process in the circumstances of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.250" offset="7417902">Judge McNagny agreed with that and he voided it, the two orders in question, of the administrative law judge, and directed that the administrative law judge should reconsider discovery applications by the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.093" offset="7481223">I think from that, Mr. Chief Justice, that you'll understand that the issue there is entirely disparate from the issue presented here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.116" offset="7513406">It was made explicitly clear in the pleadings in the Indiana case that no challenge was being made to the reason to believe of the Commission at the time it issued the complaint in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.339" offset="7558232">That was explicitly clear in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.673" offset="7567636">That issue, the absence of reason to believe that Standard of California had violated Section 5 before the complaint issued is the issue that is presented in this case exclusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.116" offset="7625315">The issue before the Court is whether the allegations in Standard's complaint state a claim for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.657" offset="7667529">There is no evidentiary record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.193" offset="7681635">The 9th Circuit held that the allegations of Standard's complaint and the reasonable inferences therefrom state a claim for relief on account of conduct of the Commission which is in violation of constitutional and statutory requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.802" offset="7744120">Standard's claim is that the Commission charged Standard with a federal offense without reason to believe that Standard had violated the law, that is, without any basis to relate conduct to Standard in the relevant geographic area to a violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.048" offset="7833040">The Commission's position in the case is that whether it had reason to believe that Standard had violated Section 5 is not subject to review in any Court at any time, and that the basis for its action, however invidious and unrelated to statutory requirement, may never be examined by a Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.033" offset="7933037">That Commission assertion of unreviewable prerogative cannot be squared with due process safeguards or the rule of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3379.948" offset="13656675">Standard brought its suit in District Court because it has no other remedy for the Commission wrongdoing in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.387" offset="13690425">It is essential in this connection to bear in mind that the Commission has a prosecutorial function as well as an adjudicative role.</text>

            <text syncTime="3426.679" offset="13843607">The unlawful Commission conduct here in issue is not a procedural ruling or other action by the Commission in its adjudicative role in the course of Docket 8934.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.586" offset="13895225">It is unlawful conduct by the Commission in its prosecutorial function, antecedent to commencement of Docket 8934.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.692" offset="13931692">There's a crucial distinction.</text>
