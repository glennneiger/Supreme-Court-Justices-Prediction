            <text syncTime="15.775" offset="155082">In the first of these cases, the Federal Trade Commission against Standard Oil of California, the case is here from the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.330" offset="201371">It presents an administrative law question of some importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.951" offset="219866">In 1973, the Federal Trade Commission issued a complaint against eight oil companies including the respondent, the Standard Oil of California, charging violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.628" offset="282560">Respondent is sued in the Federal District Court alleging that the Commission had issued its complaint without having reason to believe that violations had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.792" offset="335223">The season to believe a statutory term is a prerequisite to the Commission's authority to issue complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.509" offset="374093">The District Court dismissed respondent's complaint but the Court of Appeals disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.895" offset="403559">It held that the District Court should have inquired whether in fact a sufficient investigation had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.211" offset="440862">In our view, the Commission's issuance of its complaint is not final agency action under Section 10 (c) of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.594" offset="490390">The mere issuance is not a definitive ruling and it had no legal or practical effect on respondent other than the expense and disruption that attends any major litigation in the absence of final agency action, the issuance of the complaint is not judicially reviewable before administrative adjudication is concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.197" offset="600836">We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.030" offset="616091">Mr. Justice Stevens, while concurring into judgment has filed a separate opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.926" offset="659768">In the second of these cases -- oh, I should have announced that Mr. Justice Stewart took no part in the consideration or decision of the case that I have just announced.</text>
