            <text syncTime="38.791" offset="293458">This petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida brings an ex post facto question before the Court, challenging the application to this petitioner of a Florida statute reducing the statutory gain time formula available to those incarcerated in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.872" offset="381856">Although not a class action it has potential consequences to as many as 16,000 persons sentenced in Florida prior to January 1, 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.898" offset="437967">A statement of the rather brief facts delineates the issue which is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.568" offset="468583">In 1976 Weaver, following a negotiated plea bargain, was sentenced to 15 years in the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.676" offset="505050">Florida law at that time prescribed a gain time formula which was mandated upon good conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.266" offset="547368">We use "gain time" as an expression in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.233" offset="559280">Some states: "good time".</text>
            <text syncTime="106.785" offset="565445">In common vernacular, time off for good behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.587" offset="584671">The State concedes with great candor that all one needed to do under the Florida statute, and I quote, was "stay out of trouble".</text>

            <text syncTime="123.545" offset="632527">And that was by statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_c_macdonald_jr" startTime="125.664" stopTime="279.164">

            <text syncTime="126.381" offset="643917">The so called new law, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, they added the phrase, "at beginning of each month".</text>
            <text syncTime="135.220" offset="679234">But if you read both statutes, you will see in Subsection 1(c) of the so called old law, or first statute, that it is added each month.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.994" offset="722284">As a matter of administrative convenience alone, when the prisoner is introduced to the system, a so called tentative expiration date is calculated on the assumption that he would earn all of the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.254" offset="783411">This is done under both statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.622" offset="792815">In 1978 Florida reduced the formula, the former formula which was set out in brief as the so called 5-10-15, reduced to 3-6-9, a 40 percent reduction applied from January 1, 1979, forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.601" offset="864704">The effect of this upon my client is that if he had earned all of the time under the old statute he would have been required to serve only 8-1/2 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.093" offset="918725">Under the new statute, 11 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.045" offset="930532">Thus the burden of the two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.897" offset="941922">Upon petition by several pro se petitioners acting separately to the Supreme Court of Florida, the ruling was had which is now the subject of the petition before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.889" offset="993853">Acting pro se, without oral argument, and I must say, in candor, without discussion of the controlling authorities enunciated by this Court in the past, the Supreme Court of Florida held in effect that this Act of the Florida Legislature was an act of legislative grace which of course is a monumental begging of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.789" offset="1097507">The establishment of the system in the first instance is the act of grace.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.293" offset="1127495">But the amendment, alteration, and change is not an act of grace, and that was the issue not discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.399" offset="1159887">That doctrine, of course, has been discredited in virtually every state in which this issue has arisen, and in comparable situations it has been discredited, we feel, by the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.641" offset="1216939">Once the state adopts an early release procedure, be it parole or otherwise, it may not change it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1098.470" offset="4532191">And I believe under the decided precedents... in fact, I would say that would be governed almost completely by Lindsey v. Washington, which you distinguished in your opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.360" offset="4579734">Remembering also that in that case Dobbert made what I would regard as virtually a sophistry that he wasn't governed by either statute because there wasn't a valid capital offense statute in effect in Florida at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.972" offset="4658206">It is argued by the State that there is no liberty interest in unearned gain time, and therefore the ex post facto clause is not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.230" offset="4707211">In other words, if we do not reach procedural due process in the cause, then we need not concern ourselves with the ex post facto clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1154.889" offset="4757889">We mention such cases as Greenfield and Wolff v. McDonnell in our brief to point out that the Court has held in the past that gain time once acquired is a liberty interest, and once you lose earned gain time for disciplinary reasons, it must be done with certain minimal procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.005" offset="4854333">My point in citing those cases is not to suggest this is a Fourteenth Amendment case at all, but merely to point out that by definition the right to acquire a liberty interest necessarily affects liberty in the first instance, thus affects punishment, and thus is within those cases which we cite under the ex post facto clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1425.115" offset="5838836">As I understand the issue urged upon this Court, it is that the application of Florida's new gain time statute in the computation of gain time makes the statute an ex post facto law as applied to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.611" offset="5924831">This same issue was rejected by the Florida Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.115" offset="5950849">As I understand it, the basis for the ex post facto claim is that Section 944.275 permits the accumulation of a lesser amount of gain time than did the old statute, Section 944.27.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.148" offset="6046979">The Respondent contends that Florida's new gain time statute is not ex post facto, because it does not apply a new punitive measure to a crime already consummated to the detriment or material disadvantage of the wrongdoer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.594" offset="6136736">And I submit to the Court that this is a necessary ingredient in order to support an ex post facto claim, and this Court so held, I believe, in Dobbert v. Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.537" offset="6204446">The statute is remedial and constitutes a procedural change in the statutory mechanism designed for the purpose of granting gain time to deserving prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.481" offset="6268289">The statute deprives petitioner of nothing that he has already earned, and at this point let me urge upon the Court that I believe it should be pointed out that under this Court's holding in Beazell v. Ohio, that the prohibition against ex post facto laws does not limit the legislative control of remedies and modes of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.570" offset="6400573">I think this Court's decision in Hopt v. Utah ably pinpoints the position of the respondent here, and I quote very briefly.</text>

            <text syncTime="3114.239" offset="12595251">And let me finally say that if that is the law of Florida, then Florida can change all of its sentences, because Your Honors can look at the Florida statutes and see that it merely provides that murder is a certain type of felony, burglary is a certain type of felony, and all of the punishments are somewhere else.</text>
