            <text syncTime="17.765" offset="163146">That Court held that respondent, a shipper, could to pursue a state damage action against petitioner, a regulated rail carrier, for failure to provide adequate service.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.899" offset="219675">The question before us is whether the state damage action is preempted by the provisions of Interstate Commerce Act even the Interstate Commerce Commission jurisdiction or decisions by regulated carriers to suspend service.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.679" offset="290728">For reasons set forth in an opinion filed this morning with the clerk, we hold that when, as here, the Commission has already upheld the carrier decision to abandon the line in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.848" offset="343391">No state actions or damages can lie against the carrier.</text>
