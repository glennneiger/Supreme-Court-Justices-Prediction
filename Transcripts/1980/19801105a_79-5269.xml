            <text syncTime="13.511" offset="204593">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.213" offset="215356">This case is here on certiorari to the Arizona Supreme Court which affirmed a conviction of Petitioner Edwards which included the use of incriminating testimony given by him to police officers at an interrogation just before he was to be given appointive counsel at his first court appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.767" offset="289543">The offenses arise from a robbery of a bar in Tucson, Arizona, in October of 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.937" offset="326219">The case went unsolved for a considerable period of time but ultimately by gaining confessions from two accomplices the police solved the case sometime before January 19, 1976, about 15 months after the offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.322" offset="387764">At that point the police obtained a complaint from a magistrate to determine probable cause to believe that an offense had been committed, who issued an arrest warrant for Robert Edwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.207" offset="451398">The police then went to a slum area of Tucson and arrested Edwards, who then was young and indigent, and took him to the Tucson Police Department.</text>

            <text syncTime="91.403" offset="516182">He was 24 at the time of the trial, which was more than a year later.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.824" offset="529765">At the Police Department he was read his Miranda rights, which he said he understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.259" offset="551604">He gave a recorded statement at the Tucson Police Department, when interrogated by a police detective named Bunting.</text>

            <text syncTime="131.246" offset="675529">But in their brief they very expressly, in that portion of the argument, agreed that he had been formally charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.634" offset="705099">As a matter of fact they agreed in the statement their question presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.290" offset="715653">After the tape recording of the statement, Edwards and Detective Bunting had an exchange back and forth about whether he would make a further statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.409" offset="772182">He apparently tried to convince the police that they should talk with him about some kind of a deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.813" offset="801752">The police said that they would give him a chance to tell his side of the story but they would not entertain any kind of deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.824" offset="829860">Ultimately, Edwards was taken for holding overnight at the Pima County jail after he told Detective Bunting in words to the effect: I'm not going to make a statement now, I'm not going to make a deal now, I'm going to wait until I get my attorney.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael J. Meehan</label>
            <text syncTime="233.347" offset="1083875">My position is that in terms of application of Miranda, Mr. Chief Justice, that unless truly the accused himself institutes a change of mind, that there should be no reinterrogation until counsel has a chance to confer with the accused who has asked for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.870" offset="1169974">This Court made very clear, I think, in Miranda, that that situation, where an accused asks for a lawyer, should be treated differently from the situation where the accused simply listens to the rights and then goes ahead and speaks or even listens to the rights being read to him and decides to remain silent, which indicates that he is feeling capable of making his own decisions about whether to deal with the interrogating officers or not to deal with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.891" offset="1278121">It was said in Miranda and this Court confirmed in a majority and concurring opinions in Mosley, and in Innis, and in Fare v. Michael C., that Miranda meant what it said; that unless... at least as far as the police reinterrogation... once the accused has been read his Miranda rights and says he'd like to have a lawyer, that there shall be no reinterrogation until a lawyer is provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.832" offset="1393896">This case demonstrates, I think, why that often is no great burden, because there was no reason that the interrogation couldn't have been carried out after 1:30 on the 20th of January.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.390" offset="1444051">Instead it was carried out on the morning of 20 January, hours before Edwards would be making his first appearance and at a time when the police were aware that Edwards as an indigent would be appointed counsel that afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.445" offset="1508312">They knew that he was about to get a lawyer.</text>

            <label>Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="341.366" offset="1515940">Well, it could be, Mr. Meehan, that if a crime occurs at 11 o'clock at night, that there aren't many lawyers willing to get out of bed at that hour of night to provide the necessary support for a defendant, that might be during the daytime.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Michael J. Meehan</label>
            <text syncTime="363.576" offset="1604861">That's true, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.498" offset="1612489">And, indeed, in Miranda, what was said was, we're not holding that the police have to have a lawyer in every precinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.605" offset="1636939">But I'd like to emphasize two things about this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.369" offset="1648015">One, the case was solved.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.414" offset="1656165">They were not looking for additional offenders, they were not further investigating the case, they were not looking for the fruits or the instrumentalities of the crime such as may have been a justification in Innis had that been held to have been an interrogation, they were not trying to locate the body as was the case in Brewer v. Williams, there was no urgency.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.795" offset="1753654">And even under Miranda it seems to me, once the accused says, I would like a lawyer, he's indicating that he feels that he needs to have that help, he needs to have somebody with him; he's acknowledging that the inherent coercive atmosphere, custodial interrogation, which is the focus of the Miranda guarantee, and the reason for the warnings and affording the right to counsel is affecting him.</text>

            <text syncTime="453.290" offset="1963679">There was also obtained, and before this interrogation of Edwards, a tape-recorded confession of another accomplice named Soto.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.317" offset="2003803">As a matter of fact that tape recorded confession had been played, several minutes of it, at least, for Edwards on the morning of his interrogation, which prompted the admissions that are the subject of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="476.577" offset="2056779">Would you consider it a solution of the case if the police got incriminating statements from three potential suspects to whom they had not read their Miranda rights, and all of their declarations were excluded and the jury returned verdicts of acquittal?</text>

            <text syncTime="498.897" offset="2146118">I think I would treat it as having been solved by virtue of what the police felt at the time that they undertook the interrogation, and I think, number one, it would be somewhat unrealistic to have a set of facts in which there were three different statements without Miranda rights having been read to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.999" offset="2210484">But secondly, it seems to me the focus has to be at the time of the interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.716" offset="2225426">What was the motive of the police in undertaking this interrogation?</text>
            <text syncTime="522.512" offset="2240577">At that time the offense was old, they were not, you know, on the trail of additional accomplices.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.634" offset="2273073">They felt, as the State said in its opener, its responsor brief, they felt they had enough evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.976" offset="2302435">That's exactly what the State said in its brief, and they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.413" offset="2312152">And they presented it to a magistrate, and a magistrate then has the right and the obligation to weigh that evidence, to cross-examine the complaining officer, to determine whether or not there's probable cause to believe that an offense was committed, and the defendant committed it, and if so to in effect file the complaint, which is to say, to approve the complaint and then to issue the arrest warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.091" offset="2398879">There are, of course, two issues presented in this case, one under Miranda and one under the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.601" offset="2464916">Because the State has recently chosen to argue that no formal prosecution had begun in this case, I would like to spend more time talking about the Sixth Amendment aspects of it than the Miranda aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.861" offset="2521968">As I said, in the courts below and in its briefs in this Court, except the supplemental brief, the State has agreed with the Petitioner that at the time of this interrogation formal prosecution had begun and the right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment as a critical stage had arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.148" offset="2615068">A week ago the State contended on the virtue of a Second Circuit case construing federal criminal rules of procedure that no formal prosecution had begun.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.096" offset="2662925">I think the State was correct in its first position.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.877" offset="2674001">In Arizona, under the criminal rules, prosecution may be commenced in two ways, either by indictment or by complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="1002.306" offset="4159741">The State agreed with us in their briefs before the Supreme Court as to the sequence of events, and they agreed with us here as to the sequence of events.</text>

            <text syncTime="1263.827" offset="5205788">He was told generally that he was an accused in a murder case on the 19th when he was interrogated by Sergeant Bunting at the Tucson Police Department.</text>

I'll talk with you, but I don't want anything tape recorded because I don't want it used against me in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.390" offset="5340058">It seems to me that the State must argue, and obviously does argue, that Edwards' Sixth Amendment right was waived, and the question then becomes whether in fact a waiver can occur of that right and whether it can be supported by the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.725" offset="5421455">Brewer v. Williams is the closest that this Court has come to finding what will support a waiver in a Sixth Amendment as opposed to a Miranda or a Fifth Amendment kind of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.798" offset="5473700">Brewer did not, however, reach what would be sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.953" offset="5490314">All other waivers of trial rights, rights like the right to counsel, which involved the factfinding process, the fairness of the trial, and the reliability of the trial, have always been required to be made in open court and approved and supervised by a trial judge, so far as I can tell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.538" offset="5576623">This Court has said in in the Schneckloth case that the high standard of waiver which I think applies in the Sixth Amendment kinds of cases requires a showing of knowledge, understanding, and voluntary relinquishment that can only, or at least is designed to be carried out in that kind of a setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.124" offset="5651019">I submit that in the case that's before the Court, there is no justification for finding a waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.213" offset="5699398">It's possible that in order to establish the very high standard that this Court has imposed by Johnson v. Zerbst and by Fare v. Michael C., and by at least in dictum Schneckloth, and Faretta v. California for waiver of right to counsel at a critical stage, that a waiver should be either conducted before a magistrate or a judge in open court so that the record can be made that should be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.703" offset="5801380">Or that it cannot be accepted unless counsel has had a chance to consult and advise the client, or at the very least, that it be an express waiver of a kind that would provide independent evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.368" offset="5863970">And I say, independent from the testimony of those who really have an interest in establishing a waiver, a videotape, an audio tape, or even a written waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.583" offset="5900854">I'm not suggesting that this Court needs to accept or reject any one of the three or that even any one of the three necessarily have to be exclusive, but it seems to me that the cases of this Court impose a very high standard of joined waiver and that in order to fulfill that some kind of quite reliable factfinding process needs to be undertaken before there can be a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.448" offset="6000329">In this case, what do we have that would establish a waiver?</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.415" offset="6020182">Number one, when the police went to the jail on the morning of the 20th to interrogate Edwards, he said he didn't want to talk to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.225" offset="6047454">He told the detention officer he didn't want to come out of "the hole", as he described it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.832" offset="6061873">Number two, after he was given his Miranda rights and was read a tape recording of another accomplice, he made the very conflicting statement, I'll tell you what you want to hear, but I don't want it recorded because I don't want it used against me in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.905" offset="6114118">The police said, big deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.279" offset="6123627">There are two of us here; we can testify to what you say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.045" offset="6134703">He didn't say, oh, okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.637" offset="6141076">He said, I don't want it used against me in court so I don't want it tape recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.197" offset="6159258">And finally, he did not say anything about giving up his right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.087" offset="6178902">He didn't say, well, I wanted a lawyer yesterday but today I feel more able to deal for myself and so I don't want one today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.006" offset="6202516">Under these facts, it seems to me there can be no waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1622.806" offset="6641792">This case involves two issues, admissibility of a confession after a request for an attorney, and the waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1647.187" offset="6739281">Now there is fairly considerable disagreement about this, but Sergeant Bunting, everyone agrees, advised him twice: once at the beginning of the interview and once on the tape.</text>
