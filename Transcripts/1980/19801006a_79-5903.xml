            <text syncTime="881.213" offset="3676713">But that isn't always true, that you bring parents in, and frequently you bring them in, and have the result that that will cause more trouble, if it's an abusive parent.</text>

            <text syncTime="899.324" offset="3749229">Now, on that case, this is the problem with the statute: instead of being able to respond to the very particularized questions you asked me, Mr. Chief Justice, this is a broad, it's an all inclusive statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.300" offset="3801056">It disregarded the concerns that this Court has stated, that in this area a statute that's drawn should be drawn very narrowly, and very carefully, and consider the interests of the minor.</text>

I say that with some degree of trepidation when I say, no, but I say it with the knowledge that when she is initially going to someone who the State of Utah has licensed as a physician, and said that, to this regard, you have to counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1360.402" offset="5593474">But I say that with the knowledge that you have, that at least a number of the members of this Court feel that there should be some counseling.</text>

            <text syncTime="1374.012" offset="5647913">And a physician is not in a position where he is going to simply go ahead and perform it without, that type of counseling without knowing that, if you want to call it this way, his license is at risk, his malpractice insurance is at risk, if he commits a malpractice or a violation of a licensing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.223" offset="5724818">And in fact, that same protection is insidiously, I feel, undermined in this case because it moves in and if a doctor is in a situation where the minor who comes in and they sit down, no counselor, no social workers at all, and the counseling takes place one to one and the doctor says, you should be aborted, your parents should not be notified, in my best medical judgment, but I can't do it because of this statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3272.324" offset="13241187">That was the point that I thought was significant in that it came before Danforth and before Bellotti I and of course long before Bellotti II.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.416" offset="13285595">It was passed in '74 and challenged in this case in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.570" offset="13314225">A particular emphasis that I would like to give, just in summary, to this case is that the State of Utah has chosen in this sensitive area to keep the State and its mechanisms, its agencies, and everyone else, far removed from the decision making process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.505" offset="13429895">It has seen this problem as being one to be handled within the family context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.093" offset="13456331">And that's why I see this case as an important case involving what the limits of family participation are, what the rights of the family as a unit are.</text>

            <text syncTime="3350.375" offset="13553402">The problem is that any of those adverse consequences come purely, if they come at all... which is not in the record... come as a matter of private action of parents.</text>

            <text syncTime="3436.264" offset="13896965">The statute adopted in '74 was declared unconstitutional by a three judge Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.266" offset="13916922">Appeal was taken to this Court and it was dismissed when this statute was adopted in '75.</text>

            <text syncTime="3449.972" offset="13951822">The Federal court found it very vague and abstained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.542" offset="13966032">That was appealed to the 10th Circuit who affirmed the abstention decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.161" offset="13980557">This case was filed in '77 as a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.063" offset="13992155">So there has been a series of challenges to this spread out over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.248" offset="14008873">Then I wanted to point out from the questions of Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Stevens where they were talking about the mature minor or emancipated minor, none of those exist in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.622" offset="14050356">This statute is, on its face... and Mr. Justice Stewart, you asked and I didn't fully respond about emancipation occurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.393" offset="14081494">Emancipation in terms of moving out of the house, no; in terms of marriage, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.882" offset="14107407">But Utah doesn't have the emancipated minor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3634.090" offset="14688266">Because after this Court enunciated that decision, I filed a motion with the Utah Supreme Court for an intermediate injunction enjoining the statute, and argued many of the points that we've covered today.</text>
