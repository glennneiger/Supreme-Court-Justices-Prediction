            <text syncTime="76.431" offset="465038">In my argument today I will address the petitioners, Mr. Robert Parratt and Mr. Francis Lugenbill, as the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.206" offset="504221">I will refer to Mr. Taylor as the plaintiff.</text>

            <text syncTime="92.610" offset="529821">As a bit of factual background, in April, 1975, the plaintiff was housed in a penal institution in the State of Nebraska of which Mr. Parratt was the warden and Mr. Lugenbill was the supervisor of the hobby counter, which is an internal organism which provides hobby goods for inmates at that institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.010" offset="639431">The plaintiff ordered hobby material while he was a prisoner; money was deducted from his inmate account to pay the vendor for those goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.199" offset="672136">Before the goods arrived the plaintiff violated the disciplinary rule and was placed in disciplinary segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.520" offset="697423">When the hobby materials arrived the plaintiff was still on disciplinary segregation and was not entitled to have them at that point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.959" offset="731173">The materials were signed into the institution by a Mr. Kosta and a Mr. Gero, as a part of their clerical duties at the hobby counter, and the material was held at the hobby counter for the plaintiff.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.597" offset="857710">I think if you look at the answers to the interrogatories filed by defendant Parratt and defendant Lugenbill, they indicate that those signatures were affixed as part of their clerical duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.187" offset="912149">I admit that this poses some problems at this point in time, particularly in view of the fact that this case was resolved against us on a motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.677" offset="950079">But, in our opinion, there does appear to be some question with regard to that particular aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.116" offset="983829">In June, 1975, the plaintiff was released from disciplinary segregation and requested that the hobby materials be provided him.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.257" offset="1028342">A search was made for them and they could not be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.643" offset="1041926">In October of 1975 the plaintiff filed his first complaint with the U.S. District Court and the District Court did not file the complaint and instructed him to return and seek a remedy with the Department of Correctional Services.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.318" offset="1096574">In November of '75 the plaintiff filed a second complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.686" offset="1110053">This complaint was filed but dismissed prior to issuance of summons on the grounds that it was frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.674" offset="1134086">In March, 1976, a third complaint was filed and summons was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.909" offset="1154984">In April, 1977, counsel was appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.030" offset="1167523">In June, 1978, the plaintiff filed his motion for summary judgment, and in October of '78 a judgment was granted the plaintiff against these defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="331.662" offset="1486007">Number three was to provide a remedy where an adequate state law was not in fact available to a plaintiff.</text>

            <text syncTime="1676.397" offset="6864933">But aside from that, I think that, I think the key is, Your Honor, is that they acted... there was an established institutional procedure which they violated, and I suspect that if there had been no institutional procedures and if they had simply left Mr. Taylor's property to the wind or whoever grabbed it when it came to the institution, that there would be no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.212" offset="6956153">But I'm just saying that I think the facts are different than as related by the Attorney General's office this morning, and they're considerably different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.199" offset="6980185">I think the Attorney General's represented... well, as I stated, I think that they can be broken into three different categories, the first being the institutional procedure that was in effect at all times pertinent hereto, and this was set forth in the stipulated facts of the grievance supervisor or officer prepared by the Attorney General's office, at his suggestion, at a hearing on a motion for default judgment in this particular case, filed on behalf of the respondent for their failure to answer interrogatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.719" offset="7106200">And the grievance procedure was, as stipulated to, that normal procedure when a package is received at the institution addressed to an inmate, at the central mail room, it is either that the package is delivered to the inmate's cell where he signs the package receipt, or the inmate is notified to pick the package up at the hobby center and to personally receipt for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.730" offset="7182269">And then it goes on to say that deviations from this practice are only made in exceptional circumstances, and there is no record of there being any exceptional circumstance in this case, which seems to me to be an entirely different case from that as represented to the Court this morning by the Attorney General's office.</text>

            <text syncTime="3454.974" offset="13979225">Our view is that the existence of that remedy or some similar remedy in fact provides the process due under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.281" offset="14028440">Therefore, if it is absent in any forum... it's against the plaintiff, although he may not need to allege it specifically under Gomez he certainly would have the burden of proving that as a part of his prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.606" offset="14081730">Second of all, with regard to the use or abuse of state power, it seems to me on this record the only use of state power here was the establishment of the bailment of that property when it came into the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.997" offset="14131363">And the loss of it, I don't think necessarily involves an abuse of process in any respect.</text>

            <text syncTime="3652.151" offset="14767914">And finally, I would like to say that with regard to the question of negligence and whether simple negligence itself forms a cause of action under 1983, that I think the interest shown by amicus on behalf of the petitioners here, along with petitioners themselves, indicates a strong desire for some guidance from this Court on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.368" offset="14864776">And I would ask the Court if possible to provide us some sense of where we stand on that question.</text>
