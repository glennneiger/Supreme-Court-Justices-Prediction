            <text syncTime="7.588" offset="122389">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.797" offset="151228">That Court affirmed an order by the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri refusing to disqualify the respondent who has an attorney from representing the plaintiffs in an ongoing civil suit against petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.759" offset="223117">The Eighth Circuit also held that in the future, such orders would not be appealable until after final judgment in the underlying litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.067" offset="268257">They've made a certiorari to resolve a conflict among the circuits of where the orders denying motion to disqualify counsel in civil cases are appealable and final decisions under 28 United States Code Section 1291.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.949" offset="339832">We held -- we hold here that these orders are not appealable prior to final judgments on the merits of the underlying litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.650" offset="382673">If a denial of disqualification motion is erroneous, it is fully reviewable on appeal after the trial is terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.801" offset="419245">We also hold that although the Eighth Circuit properly reached this conclusion, it committed error by making its decision perspective only and reaching the merits of the disqualification motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.563" offset="478281">The provisions of 28 U.S.C. 1291 are jurisdictional and once the Court of Appeals determined that the order was not appealable, it should have dismissed the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.167" offset="532720">Reasons for these conclusions are more fully set forth in an opinion filed this morning with the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.626" offset="562500">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.065" offset="576293">The case is remanded with instructions to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.785" offset="603147">Justice Rehnquist joined by the Chief Justice has filed an opinion concurring in the result.</text>
