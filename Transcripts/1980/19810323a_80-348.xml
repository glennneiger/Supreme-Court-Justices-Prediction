            <text syncTime="34.658" offset="287506">This is a case which involves the very difficult and complex interplay of our federal antitrust laws which promote competition, our federal labor laws which tend to stifle competition, and a labor exemption which attempts to accommodate these conflicting laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.542" offset="359082">There is very little dispute over the basic operative facts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.696" offset="375696">Equity is a union whose 23,000 members include virtually every actor who is allowed to appear on the legitimate stage in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.426" offset="414566">Petitioners are theatrical agents located in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.283" offset="434001">They represent actors who belong to Actors' Equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.954" offset="448734">Although they are independent contractors, the petitioners as agents perform services and in effect work for the actors who are members of Actor's Equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.747" offset="491889">All of the petitioners are regulated and licensed as employment agencies under New York State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.276" offset="521982">All are members of NATR, the National Association of Talent Representatives, a trade association of theatrical agents located in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.772" offset="560016">TARA is a similar trade association of theatrical agents located in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.441" offset="582690">The members of TARA compete with the members of NATR.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.237" offset="597841">Most of the petitioners are very small agencies.</text>

            <text syncTime="474.386" offset="2046488">It's our position that Carroll is a very unique decision which should be confined to peculiar facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.914" offset="2076581">In Carroll the Supreme Court was dealing with the AFM's activities in the unusual one-shot club date music field.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.020" offset="2108973">The primary purpose of unions is the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.769" offset="2127990">Nevertheless, in the club date music industry there are no collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.594" offset="2151291">To the best of our knowledge, and the unions haven't cited any exceptions, the club date music industry is the only industry where you have unions and no collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.777" offset="2192042">This is apparently due to the very diverse nature of the club date music employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.619" offset="2215343">These employers generally hire bands for non-commercial purposes sporadically, often once in a lifetime.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.631" offset="2243451">A typical club date employer is the father of the bride who hires a band for his daughter's wedding.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.004" offset="2264871">It's obviously impossible for the AFM to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement with a group as diverse as fathers of the bride.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.424" offset="2298622">Because there was no collective bargaining agreement in Carroll, the union in order to insure that its musician members got scale wages unilaterally mandated scale wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.482" offset="2342821">Now, in Carroll, in order to provide that agents would then not book jobs for union members at less than scale, they had to regulate the agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.258" offset="2389946">In Carroll the club date employers, the fathers of the bride, did not pay the union member musicians directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.115" offset="2413351">This is unlike the situation of Equity where Equity producers directly play Equity actors.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.363" offset="2438324">In Carroll the club date employers paid the orchestra leaders who often function also as booking agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.594" offset="2467268">Accordingly, if the agents were not regulated by the union, there was no assurance that the agents would pay scale or any other wages over to the union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.293" offset="2502063">The Carroll Court predicated its regulation of agents upon two very specific findings of fact, and I quote them:</text>
            <text syncTime="596.335" offset="2534246">"The booking agent regulations were adopted because of experience that (1) many booking agents charged exorbitant fees to members, and (2) booked engagements for musicians at wages which were below union scale. "</text>
            <text syncTime="612.408" offset="2598507">This is from page 113.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.423" offset="2606553">Here, as I previously noted, it is impossible for a theatrical agent to book a job for an Equity member at less than scale because of Equity's collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.186" offset="2649603">Thus, Equity has not even attempted to prove that since the advent of collective bargaining agreements any theatrical agent ever booked a job for any Equity member at less than scale.</text>

            <text syncTime="795.850" offset="3332339">In Carroll, again, I must stress that the agency regulations were predicated solely upon the effect that agents had upon the union member scale wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.235" offset="3389809">Contrary to the union's arguments here, the Carroll court did not in any way rely on such arguments as agents control access to employment, or that it's necessary to regulate agents' commissions to eliminate wage competition between union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.933" offset="3452607">The unions offer three reasons to justify their pervasive and exhaustive regulation of agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.274" offset="3477998">They say agents control access to employment, they say that the prohibition of commissions on scale jobs is necessary to prevent invasion of union-negotiated minimums, and they say that the regulation of agents' commissions is necessary somehow to eliminate wage competition among union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.047" offset="3553126">Taken separately or collectively, these reasons do not justify Equity's exhaustive regulation of agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.700" offset="3587712">Assuming that it is the agents rather than the producers who control access to employment and recognizing that agents admittedly have greater access to most employers than do most actors, that circumstance just does not justify the existence of Equity's pervasive franchising system because it's not intimately related to wages, hours, or working conditions, which are the subject of numerous collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.017" offset="3700979">The unions have not cited any case in which it was held that a union is justified in imposing restraints of trade upon independent business persons simply because those business persons have greater access to potential employers than union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.777" offset="3763986">Virtually every employment agency exists in business because that employment agency has greater access to an employer than the applicant does.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.272" offset="3805991">This is true for employment agencies who place dishwashers, who place corporate executives, who place lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.222" offset="3829815">Why should a union member be treated any differently than any applicant who gets a job from an employment agency which is licensed and regulated?</text>
            <text syncTime="928.954" offset="3864715">Finally, in this connection, I would note, it's the unions who control access to the employment of agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.700" offset="3895748">The regulation of agents' commissions is not necessary to prevent wage competition among union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.494" offset="3926886">Now, there was no such argument made by the unions below and there was no such finding by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.865" offset="3956352">Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals here held that the union, Equity, could not eliminate wage competition without regulating agents' commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.361" offset="4010373">There was absolutely no finding of fact in the record to justify that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.000" offset="4032943">There was no evidence offered that if you struck the franchising system it would result in actors competing with each other for agents' service.</text>

            <text syncTime="1908.935" offset="7784649">For example, a union I know in the restaurant industry in New York signed a collective bargaining agreement with all the employers which said that employees could only be engaged through the New York State Employment Service, because they didn't want their members who would be hired for jobs to pay employment agency fees.</text>
