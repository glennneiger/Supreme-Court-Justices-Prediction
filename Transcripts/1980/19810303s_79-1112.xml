            <text syncTime="10.860" offset="135529">This case comes to us from the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and presents the question of whether a process for curing synthetic rubber which includes in several of its steps the use of a mathematical formula and a programmed digital computer is subject matter eligible for patent protection under 35 U.S.C. Section 101.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.349" offset="233541">That section provides for the issuance of patents to whoever invents or discovers any new or useful process, machines, manufacture or composition of matter or any new and useful improvement thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.344" offset="293518">The respondents claim to have invented a process that will ensure the creation of a perfectly cured rubber product.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.719" offset="322984">Previously, the industry have been unable to obtain a perfect cure because it could not precisely measure the temperature inside the molding press, thus making it difficult to make the necessary computations to determine how long the cure should take.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.010" offset="392156">Respondents characterized their contribution to the art as inhering in the process of constantly measuring and finding the temperature inside the mold and feeding these temperature measurements into a computer which calculates the proper cure time and then signals the device to open the press at the completion of the cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.305" offset="481286">A process is eligible for patent protection if it transforms or reduces an article to a different state or thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.024" offset="512215">Processes for curing rubber have historically been eligible for patent protection and it cannot be doubted that respondents' claim involves the transformation of an article in this case uncured synthetic rubber into a different state.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.022" offset="576163">We hope the respondents' process for patent protection does not lose its eligibility under Section 101 because it uses as a mathematical formula and a program digital computer and several of its steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.602" offset="634573">While a mathematical formula, like a law of nature, cannot be the subject of a patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.479" offset="657978">Respondents do not seek to patent a mathematical formula, instead they seek protection for a complete process for curing synthetic rubber beginning with the loading of a mold with uncured rubber and ending with the opening of the press at the completion of the cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.837" offset="727464">A claim drawn to subject matter otherwise statutory does not become nonstatutory simply because it uses a mathematical formula, computer program or digital computer.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.121" offset="780649">Respondents' claims must be considered as a whole because we do not view their claims as an attempt to patent a mathematical formula, but rather to be drawn to an industrial process for the molding of rubber products.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.383" offset="837596">We affirm the judgment of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.061" offset="856404">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion with which Justice Brennan, Justice Marshall and Justice Blackmun joined.</text>
