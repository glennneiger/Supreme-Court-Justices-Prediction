            <text syncTime="82.302" offset="476348">This case is a multi-facet case which arose out of the 8th Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.593" offset="513546">It concerns the proposition as to whether or not collateral estoppel applies when a prisoner seeks to invoke the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court under 42 United States Code Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.804" offset="594421">In this particular case the 8th Circuit held that because of the special role of the federal courts in protecting civil rights and because habeas corpus is now unavailable to the appellant in this case under the decision of Stone v. Powell, it is the duty of that court to consider fully, unencumbered by the doctrine of collateral estoppel, the appellant's 1983 claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.012" offset="739244">This goes back to a number of decisions of this Court, and I guess you would have the starting point would be the original Ku Klux Klan Act, or the Civil Rights Act, wherein the Congress gave the power to federal courts to determine constitutional rights and to give persons remedies for damages and a federal forum to air their constitutional claims, the reason being that there was great distrust that the state courts would not comply with federal constitutional law, and make a mockery of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.577" offset="929416">However, this particular Act has been somewhat modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.183" offset="971838">I believe this Court has stated that the state courts are able to rule constitutional issues involving federal constitutional law, and that some trust has to be placed in state courts concerning this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.083" offset="1071522">Going back to the Civil Rights Act, I believe that in this day and age things have drastically changed and that state courts are applying constitutional law, federal constitutional law, and are complying with all decisions of this particular Court, especially in the role of search and seizure.</text>
