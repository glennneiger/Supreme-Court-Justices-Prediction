            <text syncTime="52.073" offset="358042">This case presents to the Court one of the four principal purposes for which the 1972 amendments to the Longshoremen's Act were made, according to the Senate committee report, and that purpose, as the report stated it, was to provide a special cause of action for damages against third parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="91.526" offset="515822">--Yes, Your Honor, it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.400" offset="523345">I was simply quoting from the four stated purposes, stated principal purposes in the Senate report, and I think that probably that purpose of getting rid of Sieracki was subsumed in that statement in this purpose, to provide a new or specified cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.346" offset="595130">I quite agree that that was the intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.485" offset="607668">Very much a part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.298" offset="610907">The court below, and the respondent here in defining that specified cause of action would, we submit, impose upon the vessel a responsibility for longshoremen's injury which is without counterpart in any significant body of law, and let me explain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.476" offset="707665">First, I'd like to remind the Court of the relations involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.880" offset="729294">The longshoreman here, as in most such cases, was not an employee of the shipowner, and thus the shipowner was not by virtue of that relationship under those special duties of care which employers traditionally have toward their direct employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.651" offset="820305">The longshoreman was, instead, as usual, an employee of an expert independent stevedoring company.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.211" offset="858548">This Court in Italia, some years ago, noted that such companies are usually in the best position to enforce safety for their employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.723" offset="896583">This is because the stevedore contractor is in practical control of the area that's been turned over to him, is in control of the operations he's conducting there, and of the men who are doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.904" offset="949350">But more than that, the stevedore contractor here as in other cases has imposed upon him by positive law under Section 41 of the Longshoremen's Act and the numerous regulations which are issued by the Department of Labor, a primary and very positive duty of care for the safety of his employees in the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.534" offset="1059900">And before we get farther into this case, let me point to the specific regulation which bears most sharply on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.872" offset="1101278">There is, or was at the time of this case, as there still is, a regulation issued by the Department of Labor under the Longshoremen's Act, that any defect or malfunction of a winch be reported immediately to the officer in charge of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.240" offset="1170659">But what is much more, the regulation goes on and says that in the case of an electrical winch, when the electromagnetic or other service brake is unable to hold the load, as is alleged in this case, the winch shall not be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.046" offset="1241921">And thus the stevedore contractor was confronted with positive law commanding him to report immediately and not to use the winch if that defect manifested itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.462" offset="1303570">Against that background, then, we ask what was the duty of the vessel owner?</text>
            <text syncTime="295.897" offset="1333350">The respondent here in his brief says that the essential question is not one of duty but whether his</text>
            <text syncTime="307.033" offset="1377863">"interests are entitled to be protected against the defendant's conduct. "</text>
            <text syncTime="314.358" offset="1407224">and to that we ask rhetorically, what conduct?</text>
            <text syncTime="318.982" offset="1425719">Because there is a great deal of difference in this field between conduct and--</text>

            <text syncTime="842.316" offset="3518963">We don't ordinarily delegate duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.502" offset="3531711">We delegate powers and we delegate functions, and what in context this term means is a duty which someone is required to retain after he has delegated by contract the function which is related to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.686" offset="3588449">And I submit that in the context of the maritime industry, and the Longshoremen's Act, what Congress meant here when they rejected the nondelegable duty was to insure that a shipowner hereafter would have the capacity to contract work out free of a retained duty to oversee that work, to protect workmen involved from the consequences of the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.172" offset="3714463">Now, provided, of course, that the shipowner has truly delegated the work, turned over the control of it, which of course means that he must have disclosed what he had superior knowledge of or made available the superior means which he might have had.</text>

            <text syncTime="1159.924" offset="4789454">This is very much at the heart of the contention here that the doctrine of assumption of risk is somehow involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.092" offset="4822160">The key to the question is the validity of the distinction between latency and knowledge or obviousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.636" offset="4856328">This Court, years after it had disposed of the question of assumption of risk in the maritime law, has continued to recognize in its jurisprudence the distinction between latency and knowledge and the significance of those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.300" offset="4942950">In Weyerhaeuser v. Nacirema in 1958, the Court noted the significance of latency as giving rise to a need to warn, and by implication in contrast, to a known, obvious condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.714" offset="5012645">The following year, 1959, in West v. United States, this Court observed the same distinction again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.070" offset="5045977">In 1969, this Court decided Federal Marine Terminals v. Burnside, and in that case quoted in full the portions from the Hugev case in the 9th Circuit and the Mickle case, which we have relied on and quoted in our briefs... quoted them, I venture to say, with at least a modicum of approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.622" offset="5148272">And those sections of those quotations were explicit on the distinction between latency and knowledge obviousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.540" offset="5187874">This case quoted them in close conjunction with citation and quotation, and indeed application of its Kermarec case, which has also been urged here by the respondent, and incorrectly, we think, as a reason why our formulation cannot be applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1293.511" offset="5323815">We do not embrace 343 and 343(a), precisely because they have been embraced somewhere and rejected somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.319" offset="5366970">When the state court cases which form the body of law from which these rules must be drawn are examined, we find, of course, that some of them deal with real property, some of them deal with other matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.062" offset="5433947">The restatement synthesizes them and formulates their rules, and if we choose to use the restatement, as a number of courts below have done, we still have choices within the restatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.386" offset="5479296">But the result doesn't make much difference, or any at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.603" offset="5496119">Whether you choose from the restatement those sections which have to do with real property and analogize the vessel to real property, or choose sections which relate to chattels, since the vessel is in law and in fact a chattel, the result comes out the same way, because the principle is the same, and it's expressed in both sections, that the vessel is only liable in those case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.651" offset="5624328">The occupier, the furnisher of the chattel, the vessel is only liable on the basis of superior knowledge, means, and control.</text>

            <text syncTime="1733.896" offset="7085304">First of all, the amendments said that if there was negligence and that negligence of a shipowner injured a longshoreman, that he had a suit for negligence against the shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.091" offset="7154058">Secondly, it did away with any indemnity actions by the shipowner against the stevedoring company for the breach of the warranty of workmanlike service.</text>

            <text syncTime="1777.785" offset="7260847">There is no mention in the statute about standards involving landbased duties.</text>

            <text syncTime="3755.540" offset="15171874">There are, however, other negligence cases, not so many for the reason that Mr. Justice Stewart and others pointed out, but there are other negligence cases before 1972, which we have cited in the brief and which we submit are harmonious with the formulation of duty which the restatement would lay down and which we have adopted here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3801.881" offset="15357239">We have stated it separately, and not in restatement terms, and we feel it can be reconciled or can be supported by the restatement, by any of a number of other sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.064" offset="15394019">The oil spill was discussed and I'd like to point out that as we read the oil spill illustration, it illustrates the difference between unseaworthiness before and negligence after.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.950" offset="15449503">And where it refers to notice, what it means is that in negligence notice is necessary, but it doesn't mean that notice is always sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.898" offset="15489314">There are instances, of course, in which the vessel owner would be held for the oil spill, and instances in which he wouldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.160" offset="15522333">It depends on whether the spill is obvious or not, whether it's in an area that's under the control of the stevedore, whether it was created by the vessel's personnel, when it was created, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.797" offset="15564965">If it's an oil spill in an area over which the vessel has retained essential control but which longshoremen have to pass through, that presents an entirely different situation and one which arises in the course of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3866.120" offset="15614179">So, there's no pat result so far as oil spills are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3871.227" offset="15634659">Finally, it was suggested... it's been suggested that there was a big difference here, whether... as to what rule you might apply to the stevedore and to the longshoreman himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.424" offset="15707489">And I'd like to suggest that, as was explicitly said by this Court in Federal Marine Terminals v. Burnside, if Kermarec does mean anything in these circumstances in abolishing the distinction between licensees and invitees and other irrational distinctions, it means as was pointed out in Federal Marine Terminals v. Burnside that the same rule of duty, the same duty of care applies to the stevedore contractor and to his employees and that that distinction should not be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.362" offset="15843221">That was quite explicit there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.518" offset="15847818">The fortuity, finally, of presence of someone on the vessel should not determine the duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.998" offset="15889719">There is no duty to be there and inspect, as this Court recognized in West, and therefore no special duty because one happens to be there.</text>
