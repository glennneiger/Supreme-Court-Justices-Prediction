            <text syncTime="429.786" offset="1870669">Because if we do, then the fact that there is a power on the part of the municipality to enact zoning, would not in and of itself immediately then set forth that there is no First Amendment issue?</text>
            <text syncTime="444.596" offset="1929915">What we have here is a zoning issue, but it's a zoning issue where in the very terms of that zoning ordinance, we have a burden, a restraint, an impingement, and finally a total prohibition of a form of communication.</text>

            <text syncTime="811.785" offset="3398728">The concept is to develop the community, and therefore it is not directed toward the regulation of freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.356" offset="3428925">The third aspect, however, the moment they open that unit to commercial enterprises, is there a substantial, compelling reason that's being advanced by the enactment of this ordinance and is there any other way in which that could have been accomplished, the furthering of that purpose, other than by the total ban?</text>

            <text syncTime="1038.910" offset="4307162">What are the consequences, what is it that is trying to be avoided by drawing that distinction?</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.799" offset="4338718">Is it going to be a question of traffic?</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.282" offset="4344674">All communities have a problem with traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.901" offset="4355123">In fact we couldn't possibly generate the traffic of a supermarket.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.720" offset="4370483">That's why we have traffic rules, that's why we have policemen, and we don't come along and ban all supermarkets because it creates a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.292" offset="4404756">It's possible no matter where that there could be unruliness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.363" offset="4420952">We don't ban every type of activity where unruliness may follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.232" offset="4440491">What we do is that we form other means of curbing, the less restrictive manner of achieving the purpose that's involved in the enactment and the doctrine of any zoning ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.739" offset="4490542">And this is implicit where there is a First Amendment or a fundamental right, that these must be adhered to; they must be within the contemplation of the community.</text>

            <text syncTime="1602.156" offset="6560171">There is a further suggestion in the documents that have been presented to you, that we have a right to go into chancery and that we can get a restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.326" offset="6592876">And what happens is that that rule in chancery deals with civil cases and we were already in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.332" offset="6620880">The question as to whether or not courts will begin to in any way enjoin pending criminal proceedings, Donbrowski v. Pfister being one of the cases that specifically sets forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.371" offset="6665079">That is a rare, rare exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.489" offset="6673543">It is not the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.508" offset="6681588">And then lastly, when we have the entire question of declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.162" offset="6704158">We were beyond declaratory judgment at that point on a civil basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.447" offset="6717324">We were already in the criminal courts, and declaratory judgment is that there may well be a controversy between individuals that can be resolved by means of this method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.486" offset="6761523">So that at the time that we were presented with process, there was really nothing that we could do except go along with the process, fight it in the criminal court, raise all of the constitutional questions, and then discover that the local court said, if it's nude dancing... not live entertainment, by the way... if it's nude dancing, it's not protected speech at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.133" offset="6844070">Then we get into the county court, which is an appeal but called a trial de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.037" offset="6867685">There we find that the court says, well, there are First Amendment guarantees involved in dancing, but they don't apply in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1775.765" offset="7254610">But that again, that type of banning would be subject to some form of review, and if there were an equivalent use in terms of whatever it be, traffic, congregation of people, littering, whatever it is that may be their concern, if there is a comparable use that is being allowed, then there would have to be a question, either equal protection of the law, or any other aspect that would then allow them to make that distinction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1833.951" offset="7487309">And when we went into the question of a fundamental right where there is First Amendment, the requirement on the part of the state is not only brought to bear sooner but it's a deeper problem that they have.</text>

            <text syncTime="2710.479" offset="10993464">I think that the combining of compatible uses into zones and the blending of compatible zones into a comprehensive zoning ordinance of compatible zones into a comprehensive zoning ordinance is as has been said by this Court the most essential function performed by local government because it's in that way that the quality of life in these communities can be preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.175" offset="11080295">Officially, the devotion of the limited amount of commercial space that a town like the Borough of Mount Ephraim has to the satisfaction of immediate needs of the residents of a borough is certainly a compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.337" offset="11148945">The avoidance of those problems inherent in the omitted uses of live entertainment, like traffic, crowds, parking, trash, demands for medical and police facilities, the avoidance of these things for a Borough like Mount Ephraim is a compelling state interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3054.014" offset="12367610">We passed the O'Brien test, in that clearly the ordinance is within the power of government and clearly is unrelated to the suppression of expression.</text>

            <text syncTime="3068.774" offset="12426646">The appellant, however, denies that we advance a significant governmental interest or that the ordinance is sufficiently narrow so as to not impinge upon the First Amendment any more than is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.515" offset="12481608">We submit that we do advance a significant governmental interest, as I've said before, because zoning in and of itself is not just a significant governmental interest but perhaps the most essential governmental interest served by any local community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.274" offset="12540645">In addition, what we have really striven to do in this matter is devote the limited amount of commercial land which fronts on this main highway through the Borough of Mount Ephraim to satisfy the immediate needs of the residents of the Borough of Mount Ephraim, and in so doing we contend that we advance a significant governmental interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3221.488" offset="13037494">Entertainment is accommodated throughout the County of Camden; specifically, live nude entertainment is accommodated throughout the county of Camden, and it has to be remembered that the traditional concepts of zoning... one of the cases cited in my brief is Village of Valley View v. Proffett.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.884" offset="13111054">And in that case the court said that traditional concepts of zoning envision a community as a self contained unit containing its own... or, a municipality as a self contained unit, and containing its own residential, commercial, and industrial areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.545" offset="13177719">Mount Ephraim, like Valley View, is on the periphery of a huge metropolitan center and it is not a self contained unit, it is, as they said in that case, merely an adventitious fragment of the social and economic whole, and as such what is really at issue here is whether the Borough of Mount Ephraim or any such small residential community has the right and the power to determine its character, what it's going to look like in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.849" offset="13310943">We have a town in Mount Ephraim called Tavestock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.303" offset="13328811">According to the 1980 census figures, Tavestock has four homes and nine residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.161" offset="13372174">Certainly an inappropriate town for entertainment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.263" offset="13392654">We have another town called Pine Valley Borough, has 24 residents and 14 homes, another town in which uses of this nature or entertainment in general just doesn't make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.258" offset="13460573">The county of Camden is comprised of 37 separate municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.411" offset="13481157">Some of those municipalities are the type of municipalities where this use would properly be accommodated and in some of those municipalities it just really doesn't make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.386" offset="13529118">This Court in Young v. American Mini Theatres sustained a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction for the City of Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.492" offset="13561510">Implicit in that decision is that the City of Detroit could prohibit these uses or any entertainment uses or any commercial uses or commercial speech uses from the residential areas of Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.870" offset="13630996">Well, the Borough of Mount Ephraim is absolutely indistinguishable from those residential areas of a large metropolitan area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.374" offset="13665059">The fact that we have 37 governing bodies instead of, let's say, a county wide planning board... if we had a county wide planning board, it would be extremely rational to not permit Mount Ephraim to have an entertainment zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.650" offset="13730156">It's just not that kind of a town.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.669" offset="13738202">The entertainment zone would most probably be located in more of the downtown area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.922" offset="13767250">We're on the outskirts of a large market area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.559" offset="13785745">The Philadelphia market area encompasses five counties in Pennsylvania and three counties in New Jersey, and certainly every municipality encompassed within that sprawling megalopolis does not need to accommodate all commercial uses, be they constitutionally protected or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.140" offset="13872158">I maintained initially that this really... I submit that there are really no constitutional issues presented in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.079" offset="13903819">I say that because it would seem to me of necessity that before a content neutral zoning ordinance, clearly valid on its face, can be held to implicate First Amendment principles, there must of necessity be some type of a constitutional showing that the use is not accommodated elsewhere in the community at large, and there should also be some obligation to establish that the proposed site of this use is at least reasonably suitable to accommodate the use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.121" offset="14056060">There's been no showing; the record is barren with respect to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.089" offset="14071943">This could, for example, and does, according to the strip type commercial uses that have grown up in the town of Mount Ephraim, backs up on residences, on home upon home upon home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.784" offset="14138712">That's an inappropriate place to place this kind of a use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.821" offset="14162849">The Library of Congress, as wonderful an institution as that may be, just doesn't belong everywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.977" offset="14199420">There are some places where that is inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.146" offset="14212168">And the real issue before this Court is, who is to decide where these uses are appropriate?</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.668" offset="14250202">Appellants' argument would have you graft on every such zoning ordinance, change the definition of every such zoning ordinance to include constitutionally permissible uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.944" offset="14311329">And in so doing you are really being asked to homogenize zoning at the national level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.400" offset="14341108">If there is anything that does not lend itself to homogenization at the national level, it's zoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.558" offset="14389801">At the municipal level, where these zoning decisions are made, you have decisions like, let's not put the drainage ditch here because Mrs. Jones' septic tank backs up when it rains now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.667" offset="14446225">There is local expertise that goes into the creation of a comprehensive zoning ordinance at the local level which this Court should not interfere with.</text>
