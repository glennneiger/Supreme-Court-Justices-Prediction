            <text syncTime="84.270" offset="487166">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="87.039" offset="498242">This case involves an issue that was left open in Tate v. Short, and that is, may a trial judge revoke the probation of the probationer or offender if he does not have the funds to make the monthly payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.119" offset="582565">The facts in this case are, I think, rather clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.089" offset="602522">There are three probationers, of course; three Petitioners in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.407" offset="623734">Raymond Wood, Edna Allen, and James Tante.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.961" offset="642019">They were convicted several years ago of distributing obscene materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.782" offset="665216">The records show that Mr. Wood was a clerk in a bookstore... no dispute about that... Ms. Allen was a projectionist in a theater, and Mr. Tante was the projectionist in that theater.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.624" offset="728642">The fine imposed on Mr. Tante and Ms. Allen was a $5,000 fine and 12 months on probation... that was after the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.784" offset="781304">They were to pay that fine as directed, which was $500 per month, so they would have paid the fine in approximately 10 months.</text>

            <label>Justice Stewart</label>

            <label>Mr. Glenn Zell</label>
            <text syncTime="167.890" offset="821742">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.759" offset="829161">Mr. Wood was convicted in two counts and he received a $5,000 fine in each count, to run consecutively, and 12 months on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.183" offset="882868">Therefore, he had a 24-month sentence and a $10,000 fine, payable again at the rate of $500 per month over a period of 20 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.291" offset="923306">Thereafter I appealed the case to the Georgia Court of Appeals, and I lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.961" offset="949951">I then certioraried the Georgia Supreme Court and certiorari was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.599" offset="968550">I then certioraried this Court, and cert was denied with some justices dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.151" offset="990702">The case came back to the trial court, through remittitur, that is, and of course while the case was on appeal in Georgia, as in most states in the federal system, the three Petitioners, or offenders, defendants, were not on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.762" offset="1053187">The conviction, I think, was in March of '77, the remittiturs came back in October of 1978, and at that point, the three offenders, the three defendants, started serving their probation, right at the last week of October.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.222" offset="1119015">And the record shows that the probation officers told each one... there was a different officer for each defendant... I don't know whether there were three different probation officers... but anyway, each one said you must pay your fine at the end of next month, at the rate of $500 per month.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.298" offset="1175335">In the record, at page 71, I notified the Court immediately when they were put on probation that they did not have the funds and the fines should be remitted or suspended or some action taken, because there's going to be a problem in this case on this $20,000 in fines.</text>

            <text syncTime="287.853" offset="1301559">Obviously you have your civil penalties certainly, garnishment, levy on any property.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.738" offset="1321099">For example, Mr. Tante was a prison guard at this time, while he was on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.891" offset="1345654">Mr. Wood had a job at a trucking company, I believe, he could have been garnished.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.712" offset="1368955">And Ms. Allen, unfortunately, was on unemployment compensation and I don't think you can garnish that, I'm not sure if you can.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.096" offset="1470519">And certainly some small sum of money could have been affected by garnishment at this point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2112.639" offset="8600694">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.191" offset="8614904">The issue in this case is whether a judge can condition probation on the payment of a fine, revoke that period of probation for non payment of the fine, particularly when the individual has represented to the Court that they had the funds or the means by which to pay the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.955" offset="8697974">Underlying that consideration is whether the sentencing judge could properly consider third party sources as assisting the individual in the payment of the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.430" offset="8747815">Now this case does not involve, as some cases previously to the Court have provided, extending the period of confinement greater than allowed by statute.</text>

            <label>Justice Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="2160.220" offset="8790970">Mr. Attorney General, suppose a man has got the money and he is sentenced to pay $5,000 a month, which is no problem to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.861" offset="8841543">But he starts serving the sentence at the end of the year 1929 and he is caught along with everybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.251" offset="8879159">In Georgia, what happens?</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.536" offset="8888250">Is there any relief for him?</text>

            <label>Mr. John W. Dunsmore, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2186.705" offset="8896922">Yes, he can always go through it in Georgia, at any time, the Courts... we pointed that out in the footnotes, the Court always has the inherent power to modify a sentence or to release the individual from the conditions of his probation at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.482" offset="8964109">Normal procedure as to what percentage of the cases, I could not indicate to you, but that is a means available to a defendant.</text>

            <label>Justice Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="2212.003" offset="8998173">You go to the sentencing judge?</text>

            <label>Mr. John W. Dunsmore, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2213.872" offset="9005592">You go to the sentencing judge because he retains jurisdiction over that case, during that time that the individual is on a period of probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.961" offset="9041954">Now, I think it's important in this case that the individuals, at this time, are not in confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.734" offset="9073092">And I was under the misapprehension, and I'll correct that, on page 9 of my brief, and I indicated that confinement resulted... it did not, as Mr. Zell said, initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.539" offset="9116246">I think the important factor is that these individuals are out on bond, on an appeal bond, that bond was posted on February 13, 1979, which was the date when the judge said that after the hearing in January, of '79, if you don't pay the arrears, I'm going to give you two weeks to pay the arrearage for approximately $1500, then I'm going to revoke probation.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="2265.307" offset="9211332">What was the amount of that bond?</text>

            <label>Mr. John W. Dunsmore, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2266.740" offset="9217079">Now the bond for Mr. Wood is $20,000, and under the Georgia statutory scheme, the maximum amount... or, the amount that would have to be paid for that bond, according to my figures, would be $1,025.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.868" offset="9285624">The statute is Georgia Code 27-501.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.505" offset="9308194">That sets out the fact that you can't charge any more than 10 percent of the first five hundred dollars, or any more than five percent on amounts over $500.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.128" offset="9346646">As to the other two Petitioners, Ms. Allen and Mr. Tante; it was a $10,000 bond and I think my math worked out to something like 525.</text>

            <text syncTime="2364.035" offset="9606304">If I can, the scenario is, this is their first conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.223" offset="9623022">This is what happened: each one of them was arrested and they pursued their constitutional right to submit the matter before a jury; a jury in March of 1977 found them guilty as charged and the judge at that time said I'm going to put your sentence at 12 months, the maximum for these convictions of distributing obscene materials, since it's considered an aggravating... a misdemeanor of a high and aggravating nature, is 12 months and a $5,000 fine or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.192" offset="9750917">Now, after that time, they appealed to the Court of Appeals, then to the Supreme Court of Georgia, then a writ of certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="2420.521" offset="9832210">They entered pleas of guilty to subsequent offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.575" offset="9852482">It was those subsequent offenses which are referred to in our Appendix A on the brief in opposition to writ of certiorari, where Mr. Zell tells the judge yes, I paid the fine, or the employers gave me the money to pay these fines--</text>

            <text syncTime="2453.994" offset="9966062">Well, I think the important part is, of the case, is that he had... and what we're talking about here is sentencing discretion of a trial judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2468.052" offset="10022382">Now, in the United States v. Grayson, this Court said yes, the judge could consider the demeanor of the defendant when he said you know, I find your defense to be highly incredible and you know, basically, I think you're putting the sham on the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.831" offset="10093435">By analogy, cannot the trial judge consider representations to him by third parties that we will pay the fines?</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.438" offset="10135858">Now, what does this do in the mind of the trial judge?</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.940" offset="10145889">He says yes, we're going to put you, I'm going to give you 12 months, and a $5,000 fine.</text>

            <text syncTime="2720.566" offset="11032380">But I think as we pointed out in our brief in this case, at the time the sentences were imposed, the Defendants... Petitioners in this case... sat back in silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.957" offset="11077938">They never went in to the probation officers at that time and said, you know, we can't pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="2751.035" offset="11154320">They refused, and I use the word refused, to pay the fine because they were under the impression, and I think rightly so, from... on the conditions of employment... that their employers would pay the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.328" offset="11207401">And therefore they took no action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.797" offset="11217327">Now, I think what that amounts to in this case, regardless of funds, is are we not deceiving a trial judge?</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.701" offset="11248988">And as Mr. Justice Marshall says, let the judge go down the road,... you know, many times you say well can silence be a condoning aspect?</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.391" offset="11287649">I think it can, in this situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2961.690" offset="11996926">Now that same factor must be viewed in the eyes of the sentencing judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2979.569" offset="12068397">But I think the judge rationally could look to the employers because if they put a stake up in the community for an employer, there's going to be continued employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.841" offset="12105490">Now one of the terms of the probation was that they continue on employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3350.409" offset="13551734">Well I'm not too sure of... when he said unique to Georgia... I take it, in terms of the fact that judges don't place individuals on, let's say, spend five nights in the county jail or work for a health facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.685" offset="13616831">I don't think that's unique, because I have... and this is outside the record, I have heard from other individuals that... where individuals haven't had the fine, that you know, they said, well... like for example, in a traffic case, spend one weekend a month driving around with the hospital ambulance authority or something like that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3404.494" offset="13768132">But I don't think that it... you know, that it's unique, because I do know from some limited experience outside, that you know, other alternatives, depending on who the judge is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.135" offset="13814630">But what we're getting back to, or what I believe we need to get back to is, the sentencing discretion of the judge and the fact that other alternatives are available or he could consider other alternatives, is it unconstitutional to consider financial resources, and is it unconstitutional to enforce the terms of the sentence which is prescribed by law?</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.132" offset="13902610">And that's exactly what we're faced with, and we say it's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.367" offset="13919642">And we say, particularly, that it's not, because there is some element of deception in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.790" offset="13953288">It was, Mr. Justice Marshall said, you know, leading the judge down the path.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.858" offset="13969588">I, as attorney, and even as a citizen, would find that somewhat disturbing and irreprehensible that somebody sits down and misinterprets or misleads the Court, particularly in the context that we're brought up... particularly the aura of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.755" offset="14053180">--I think most criminal defendants and most individuals, when they are faced in a court situation, tend to be honest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.244" offset="14083064">Now, and I'm not supposing this case that the defendants were, you know, were less than honest, but they didn't need to speak up and say the third party is paying the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.652" offset="14132697">I said that after 19 months, particularly on October 23, 1978, or even during that period of time, why didn't they go to their attorney and say look, there's just no way we can pay it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.126" offset="14182643">Why wait three months until the solicitor goes in and says I want an order to revoke your probation?</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.963" offset="14205944">Where is the good faith effort on their part?</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.384" offset="14231649">And I think that's fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.952" offset="14237918">I think we need to reach that issue and I think in reaching it, we would hope that the Court would say that the trial judge in this case did not abuse his discretion.</text>
