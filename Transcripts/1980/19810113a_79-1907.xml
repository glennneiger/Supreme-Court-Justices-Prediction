            <text syncTime="82.081" offset="464545">The questions involve an application of a well-established formula method set out in the regulations for more than 40 years for measuring the gross income from mining of a taxpayer who mines and, thereafter, produces a finished manufactured product, the so-called integrated miner-manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.835" offset="579484">The object of the formula which we also call the proportionate profits method is to determine the price at which the taxpayer would have sold his mine or to itself in a hypothetical sale, so as to confine the depletion deduction to its intended purpose of compensating for the exhaustion of the mineral deposit.</text>

            <text syncTime="166.246" offset="801211">And the underlying theory of the proportionate profits method, which is a cost ratio method which is set out in our brief at pages -- at page 3, it's a formula which essentially multiplies a fraction, the numerator of which is mining costs over total costs, that is, mining plus non-mining costs times the gross sales of the first marketable product which here is finished Portland Cement and that figure --</text>
