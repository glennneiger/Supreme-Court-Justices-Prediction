            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="20.207" offset="172855">In Pennhurst, the first of the cases which we have filed an opinion with the clerk with today, the respondents are patients at the Pennhurst State School and Hospital, an institution in Pennsylvania for the care and treatment of the mentally retarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.073" offset="240355">They brought suit against Pennhurst and various officials responsible for its operations alleging that the inhumane and dangerous conditions deprived them of various constitutional and statutory rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.613" offset="294481">They urge that Pennhurst be closed and that they be moved to smaller less isolated institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.103" offset="324469">The Federal District Court found that certain of the claimed rights were violated and granted the relief sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.542" offset="350174">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed on different grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.042" offset="368251">It construed the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 1975 enacted by Congress and founded Section 6010 of that Act created of mentally retarded persons, a “right to appropriate treatment” in the “least restrictive environment”.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.453" offset="457798">The Act itself established a federal-state grant program whereby the Federal Government will provide financial assistance to any State which agrees to comply with certain conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.845" offset="507431">The Court of Appeals reasoned that because Pennsylvania accepted federal funds under the Act, it was bound under Section 6010 to provide appropriate treatments of -- of patients of Pennhurst.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.952" offset="559885">We disagree in an opinion which we have filed today with the Court -- with the clerk of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.172" offset="580678">In our view, Section 6010 only expresses a congressional preference for certain kinds of treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.584" offset="606383">It does not grant rights to patients or require the States to provide special treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.109" offset="628430">We do find, however, that certain other sections of the Act which were not considered by the Court of Appeals may place certain conditions on the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.433" offset="665733">Accordingly, we reversed the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.978" offset="691960">Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.284" offset="717142">Mr. Justice White joined by Justices Brennan and Marshall has filed a dissent in part.</text>
