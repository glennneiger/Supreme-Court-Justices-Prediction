            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="13.341" offset="208820">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.226" offset="224389">The issue in this case is the constitutionality of the acreage based electoral system of the Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.333" offset="264826">Salt River Project is today, and it always has been, a federal water reclamation project.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.254" offset="292516">It's first owner and operator was the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.223" offset="308399">The Salt River Valley Water Users Association, which is a private corporation organized under the laws of the Territory of Arizona, was formed in 1903 as the entity which could perform the statutory function of guaranteeing the repayment into the reclamation fund of the initial costs advanced by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.653" offset="390110">One of the obligations imposed on the Association by the United States in the initial 1904 contract between the two was the commitment that the only beneficiaries of the Project's water storage and development activities would be the landowners, who had subscribed their lands into... membership in the Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.533" offset="469626">And that obligation, imposed on the Association by the United States, is still in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.535" offset="485613">So that from the beginning, the benefits of this Project have been proportionate to land ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.139" offset="516020">In 1917, the role of the Association changed from guarantor to operator and for the next 20 years the care, operation, maintenance and control of the Project were vested in this private corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.281" offset="568578">In 1937, the District was brought into being by the landowners of the Association as an agricultural improvement district, which under the laws of the state of Arizona, is a political subdivision of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.972" offset="619360">Prior to the creation of the District, the Association and its members had experienced severe financial difficulties and the primary purpose of the District was to give the Project a better interest rate on its bonds by making that interest tax free.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.382" offset="681009">Over the decades, since 1937, the District has changed in several ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.970" offset="703370">And the most important of those changes, for present purposes, are two: the first is that though the physical boundaries of this District and Association have remained the same, the number of people living in those boundaries has increased so that the number of landowners entitled to use the water stored and developed by the Project, as well as the number of electric customers, has increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.637" offset="814025">And the second change is reflected in a pair of statutory amendments in 1969 and 1974, through which the Arizona legislature has significantly increased the extent of small landowner influence in the election to board of directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.582" offset="885809">The 1969 change eliminated the formerly existing one acre limitation as a condition for the franchise, and the 1974 change expanded the board from 10 to 14 with the further provision that those four additional members of the board of directors would be elected at large, on a one landowner/one vote basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.164" offset="980163">But even more important than how the District has changed is how it has not changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.732" offset="998449">It still serves raw water to the same lands, the number of persons benefitted has changed but its purpose and function have not.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.874" offset="1046932">The Arizona Supreme Court has held and the parties to this case have stipulated that the primary purpose of the Salt River Project is today and always has been, the storage, development and delivery of raw water for the benefit of those landowners who were willing to risk their property in order to bring it into existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.185" offset="1120180">Now the Appellees take a different view of the significance of these changes in the number of people served by the Project.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.541" offset="1157692">They contend that the significance of this increase in population is that the District has effectively been converted into the equivalent of a city.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.813" offset="1198756">And they refer, for example, to the District's city like status and have asserted that it has all the attributes of sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.753" offset="1234492">Two comments with respect to this view are appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.870" offset="1246926">The first is that this view is absolutely essential to their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.172" offset="1268137">The second is that it is squarely inconsistent with controlling holdings of the Arizona Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.178" offset="1296141">Because the Arizona Supreme Court has ruled, and I'm quoting,</text>
            <text syncTime="288.463" offset="1309306">"that the District's function is purely business and economic and not political and governmental, and that it's limited governmental attributes have been conferred for the purpose of better enabling it to function and accomplish the business and economic purpose for which it was organized. "</text>
            <text syncTime="307.792" offset="1386629">The significant point is that this pivotal issue is an issue of Arizona law, out of the entire panoply of governmental powers and governmental functions that any entity might have, the issue is how many are enjoyed by this creature of Arizona law, this Agricultural Improvement District.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.957" offset="1471266">And the answer has been supplied by the Arizona Supreme Court; only those incidents of public ness, of governmentalness, that are absolutely essential in order to enable the District to perform its proprietary business economic activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.517" offset="1537512">What this case really involves is state encouragement of private investment in water reclamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.539" offset="1573666">Which, I submit, is a most appropriate endeavor for an arid state like Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.176" offset="1596131">But it's our position that there's nothing in the United States Constitution that says that Arizona can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.963" offset="1623298">And we also believe that that is the thrust of this Court's decision in Salyer v. Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District.</text>

            <text syncTime="383.339" offset="1688813">In other words, Arizona has an interest in seeing to it that water reclamation be carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.727" offset="1710338">And what it has done through these statutes is to encourage private investment in that water reclamation by assuring that those who make the investment will be entitled to keep the fruits of their investment.</text>

            <text syncTime="418.246" offset="1828412">Now, its economic objectives are to permit it to generate some income which in turn can be used for reclamation purposes, in order to conserve, store and deliver water.</text>

            <text syncTime="3534.073" offset="14291746">First, with respect to the financial stake, with all due respect, Mr. Meyerson is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.627" offset="14314002">Paragraph 11 of the stipulation specifies that the Association has levied and collected assessments upon the lands and that hasn't been done for some time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.251" offset="14356529">There is an annual assessment that comes each year, but in addition... there have been these special assessments to which Paragraph 11 of the Stipulation refers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.421" offset="14385159">But even more important, from the beginning it was these people, because of taking, they were the ones who submitted their lands and they did not have to submit them, it was a voluntary matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.896" offset="14427060">And some of the lands were excluded because the residents of Tempe, for example, elected not to submit their lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.883" offset="14454959">Now with regard to the interchange between Justice White and Mr. Meyerson concerning the fact that the fundamental complaint is the large landowners can run the District.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.008" offset="14499471">I'd like to clarify just exactly to what extent the large landowners do have control of this District at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.845" offset="14526848">Mr. Meyerson has informed the Court, outside of the record but I have no objection because it was correct information, that today a majority of the lands within the Salt River Project are urban.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.486" offset="14573450">It's about 55 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.136" offset="14580033">But the consequence of that shift has been that out of the 14 members of the board of directors, ten of them are elected by constituencies that are also dominantly urban.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.162" offset="14632173">And that includes the four members elected at large and includes six of those elected from districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.564" offset="14653698">And with regard to the question, Justice Stevens, has there ever been a contest... in the last election, there was a lawyer who beat out a landowner in one of these at large districts.</text>
