            <text syncTime="69.032" offset="368132">There are actually two major issues raised in this case with respect to the meaning of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.194" offset="392792">The first question is whether under Section 10 of that Act, the Army Corps of Engineers has authority to override state water rights laws even where there are no impacts upon federal navigation interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="116.996" offset="559975">Briefly, the facts of the case are very complicated but I -- I will try to just very briefly skip over them as I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.783" offset="583172">The case involves water exports by the State Water Project which is a massive reclamation project in California that essentially exports waters from the northern part of the State to the central and the southern parts of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.611" offset="634477">The projects actually release waters to flow downstream in to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and then pumping plants on the south into the Delta, pump the waters to the users in central and southern California.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.235" offset="680974">The -- this project is extremely vital to California's economic health.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.159" offset="700619">It provides water to supply to about 14 million people, which is over half of California's population.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.117" offset="728517">It provides irrigation water to about one million acres of prime agricultural land and in fact, the State Project has been in operation since 1967, so it's been exporting water in that -- since that period.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="171.311" offset="777314">Well, the Central Valley Project was authorized before the Federal -- the Federal Government made any contribution to it all, wasn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="roderick_eugene_walston" startTime="179.938" stopTime="327.689">
            <label>Mr. Roderick Eugene Walston</label>
            <text syncTime="179.938" offset="811796">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.599" offset="814408">The Central Valley Project is a federal reclamation facility that essentially parallels the state facility and it's been operational since the 1930s.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.275" offset="849099">The -- the precise issue in this case is whether Section 10 of the Act authorizes the Corps of Engineers to control the allocation of water from this project, as I say, pursuant to Section 10 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.704" offset="898836">The Section 10 essentially contains two clauses here before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.249" offset="913046">The first clause is, in our view, of the major clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.208" offset="924854">It establishes a general prohibition against obstructions to navigable capacity without the approval of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.664" offset="950663">And the third clause makes it unlawful to alter the condition of navigable waters without the approval of the Army Corps of Engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.678" offset="978770">And the State's argument may be briefly summarized as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.379" offset="993503">Section 10, in our view, applies only where there's an effect on navigable capacity as that term is used within the meaning of the first clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.723" offset="1026940">And therefore, Section 10 applies only where there is an effect upon federal navigation interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.069" offset="1052331">Now, the question, “Does Section 10 apply to water allocations that are adopted by the States under the water rights laws?”</text>
            <text syncTime="247.104" offset="1080439">And on that question, we raise essentially two alternative arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.128" offset="1096530">First, we argue that Section 10 does not apply to state water allocations at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.776" offset="1119100">Second, we argue that if the -- if Section 10 does apply in that context, the Court should develop a kind of common law or rule of reason test governing its meaning in that kind of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.185" offset="1168733">Then, in this rule of reason test, we argue that Section 10 should apply to state water allocations only where there is a substantial effect upon the capacity of waters to support actual navigation in the area where commerce actually takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.847" offset="1235397">To state it very briefly, we argue that Section 10 applies only where -- to state water allocations only where there is a substantial effect upon federal navigation interest and concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.993" offset="1280014">Now, the Court of Appeals rejected our analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.242" offset="1289001">It held that Section 10 applies even though -- whenever there is an effect on the condition of navigable waters, even though there are maybe no effect on navigation or navigable capacity.In other words, Section 10 applies without regard to the existence of federal navigation interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.133" offset="1356501">And it further held that Section 10 fully applies to state water allocations and that the Court should not develop any kind of common law or rule of reason test with respect to the meaning of Section 10 in that situation.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="327.689" stopTime="339.096">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="327.689" offset="1402790">When you talk about federal common law, do you mean something different than a construction of Section 10 just to overrule Erie against Tompkins?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="roderick_eugene_walston" startTime="339.096" stopTime="578.912">
            <label>Mr. Roderick Eugene Walston</label>
            <text syncTime="339.096" offset="1448452">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.736" offset="1450960">We mean precisely a construction of Section 10, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.054" offset="1468201">It is the same construction of Section 10 indeed that this Court rendered in 1899 in the Rio Grande case.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.483" offset="1497980">And at that time, the Court held that the Section 10 applies only where there is a substantial effect on navigable capacity in an area where navigation is a recognized set.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.554" offset="1546254">That's precisely the language of the Court's decision, so the Court in the case appeared to adapt a rule of reason test which we regard as kind of a common law test.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.737" offset="1590976">If the Court of Appeals' interpretation of Section 10 is correct, then we concede that Section 10 fully applies here, for the water exports in this case, do affect the condition of navigable waters and we can see that.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.684" offset="1646774">But if our interpretation of Section 10 is correct, then Section 10 does not apply in this case because the State Water Project exports in this case do not substantially affect navigable capacity in that part of the Delta where commerce actually takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.900" offset="1715632">The exports at most reduced water levels in the Delta by only about one inch in that part of the Delta where commerce actually takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.946" offset="1751786">And this reduction has no substantial effect on actual federal navigation interest in that part of the Delta.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.574" offset="1786268">Now, a rule of reason test is in -- is in essence in an attempt to accommodate conflicting your belief, potentially conflicting goals in the subjects -- on the subjects of navigation and reclamations.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.719" offset="1830885">Specifically, we are urging this Court to attempt in accommodation between federal navigation interest on the one hand and the congressional policy on the other hand by deferring to the water right laws and the water supply system that have been developed by the western states.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.417" offset="1897654">Indeed, the very purpose of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 was to prevent obstructions to navigable capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.111" offset="1924508">Thus, to protect federal environmental concern -- federal navigation concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.304" offset="1945197">And this Court has held that that -- that Act was passed for the very purpose of overcoming this Court's decision in the Willamette Bridge case, a case in which this Court held that there is no federal common law with respect to obstructions to navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.706" offset="2006846">Therefore, in our view, the 1899 Act should be applied at least in this situation only where there is an effect, an actual effect on actual visible federal navigation interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.473" offset="2053866">And this result, we believe, is reinforced by the -- the concept that Congress has historically delegated, brought authority and control to the western states to control their water rights system.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.937" offset="2099737">This delegation of authority is based upon several laws that were passed by Congress, both this century and then the prior century relating to the subjects of reclamation, dessert lands, mining and a vast array of other types of subject matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.568" offset="2158251">And under this delegation of authority, the western states have actually developed administrative water rights systems in which they have been trying and successfully trying to control and manage their water resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.353" offset="2209451">And indeed, the water exports in this very case have been authorized under California's own water right system.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.316" offset="2233275">California's own water right system is controlled by the State Water Resources Control Board, which has authorized the allocation of the exports of water in this case, subject however, to conditions that were intended to protect the environmental quality of the Delta itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.689" offset="2290744">These state water allocation systems that have been developed by the westerns states are absolutely vital to their economic growth and prosperity.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.390" offset="2321569">The west is unique in many ways and Congress has dealt with it -- with the west in a unique way.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.815" offset="2347273">The west has much land but very little water and so, the western states have, in affect, developed reclamation systems for the purpose of transporting water from where it originates, to where it may be used, and where it is needed by human beings.</text>

            <text syncTime="604.852" offset="2511427">Well, in practical reality, most state water allocations affect the condition of navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.833" offset="2535355">Thus, as a practical matter, the Court of Appeals' decision would allow the -- the Corps of Engineers essentially to control most water allocations that are authorized under the water rights laws of the western states.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.239" offset="2584988">If this is so, then the Corps of Engineers would function as kind of a super water agency in the west.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.717" offset="2618842">It would be responsible for ultimately controlling the -- the diversion of water and the division of water among competing economic and environmental interest in the western states.</text>

            <text syncTime="1441.997" offset="5860011">This approach is intended to preserve the traditional institutional roles that have been carried out by the Corps of Engineers in the western states with respect to the control and management of the water resources in the west.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.986" offset="5915913">The Corps of Engineers has traditionally focused on navigation and has traditionally been concerned with navigation, but not with water allocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.682" offset="5950708">By the same token, the States have traditionally focused on water allocation, and under the congressional delegation of authority that I mentioned earlier, have traditionally been responsible for allocating water among competing needs in the west.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.376" offset="5997520">Therefore, the Corps has no particular expertise over this subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.688" offset="6014761">States, on the other had, have a lot of expertise on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.294" offset="6029180">But the Court of Appeals' decision would effectively allow the Corps to essentially usurp this historic rule occupied by the States and begin to take over this role for the Corps of Engineers itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.023" offset="6084142">It would allow the Corps, essentially, to occupy a role that has been historically occupied by the western states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.196" offset="6112772">So, our approach is designed to achieve some kind of accommodation or balance between federal and state interests; federal navigation interest and state reclamation interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.018" offset="6148090">On the one hand, our approach would prevent the States from impairing federal navigation interest and therefore would protect the federal concerns that underly the Rivers and Harbors act of 1899.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.550" offset="6194170">But on the other hand, our approach would authorize the States to reclaim their arid lands in situations where there are no impacts upon federal navigation interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.472" offset="6225934">So in essence, we are urging that this Court seek some kind of accommodation or a balance between federal and state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.017" offset="6256132">I -- I emphasize once again very strongly that this Court has, in effect, followed and adapted the very approach which we are urging.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.090" offset="6288419">In 1899, in the Rio Grande case, this Court appeared to adopt a rule of reason test in defining the meaning of Section 10, and its definition of that test is essentially the same that we are offering to this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.938" offset="6335753">In the Sanitary District and Wisconsin cases, the Court held that Section 10 was applicable to water diversions from Lake Michigan that reduced shipping capacity in the Great Lakes region by about three million tons each year, and thus had a substantial effect on the rights of the many states that bordered Lake Michigan.</text>

            <text syncTime="1579.612" offset="6410463">But that was because the State was a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.473" offset="6421957">And when states are parties, this Court has original jurisdiction and we have to fashion a body of common law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1592.270" offset="6461141">So the Court obviously had to reach the question in that case and you're suggesting the possibility that the Court may not have to do so here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.089" offset="6488413">But nonetheless, the Sanitary District case stands for the proposition where there is an effect on federal navigation interest, as there were in that case in Lake Michigan then Section 10 surely applies, but we don't have that kind of an effect in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.957" offset="6547868">So essentially, we are arguing that the Court should accommodate federal and state interest in this case by seeking an accommodation or balance of these interests in the fields of reclamation and navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.305" offset="6585275">This is the same test the Court followed in the Rio Grande case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.894" offset="6599590">We urge that it be followed here and I would like, if I may, Mr Chief Justice, to reserve a few moments for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1778.615" offset="7206467">We think that the characterization of that -- and that flow reversals -- we think the characterization of that physical situation by the State is being something very de minimis and beneath notice is incorrect, but characterizations by the private respondents -- respondents that they are egregious which were obvious to everybody we think is also incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.749" offset="7299045">We think that they are -- it's a situation there which when finally and fully brought to the attention of the Corps and do reflection, they're recognized as -- as meeting the threshold requirements of Clause 3 and requiring a permit, and that's what they are processing at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.145" offset="7372606">In this Court, therefore, as they did below, the present -- the federal respondents are challenging the right of the Sierra Club to bring this suit, and there, it's saying the State is wrong in suggesting that there is some sort of special exemption for States or for States with state water allocation systems, or for state water allocations systems that don't substantially impair navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.219" offset="7460899">I will devote the first part of my presentation with private right of action issues since we agreed that that's the threshold issue and you don't reach the question on the merits if you agree with us on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.534" offset="7498202">In recent decisions of this Court, considering the question whether a private right of action under a federal statute may be implied from the terms of that statute, this Court has made it clear that the critical question is congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.106" offset="7548462">I refer the cases such as Transamerica Mortgage Investors Association, Touche Ross, Cannon against University of Chicago and the Amtrak case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.510" offset="7582108">This Court has indicated in those same decisions that there are various critical tight categories of evidence respecting congressional intent critical in showing a -- an absence of any intent to create a specific implied remedy under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.500" offset="7650026">One of those two -- one critical factor is whether the statute contains within itself a specific remedy, and moreover a remedy that is specifically entrusted to the federal officers to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.916" offset="7703734">Another critical factor is whether it appears that Congress enacted the statute for the benefit of the public at large or whether it enacted the statute for the benefit of a special class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.153" offset="7744589">We submit that, with respect for Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, both of those factors are present and if they indicate that there was no intent on the private part of Congress to include and imply private remedy to enforce the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.138" offset="7796521">In Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, Congress has devised a scheme entrusting to an expert federal administrative body the task of determining whether certain types of obstructions to navigable capacity are unreasonable types of obstructions and therefore, it should not be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.932" offset="7863708">That body of experts is the Secretary of War, later the Secretary of Army, and Chief of Engineers, and the Corps of Engineers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2022.459" offset="8181879">And Section 406 of the Act, which is the enforcement provision for Section 10, specifically provides for both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.738" offset="8210927">I might quote Court's attention to the fact that, of course, Section 406, where it says that courts will have jurisdiction to enjoin the removal of structures in the waters found illegal under Section 9 or 10, this Court in Republic Steel has construed that as much broader.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.179" offset="8296713">That is that the U.S. Attorney, when he is -- when he is seeking remedies against violations of the Act if it not in fact limited to the literal language of that -- of that sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.130" offset="8336524">And in making that judgment, the Court emphasized that the reason he is not limited to that is because Congress in this statute was securing the interest of the United States and in Section 17 of the Act they said, “The Department of Justice shall conduct these proceedings to enforce -- all necessary proceedings to enforce the provisions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.713" offset="8422832">And there was a very strong strain in Republic Steel case emphasizing that we have to have a broad remedy here because this is the interest of the United States that are being enforced with and that powers of Attorney General are brought to bear in these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.539" offset="8482183">And I don't think you can read from that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.074" offset="8496289">I sense that the broad types of equitable relief which might be sought by private parties are contained in the Act because Congress wanted private parties to have those powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.215" offset="8548847">Second, now, some of the courts in the Sierra Club say, well, Section 17 only concerns criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.234" offset="8576955">That's the only thing that the Department of Justice is the one to bring these criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.575" offset="8594300">But this means that the phrase, all proceedings necessary to enforce the Act doesn't include injunctive relief and that -- that just can't be true because injunctive relief is obviously quite critical to the enforcement of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.891" offset="8639544">And Section 17 says the Department of Justice shall control those proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2982.818" offset="12023342">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.876" offset="12035567">If I may, I would like to address first the question of the private right of the plaintiffs to bring this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.565" offset="12070258">And at the outset, I would like to emphasize that unlike the situation of the plaintiff in the Amtrak, the Touche Ross, the Cannon, and the Transamerica cases, we are not proposing that this Court tried to discern from the legislative language in intent to create a new and different private cause of action that did not exist before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.031" offset="12164194">We agree that the test here is legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.568" offset="12178300">And unlike the dilemma that we frequently find ourselves in, here, we are able to gauge legislative intent quite accurately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.792" offset="12211214">I think it's possible on this case to actually determine the state of mind of the Congressman who enacted the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1890, which was the predecessor of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 In which all counsel agree, I believe, is the relevant statute for determining the legislative intent behind the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.564" offset="12314241">Counsel has agreed and I think the federal defendants have acknowledged in their brief that the purpose of the Congress, when they enacted the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1890, was an effect to overrule a decision of this Court in Willamette Iron Bridge Company versus Hatch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.462" offset="12389892">For that reason, I think it instructed to go back to Willamette Iron Bridge versus Hatch and examine how that case would have been decided with the change that was brought by Congress when it enacted the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1890.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.189" offset="12452795">Now, Willamette Iron Bridge versus Hatch was a suit brought by a citizen of Oregon against another citizen of Oregon to obey the nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.140" offset="12492606">He relied upon what he asserted was a statute of the United States that rendered unlawful the construction of a bridge that obstructed navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.209" offset="12532834">He said, “That bridge is a nuisance because it obstructs navigation and it is made unlawful by an act of Congress.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3149.771" offset="12691136">So, he relied upon that statute which admitted Oregon into the union and contained some language that -- that recited that the Willamette River would be forever free for navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.457" offset="12733872">He said, the construction of that bridge obstructed navigation and it provided the necessary element of a private cause of action for nuisance, that is that the obstruction was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.796" offset="12783192">And this Court said to him, just as it had said in a string of very similar cases, decided in the 19th century in language that sounds like it was directed at Congress rather than to the private litigants, that you are right every step of the way with one exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.958" offset="12847871">There is no federal statute which makes the obstruction of a navigable waterway unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.293" offset="12881203">Now, that was the culmination of a series of cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3213.039" offset="12944210">And I believe that what Congress intended, quite clearly, from the enactment of that particular statute, was to put Mr. Hatch in the position where if that lawsuit had been brought after the enactment of that particular law, he would have prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.926" offset="13011711">He would have prevailed on the theory of a private nuisance.</text>

            <label>Mr. Roderick Eugene Walston</label>
            <text syncTime="4611.371" offset="18537549">Just for a briefing, Mr. Justice Brennan, the Sierra Club has stated that assuming that the Corps of Engineers has jurisdiction, the Corps should be allowed to deny the permit on any non-navigational grounds such as on any solely environmental grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4629.182" offset="18608707">I might point out to the Court that that position, although very consistent with the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case, is inconsistent with the position expressed by the United States in its own brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4640.548" offset="18654160">For page 31 of the United States brief, blissful sentence, the United States makes the following statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4646.498" offset="18677983">We assume, moreover, that an alteration or modification must be of a type with the potential for affecting navigation i.e. “that water quality alterations would not be covered unless they are of a type with the potential for reducing stream capacity, for example, by increasing saltation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4667.321" offset="18761262">Thus, the position of the Sierra Club and the United States on the merits of this case is apparently at odds according to their oral arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4675.335" offset="18793340">I further point out that according to the facts of the case, yes indeed, there are some effects in this case caused by the water exports upon Delta environmental quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4684.925" offset="18831688">Those effects largely related to salinity intrusion just as it has been pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4689.478" offset="18849974">The State Water Resources Control Board, in the process of issuing appropriate water right permits to the State Water Project, has essentially dealt with those kind of concerns and has worked out a finally tuned program to ameliorate or perhaps avoid those salinity intrusion problems altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="4706.385" offset="18917579">So, the State has performed a very active function and rule in the process of trying to determine the allocation of water between Northern and Central and Southern California needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4715.946" offset="18955822">And it is our view that the State's role should be maintained that the program developed by the State Water Resources Control Board should be upheld and that the Corps of Engineers should not have a power to overwrite it or veto it in the absence of some kind of discernable, substantial effect upon federal navigation interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4735.189" offset="19032726">And those, that kind of an effect simply doesn't exist here.</text>
