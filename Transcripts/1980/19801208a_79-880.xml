            <text syncTime="78.157" offset="456923">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="81.749" offset="471343">This case requires this Court for the first time in the history of the nation to determine the extent of the personal immunity of the President of the United Stales and his closest advisors for money damages arising from the claimed violation of constitutional rights resulting from the performance of his official duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.927" offset="564025">In Butz v. Economou, decided during the 1977 term, the Court held that although a qualified immunity from damages liability should be the general rule for executive officials charged with a violation of the Constitution, there are some officials whose special functions require a full exemption from such liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.964" offset="668201">We submit that the President of the United States, the constitutional head of the second branch of government, is preeminently such an official, and that officers carrying out his express directions should be protected by an immunity derivative of his.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.471" offset="746255">The facts in this case may be succinctly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.766" offset="763392">Between February and April, 1969, when the nation was engaged in armed conflict in Southeast Asia, the President and several of his top advisors were deeply concerned about unauthorized disclosures to the news media of confidential information, including foreign policy documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.460" offset="854193">The President feared that the unauthorized disclosure of this material would jeopardize the Government's foreign policy initiatives, and would seriously undermine the confidence of our allies in our reliability about classified disclosures to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.187" offset="933083">The nature of some of the unauthorized disclosures made the National Security Council a likely source of the security leaks.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.979" offset="972267">Accordingly, the President met with the Attorney General, the Director of the National Security Council, and the Director of the FBI, to discuss remedial measures.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.804" offset="1015525">Upon the advice of the FBI Director, that electronic surveillance would be a method of discovering the source of the leaks, the President authorized the use of wiretaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.141" offset="1068920">The FBI Director prepared a list of officials in the office of the National Security Council Advisor who had access to documents similar to those that were released, and who possessed other characteristics that suggested that they might be likely sources of the unauthorized disclosures.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.241" offset="1165259">This list included the name of Dr. Halperin, principal respondent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.317" offset="1193576">The Attorney General approved the installation of a tap on the residence phone of Dr. Halperin and that was accomplished in May, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.670" offset="1251045">Summaries of information obtained from this disclosure were prepared and disseminated, ultimately through the Assistant to the President, Mr. Haldeman, another one of the petitioners, who would bring pertinent data to the attention of the President and to the Director of the National Security Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.803" offset="1335578">The tap failed to reveal that Dr. Halperin was the source of the leaks, and it was removed from the telephone on his residence in February, 1971.</text>

            <text syncTime="337.818" offset="1495656">Petitioners, other federal defendants, and the telephone company were named as defendants and monetary damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, were sought.</text>

            <text syncTime="524.384" offset="2241922">The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.913" offset="2268045">It held, first, that the Fourth Amendment requirement of a warrant for electronic surveillance... and there was none here... in national security cases would be applied retroactively to establish a cause of action in damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.408" offset="2325932">It also concluded that petitioners' failure to terminate the tap within a reasonable time also gave rise to a damages action for violation of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.497" offset="2374311">It also concluded that petitioners are not entitled to an absolute immunity from damages nor to a qualified immunity as a matter of law with respect to the continuance of the taps, because there were no reasonable grounds for believing that the surveillance was in accord with the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.082" offset="2456649">It remanded to the district court to determine when the continuation of the wiretap became unreasonable, and whether petitioners acted in good faith in authorizing a warrantless electronic interception for national security purposes prior to this Court's decision in United States v. United States District Court, a case that's known as the Keith case.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.336" offset="2557690">It held that respondents could be awarded damages for emotional distress and for other intangible injuries, and it reversed the award of summary judgment in favor of Dr. Kissinger and remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.784" offset="2619444">Now, at the outset, we contend that to subject the President of the United States to personal damages for official acts in his capacity as the nation's chief executive is contrary to compelling reasons of public policy as well as to the design of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.995" offset="2700319">We submit that absolute immunity is absolutely necessary to protect the decision-making processes of the President in his conduct of the official business.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.989" offset="2748280">The risk of personal liability would inhibit the fearless and decisive exercise of presidential authority which the nation has a right to expect.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.361" offset="2789762">Just as a judge, who this Court has determined enjoys absolute immunity, must make decisions in controversies fraught with passion, and so must Presidents often make discretionary decisions about controversial issues that affect the lives of virtually every American, especially in areas of national defense and foreign affairs which are involved in this litigation, the President's discharge of these duties should be motivated solely by his concern for the good of the nation, and not at all by the fear of damages awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.986" offset="2952244">And these fears, we submit, are not de minimis.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.938" offset="2968126">In Butz v. Economou, the ad damnum was $32 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.279" offset="2993413">It is manifest, we submit, that a qualified immunity is inadequate to protect the public interest in the vigorous and fearless performance of a president's constitutional duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.259" offset="3045344">The skillful pleader can easily avoid a motion to dismiss by alleging malice, bad faith, and unreasonableness, and impose on the President the burden of the time, the expense, the personal anxiety, and the inevitable distraction of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.235" offset="3129250">Judge Gesell, the only district judge who was a member of the appellate panel in this case, directed our attention to what he called the increasing frequency by which plaintiffs are</text>
            <text syncTime="759.761" offset="3183375">"filing suits seeking damage awards against high government officials in their personal capacities, based on alleged constitutional torts. "</text>
            <text syncTime="769.927" offset="3224022">And he expressed grave doubts whether the usual tests apply to determine the existence of genuine issues of controverted fact would afford any protection to a president from extensive discovery delving into his innermost thoughts and probing his mind to determine whether and how he acted in his official capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.215" offset="3325168">We submit that in a subsequent matter, as we point out in Footnote 34 on page 37 of our brief, that this Court's expectation in Butz, that</text>

Hampton, which has been characterized as the longest jury trial in the history of United States courts, and must go back again for several months of trial to determine whether a qualified immunity which was given to the federal defendants in that case was available to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.066" offset="3556613">We next contend that absolute presidential immunity should extend to officials who acted at his direct and express direction to carry out his authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.451" offset="3610112">It is obvious that a president can only act per alios and if his alter egos do not enjoy the same absolute immunity which we submit he should receive, then the public interest in his fearless discharge of his constitutional duties will be utterly frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.894" offset="3699868">We also contend that an absolute immunity for damages should attach to the giving of advice to the President pursuant to Article II, Section 2, of the United States Constitution by the heads of his departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.904" offset="3763921">The fear of personal liability on the part of a department head who is asked to render advice to the President would deprive the chief executive officer of exactly what the Constitution intended for him to receive, the best judgment, the honest, frank and considered opinion of his subordinate.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.693" offset="3847094">However, in this case, to deny absolute immunity would dry up the source of the kind of advice that would be necessary for the discharge of the public's business.</text>

            <text syncTime="1349.631" offset="5542859">Qualified immunity occurs, as we understand it, when two elements are satisfied: first, there must be the absence of malice or bad faith; and second, there must be an objective test that the conduct is reasonable, that there was no settled or clearly established law relating to the alleged violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.761" offset="5651424">Now, the Court here did not hold that there was malice or bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.945" offset="5688100">The Court instead claimed that there was clear established law violated which we contend, and we believe we demonstrate in our brief, is erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.956" offset="5740136">We submit that in 1969 when these taps were established, it was far from being clear and established what the requirement was, either for warrants or reasonableness in national security wiretaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.447" offset="5810144">As a matter of fact, it was only two years before these wiretaps were initiated that this Court first held that electronic surveillance was covered by the Fourth Amendment, and the first case to impose a warrant requirement for electronic surveillance of this sort was the so-called Keith case which was decided after the taps were terminated here, and that concerned surveillance for domestic security, and not foreign national security surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.089" offset="5960714">And it wasn't until after that that any court first spoke to the question of the application of the Fourth Amendment to the national service surveillance for foreign security purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.317" offset="6025602">And as this Court itself said in the Keith case, it was addressing a matter which had never been addressed before by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.297" offset="6065517">And we believe that in the light of this demonstration, for the court below to have said that this was in violation of settled or clearly established law is highly erroneous, that it is erroneous as a matter of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1547.146" offset="6332907">--That's correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.912" offset="6340012">And we submit that in the field of the area of national security, it may not be appropriate to take the test of reasonableness from criminal cases, and apply it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.858" offset="6395810">For example, I say it without knowing this to be the fact, but I believe that there is a basis for it, that we may be conducting national security wiretaps that have had several years' duration, in some areas; and it may be reasonable in the context of foreign surveillance for national security reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.209" offset="6493194">Whereas to conduct surveillance for a criminal law purpose of a domestic person, might be unreasonable if it's more than a matter of a few days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.155" offset="6540946">And so we submit that this is an evolving area of the law, and that it certainly isn't settled or clearly established law, and that the court below erred in asserting that it was, in denying even a qualified immunity, which it would have in the absence of malice, and in the absence of bad faith, in the absence of violation of clearly established law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.770" offset="6643450">We also suggest that, as Butz v. Economou suggested, the Doctrine of Qualified Immunity is not rigid, it's also an evolving doctrine, being a court-made doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.686" offset="6703114">And that it varies with the scope of discretion and responsibility of the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.496" offset="6726311">And although the form it took in Butz v. Economou was a bad faith, the existence of bad faith or the violation of settled or clearly established law, we suggest that for the President and his closest advisors, a much more useful formulation of qualified immunity would eliminate the subjective element of bad faith or malice, and hold only the objective test of a violation of settled or clearly established law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.120" offset="6884822">And we suggest this for the following reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.947" offset="6896107">This would permit a court to determine the question of damages liability as a matter of law, and make unnecessary the deposing of the President and his closest aides, the submission to them of interrogatories to answer, and possibly the necessity of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.939" offset="6976146">And still it would afford protection, because any violation of settled or clearly established law which could be determined objectively would curb the kinds of excesses that this Court should be concerned about in balancing the right of the citizen to recompense against the interest of the entire nation in the conduct of the office of the President, which we submit is seriously undermined by either the absence of an absolute immunity or the failure to construct the kind of qualified immunity that he might have, which could be determined as a matter of law rather than as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.515" offset="7162451">Finally, we argue that judicial decisions establishing constitutional standards for national security surveillance which were announced after the Halperin wiretap should not be applied retroactively to permit an award of personal damages for federal officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.491" offset="7246356">Clearly, those decisions are all subsequent to the termination of the tap on Dr. Halperin's phone, and yet the Court of Appeals applied them retroactively, mistakenly, we believe, under the standards expressed in Chevron.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.577" offset="7318663">The standards in Chevron were three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.451" offset="7334128">The first was whether the new rule was foreshadowed by existing law, or whether it established an overruling of a longstanding precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.289" offset="7397449">And we suggest that this Court's opening language in the Keith case indicates that this certainly is not an area that was foreshadowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.954" offset="7452201">We also suggest that the second test in Chevron is whether it serves the purpose of the new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.654" offset="7486996">The purpose of the new rule, as we understand it, is to deter conduct, and this Court has said many times... in Linkletter, for example that conduct that has already occurred is not deterred by imposing personal liability after the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.631" offset="7566827">And the third standard is whether the retroactive application would be unfair, and we submit it would be eminently unfair because the entire genius of our legal system is not to hold a person to a standard genius of conduct of which he had no notice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1959.010" offset="7980397">I'd like to say a word more about the facts of this case against which petitioners' legal argument must be measured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.696" offset="8011117">To begin with Petitioner Kissinger, our case against him is not based on any advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.614" offset="8038807">Indeed, our case against any of the petitioners is not based on the giving of advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.472" offset="8054272">In fact I'd be hard pressed to frame a complaint under Bivens that was based on the giving of advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.907" offset="8083947">Our case against Petitioner Kissinger is based on his role in selecting Morton Halperin as a surveillance target.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.341" offset="8109756">I believe the Solicitor General misspoke when he said that FBI Director Hoover assembled the list of wiretap targets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.136" offset="8140894">In fact, the list was assembled by Dr. Kissinger at the National Security Council, that put Halperin on the list to be wiretapped.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.334" offset="8173703">He put Halperin on the list to be wiretapped despite the fact that Dr. Kissinger knew that Halperin did not have access to the information related to the B-52 bombing story, which was the leak that triggered the wiretaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.859" offset="8235770">And in fact, Dr. Kissinger also knew that Mr. Halperin had very little access to the information which appeared in previous leaks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.855" offset="8275790">In fact, when Dr. Kissinger asked his aide, General Haig, to prepare a list of people who had access to the B-52 bombing story, Haig did not put Halperin's name on the list, but instead, at Kissinger's direction, Halperin's name was put on the list and it was transmitted over to the FBI.</text>

Economou, the first of all is the importance of enabling a citizen to recover for the violation of his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.889" offset="12003881">Secondly is the interest in deterring officials from undertaking actions which violate the constitutional rights of citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.322" offset="12049648">And in Butz the Court stressed that the higher an executive official is, the greater his power and the greater his capacity to inflict harm, and therefore the need for deterrence is correspondingly great.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.300" offset="12105550">We submit that under that analysis that the deterring interest is at its peak when you're dealing with the President, because he of course is the chief executive officer with the greatest degree of wherewithal to inflict harm on people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.248" offset="12169289">And third, and most fundamentally, the principle that in this country no man is above the law, and all executive officers should have to face suit if in fact they clearly have engaged in a violation of constitutional rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="3034.814" offset="12283601">But the policy justification for that is much different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.780" offset="12307424">As the Court said in Butz, the cluster of immunities that attach to participants in the judicial process arises from the nature of the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.886" offset="12347862">It's open, it's adversarial, and above all, errors are generally correctable on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.931" offset="12368028">And therefore the balance has been struck in favor of absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.039" offset="12388508">When you're dealing with the executive branch, frequently the actions are not open, and when you're dealing with violations of constitutional rights, there is no appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3166.809" offset="12811587">In fact, there's a case in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, Halkin v. Helms, 598 F. 2d 1, where that precise result obtained, and I was involved in it and unhappily lost.</text>

            <text syncTime="3179.038" offset="12860489">So those interests will be protected, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.865" offset="12879819">The principal countervailing interest which the government identifies to argue against the qualified immunity, is the inhibition on the President's time that defending such suits will occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.964" offset="12976159">Bearing in mind... and it has to be borne foremost in mind, the President enjoys the greatest degree of protection of any official under the qualified immunity doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.709" offset="13023179">The qualified immunity doctrine, as was spelled out in Scheuer v. Rhodes, which in fact involved the chief executive officer of a state... which while not obviously on all fours is similar to the situation... very clearly spelled out the principles that the greater an official's responsibilities, the wider the scope of his discretion, the greater the exigencies under which he must make decisions, the greater his opportunity to prevail under qualified immunity will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.243" offset="13145328">And for that reason we think that the President is likely to escape suits in all situations except where it is shown that he is directly and personally involved on a continuing basis in the violation of constitutional rights, such as is demonstrated in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3440.120" offset="13904864">One of the other interests that the Government has identified as militating in favor of an absolute immunity is the artfulness, or the danger of artful pleading, and the fact that the President will be ensnared in insubstantial lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.188" offset="14001099">Again, this is, the empirical evidence does not support this argument, and in this case we have very solid evidence to support our claims, and I think it's worth noting that Judge Gesell in his concurrence proposed a higher standard for a plaintiff's overcoming summary judgment, while he advocated that higher standard he certainly didn't suggest that we hadn't met it in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.349" offset="14105694">The courts in our view have such, the district courts have such great discretion in the timing and scheduling of suits that they can use their ingenuity and the flexibility that's vested in them under the Federal Rules to make accommodations for the President's time, so that if you get one of these situations where the President is deeply involved in a clear violation of constitutional rights and it is necessary to procure his evidence, that can be done with a minimum of imposition on his time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.212" offset="14229201">If contrary to our submission the Court decides that absolute immunity is appropriate for the President, we of course urge the Court to reject the contention that the petitioners Kissinger, Mitchell, and Haldeman enjoyed derivative immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.864" offset="14283849">If the Court were to accept this doctrine it would substantially erode the system of deterrence that the Court has sought to foster in Butz.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.250" offset="14317390">In other words, if the President is free to violate constitutional rights with impunity, it's essential and absolutely important that his associates be constrained from doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.106" offset="14356783">I think, unless the Court has further questions, I don't have anything further I need to say.</text>
