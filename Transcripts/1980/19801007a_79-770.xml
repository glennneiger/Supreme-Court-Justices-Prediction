            <text syncTime="88.497" offset="510455">This case is here on the Government's petition to review two decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.462" offset="538354">At issue in this case is the scope of the variance clause promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency with regard to the so-called 1977 effluent limitations required by the Clean Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.253" offset="589554">At the outset I'd like to emphasize that there is no question in this case about the reasonableness or practicability or validity of any technical or substantive regulation promulgated by EPA.</text>

            <text syncTime="122.919" offset="648172">The court below concluded in both cases that the variance clause promulgated by EPA is invalid because EPA refuses to consider the inability of an individual discharger to afford compliance with the '77 limitations as a basis for granting a variance.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.615" offset="730928">Those decisions are in square conflict with the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in the Weyerhaeuser case.</text>

            <text syncTime="186.100" offset="900933">Section 301(b) directs the Administrator to promulgate two sets of increasingly stringent effluent limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.236" offset="941475">Those are the so-called 1977 and 1987 effluent limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.579" offset="958821">The Court recognized in dupont, or held in dupont, that the regulations are to be promulgated on an industry-by-industry basis or category-by-category basis, and not on a plant-by-plant basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.353" offset="1025903">And the language and legislative history of the Act shows that the difference in the stringency between the regulations is approximated by that the '77 limitations are to approximate if appropriate the average of the best performers in the various subcategories of an industry; whereas the 1987 regulations are to be based on the best performer in an industry with an eye, if possible, to eliminating discharges altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.543" offset="1146693">So, as I said, Section 301 requires the promulgation of these two sets of industry-wide effluent limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.353" offset="1177936">Section 304(b) in turn sets forth factors that EPA must consider in promulgating the industry-wide effluent limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.833" offset="1219836">As to both the '77 and '87 limitations, Section 304(b) requires that EPA consider such factors as the differences between plants, the ages of plants, the technologies used in those plants, processes, and other similar factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.780" offset="1287650">And in both cases and most pertinent to this case, EPA must take into account the cost of application.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.855" offset="1315967">And there's no dispute in this case that in setting the industry-wide regulations in the crushed stone, sand and gravel, and coal industries, which are before this Court, that EPA did take into account quite extensively the costs, total costs, of application.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.427" offset="1378243">The extensive administrative proceedings leading up to the promulgation of the regulations contain several reports by independent analysts regarding the various industries, and this is the procedure that EPA follows in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.092" offset="1444907">These ensure that no effluent limitations promulgated by EPA will substantially undermine an industry or in any way shut down an industry in toto or any substantial part.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.117" offset="1496943">For example, in the crushed stone industry and sand and gravel industry combined, EPA considered that the total cost of the 1977 limitations would be approximately $21 million, and there are 10,000 dischargers in these combined industries.</text>

            <text syncTime="361.701" offset="1603314">And there are 10,000 of those in the two combined, crushed stone and sand and gravel, approximately, and the estimate was that the total cost to those 10,000 different firms would be about $20 million, and that this would have an effect on the price of the product that they sell somewhere between 2 and 8 percent, at most.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.600" offset="1678860">And further, EPA goes even further than just estimating the total impact and total cost to the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.644" offset="1703101">It also estimates how many marginal firms may be forced to close because they cannot afford compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.486" offset="1734448">As I indicated before, there are about 4,800 crushed stone facilities and EPA estimated that at most 35 marginal firms would be forced to close because they could not afford to comply or otherwise would not want to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.201" offset="1789306">And these are all very small firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.496" offset="1798501">The EPA also estimated, with regard to the sand and gravel industry, for example, that only 26 out of the more than 5,000 dischargers might be forced to close as a result of the effluent limitation.</text>

            <text syncTime="427.036" offset="1864643">Now, that indicates that EPA takes very seriously the requirement that it take into account total cost when it sets the initial industry-wide regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.001" offset="1908528">In fact, the proceedings in these cases show that EPA rejected various requests by environmental groups and others to regulate other kinds of pollutants than those it chose eventually to regulate because they were prohibitively expensive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1290.747" offset="5319493">That is conceivable although I'd like to point out two things, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.807" offset="5339764">First, Congress anticipated at a minimum that the imposition of the 1977 effluent limitations will require as many as 300 major firms employing up to 125,000 people to be put out of business because they couldn't afford or did not wish to afford compliance with the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.456" offset="5410295">So that's Congress's judgment that the clean waters of this nation are more important than some of those marginal firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.532" offset="5438612">And the second point is that in the facts of this case I believe that all the firms that EPA anticipated would be forced out of business were in fact smaller firms and I take it that they were in such positions and so penurious that they could afford even with a Section 8 loan or didn't wish to try under a Section 8 loan to afford to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.318" offset="5541743">The respondents rely on section 304(b)(1)(B) as the basis for their argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.471" offset="5578419">They say, the statute requires EPA to take into account total cost; we agree, on the industry-wide level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.702" offset="5615304">And that under our own version of the variance, we have to retake into account and reconsider every single factor on the variance level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.354" offset="5649890">And therefore we are trapped in our own language and we must therefore grant these economic variances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.086" offset="5672878">Well, there are several problems with that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.336" offset="5681864">First, both the '77 and '87 limitations, actually Section 304(b)(1)(B) and (b)(2)(B) require EPA to take into account "cost of application".</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.971" offset="5732332">If the words "cost of application" meant,</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.862" offset="5739960">"and you must reconsider on the variance level. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.876" offset="5748006">there would have been no need for Congress to expressly create this Section 301(c) variance, which it did create and which it created only with regard to the '87 limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.449" offset="5794295">The second problem is that respondents have misconstrued EPA's variance clause and a well-stated and firm position all along.</text>

            <text syncTime="1454.821" offset="5975794">But they went ahead and created a specific variance based on the affordability factor and put a limitation on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.475" offset="5998364">But that limitation further emphasizes the correctness of EPA's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.052" offset="6016754">Congress obviously intended the '77 effluent limitations to be a uniform floor and '87 was a hope to clean up the waters even further, but there was a realization that those were more stringent regulations and that some businesses who were doing a good job insofar as they had already complied with the '77 limitations might not be able to take the next step further, only part of that step.</text>

            <text syncTime="1807.164" offset="7385152">As Mr. Justice Stevens observed, there is no express authority in 301 for EPA to issue 1977 regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.176" offset="7425172">That's what dupont was all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.487" offset="7434471">What dupont said was, you have to look at the structure of the Act as a whole to derive implied authority for EPA to issue those '77 regulations in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.231" offset="7489433">And what the 4th Circuit said and what you affirmed in dupont was that that implied authority was conditioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.259" offset="7517541">It was conditioned two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.399" offset="7530079">First, those '77 regulations were only presumptively applicable at the permit-issuing stage, and as this Court characterized it, saying the same thing, therefore you have to have a meaningful variance clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.252" offset="7593505">And the logic of dupont is, and the logic of the Government's brief in the recent Appalachian Power case, which I just argued against them, is that a variance clause proceeding under 1977 regulations is not a true variance at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.572" offset="7662781">What it does is it shifts the burden and permits the plant owner to come in and produce evidence under all of the statutory criteria of 304(b)(1)(B) that was relevant to the setting of those presumptively applicable nationwide effluent limitations for '77, and if he can show by evidence under those criteria that BPT for his own particular plant is a different limitation, then he doesn't get a variance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.183" offset="7805201">This is for case-by-case adjustment of BPT.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.041" offset="7816695">That's in the Government's first brief in this case--</text>

            <text syncTime="2581.813" offset="10483797">They both reached the same conclusion that evidence of affordability was relevant to total cost, that component in the cost/benefit test that's in 304(b)(1)(B).</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.697" offset="10539281">The 4th Circuit following... you remember, it started this whole thing with dupont... and it looked mainly in dupont not to legislative history but to the overall scheme of the Act to see whether EPA had this implied authority to issue the regulations in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.346" offset="10617857">It started in Appalachian; two months after it decided dupont it picked up right where it was and said, looking at the overall scheme of the Act as a whole, we think the concept of affordability... that is, evidence of affordability... clearly ought to be admissible under total cost because otherwise you would have the anomalous situation of being able to get away to have it considered under the more stringent limitation without having it taken into account under '77.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.564" offset="10766755">We think that the reference in the 4th Circuit opinions in Appalachian has to be viewed in that context, that is, its reference to 301(c) said that evidence of affordability has to be considered under the statutory criteria language of total cost in relation to resulting effluent benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.088" offset="10856826">And it's clear to us that Weyerhaeuser reached that point a different way, because it had benefit of your decision in dupont and the benefit of EPA's shift in its interpretation of the regulations to permit the consideration of economic evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.329" offset="10937805">So it simply took the shorthand route and looked at legislative history with regard to total cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="2722.864" offset="11047937">Should the Court try to decide this kind of issue on abstractions as distinguished from a case in which, a specific case in which evidence were tendered that 350 out of 500 people in a particular town would be unemployed because of the closure of a coal mine, rather than trying to pass on the regulations in the abstract?</text>

            <text syncTime="2756.913" offset="11184192">It is true that the variance clause as it was contained in the regulations before the 4th Circuit had a certain amount of vagueness to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.346" offset="11225884">It talked about fundamentally different factors without indicating what those were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.126" offset="11241035">And indeed, when we argued the case in the 4th Circuit, one of the problems that we had with the variance clause is that it was vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.984" offset="11276457">You couldn't tell what the grounds were for the granting of a BPT variance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.700" offset="11295265">Now, with respect to the ripeness question, I think that that problem has been solved because EPA in 1979 published regulations under its MPDS program applicable to all industries and specifying in detail what factors will and will not be considered in granting a variance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.347" offset="11381887">You can look at 40 CFR, Section 125.31, and in particular Section 31(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.547" offset="11418667">In that provision of EPA's regulations, which are binding on the agency and express its position, state unequivocally that the inability of a particular plant to afford costs of compliance will not be grounds for a variance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3179.364" offset="12874001">Yet the one issue that they... as we understand it... refuse to consider in current permits is the question of whether or not the discharger can pay for the required control equipment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3238.591" offset="13110879">And I think that EPA's position here is at odds with that tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.088" offset="13124881">It's inconceivable to me that Contress would have delegated to EPA the authority to shut down a plant without a hearing at least on this issue, not in cases where they are in clear violation of that law, not in a situation where a plant is endangering human health, but simply because a small businessman cannot obtain financing or otherwise afford the cost involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.470" offset="13226341">Now, there's been a lot said about the statutory structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.281" offset="13245671">I'd like to simply make a couple of points regarding that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.857" offset="13259882">The 1977 standard is supposed to be practicable and in turn the Agency notes that it's not anticipated that large numbers of plants will be forced to close as a result of BPT.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.461" offset="13318292">In contrast, by 1984, the standards are supposed to be more stringent and reflect the best available technology economically achievable, and to ensure that firms will not be forced to close.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.815" offset="13367715">Congress provided in Section 301(c) for an explicit variance from the 1984, or the Government refers to them as the 1987 limits on grounds of affordability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.186" offset="13409198">Now there are two key respects in which the regulations depart from this scheme and in turn those departures relate to two independent grounds for affirming the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.292" offset="13453710">First of all, EPA's initial BPT regulations often go very far beyond what is practicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.944" offset="13484221">In the case of the crushed stone industry, for example, EPA adopted BPT regulations that require zero discharge of process water, and they publish the identical regulations planned for the 1984 standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.736" offset="13539392">Now, contrary to the Government's suggestion that the regulations were upheld in all respects, certainly the 4th Circuit found that in major respects the crushed stone regulations were unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.919" offset="13584218">The crushed stone industry contains hundreds of small privately owned businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.041" offset="13608669">And EPA's regulations would close many plants that cannot afford the costs involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.477" offset="13630403">We strenuously disagree with Government counsel that the costs were fully considered by the Agency or that the impact would be small.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.974" offset="13668437">And on that, I would point out a couple of factors since it's been brought up as an issue this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.845" offset="13695918">The Agency acknowledges that the greatest impact of its regulations will fall on small plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.576" offset="13726847">Indeed, the Agency predicted that there would be 35 closures within its small plant category.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.839" offset="13759866">Its economic analysis had several categories of plants, the smallest of which was the so-called small plant category, and this consisted of a 100,000 ton-per-year plant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3444.446" offset="13934259">In other words, this is a category of plants that was never studied by EPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.068" offset="13952754">We believe that many small plants in this industry will have a financial position that is significantly different from that studied by the Agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="3530.614" offset="14278971">--Not as such, although the issue is going to surface in one proceeding or the other, which was getting to my second point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.939" offset="14320244">There is a relationship here, an interrelationship between the setting of the national standards and the allowance of a variance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.420" offset="14350128">The courts have in many cases upheld national regulations considering EPA's data base and the way in which EPA evaluated the evidence on the grounds that, well, maybe this was less than perfect, but in situations where it isn't perfect, where there might be a taking or there might be a problem of insufficient consideration for statutory factors, that'll be accounted for in the variance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.394" offset="14450021">The implications of EPA's positions, it seems to me, are going to be to put an enormous burden on the initial regulation-setting stage, because if companies realize that the possibility of a variance is really illusory, that EPA has to have done superb economic analysis in the first instance, otherwise they're never going to be heard on the question of affordability, you're going to have extensive litigation and rule-making proceedings on the extent to which EPA conducted an adequate economic analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.911" offset="14580110">It seems to us that at some stage these issues must be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.066" offset="14600799">Now, the Agency's justification apparently is that since the statute allows for a variance and for BAT in 1984, and it's silent for BPT as to 1977, that that's dispositive on the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.401" offset="14674151">We submit that Congress would not have intended such a result and that the decision of the 4th Circuit should be upheld.</text>

            <text syncTime="3643.615" offset="14730994">Before I do that I'd like to make one point, if I might, Mr. Chief Justice, or two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.144" offset="14749070">The first point is that nothing in their brief... at least I read it several times, and I could find nothing about any constitutional question, any delegation question; this is simply a matter of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.173" offset="14785224">The second point is, as this Court made very clear in the dupont opinion, under the Clean Water Act the question is not what we think is an appropriate way to regulate; it is what Congress said and what Congress did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.575" offset="14838827">And here the language of the Act, although somewhat complicated, strongly supports EPA's position and the legislative history, which has not been discussed here at all, is simply overwhelming.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.303" offset="14881668">The report, the conference report... Senator Muskie, who was quoted with approval in this Court's dupont opinion at page 130 and page 129, and other consistent statements by Congressmen over and over and over again reflect three things, one, that these regulations would force certain marginal economically inefficient companies out of business; two, that in order to sort of appease that problem to some extent, Congress created Section 8 financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.118" offset="15028999">Senator Nelson introduced that bill saying variances are a problem because... and it's exactly the situation where you have a little fellow who's going to go out of work and it's very sympathetic, that it's hard to deny him a variance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.253" offset="15069541">Nonetheless, Congress made a determination that he would be denied a variance unless he could get the Section 8 funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.423" offset="15094200">And three, over and over and over again... and I direct the Court's attention to page 7 and 8 of the reply brief in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.389" offset="15122099">There's just statement after statement that the economic affordability will not be reconsidered on a plant-by-plant basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="3760.946" offset="15200257">And even as to that, I think it is indicative of the weakness of their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.458" offset="15222305">They claim that in 1977 when Congress amended the Act that it thoroughly considered and approved and acquiesced in the 4th Circuit Appalachian Power decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.470" offset="15258354">Now, the basis of that claim is three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.610" offset="15270892">First, the Congress didn't expressly disapprove it in 1977, so we have this legislative silence which is supposed to be dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.981" offset="15300463">Second, that a Congressman got up on the floor of the House and waved a 126-page Library of Congress report which indexes 144 reported decisions, including the Appalachian Power decision and including decisions that suggested that the variance clause was valid on the same page, and said that this report he found it very useful to understand the Act, saying nothing about the Appalachian Power decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.316" offset="15389802">And on the basis of this we are supposed to assume that Congress was aware of and acquiesced in this decision.</text>
