            <text syncTime="92.343" offset="515036">That provision states, and I quote from page 2 of our opening brief, the blue brief:</text>
            <text syncTime="99.847" offset="545025">"Suits for violations of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in the Act or between any such labor organizations may be brought in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties, without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.

            <text syncTime="157.035" offset="773753">One court of appeals, the 10th, has taken the opposite view, and six other courts of appeals have taken the view that the jurisdictional question depends on whether the actions affect labor management relations and have stated that test in widely varying ways.</text>

            <text syncTime="218.775" offset="1020663">We do not believe that the better view is that the parties by their pleadings or the courts by going though a factual inquiry should be deciding this matter on a case by case basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="841.843" offset="3512953">If I can backtrack just very briefly to the facts, this case concerns an effort by the international union to merge local unions in an area of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.570" offset="3591843">The international union proceeded as provided under the international constitution, an order of consolidation was promulgated, a hearing was held, in which the affected unions could state their views, a hearing officer's decision was issued, it was reviewed by the international president and by the general executive board and finally promulgated.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.257" offset="3706677">At that point one of the local unions affected by the proposed merger went into state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.881" offset="3749100">There was a complaint and an amended complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.035" offset="3773760">The amended complaint, which is on page, begins on page 54 of the Appendix, states among other points that the defendant is an international labor organization consisting of many locals in New Jersey and elsewhere throughout the United States and Canada, and that the relationship... rights and duties... between Local 334 and the international is governed by the said constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.106" offset="3910014">The gravamen of the first count was that the actions of the general president do not constitute a consolidation of local unions within the meaning of the constitution and therefore the order insofar as it applies to plaintiff is illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.920" offset="3989322">Plainly from what I have said, the issue and the primary issue between the parties was the meaning of Section 86 of the national constitution which is set out at page 25 of the record and provides for the merger of local unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.468" offset="4087438">Our basic position is that national constitutions insofar as they determine the relationship between the national and locals, and between locals inter se, are contracts between labor organizations representing employees in an industry affecting commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.067" offset="4177926">We are proceeding in this instance without secondary guidance aside from the words of the statute to which I have already referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.974" offset="4229544">The second clause, the clause on contracts between labor organizations, was added in conference and the conferees did not explain their intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.448" offset="4283356">In that instance we believe, in such an instance we believe that the proper approach is to consult the ordinary contemporaneous meaning of the terms, and as we show at some length on our brief, both as a matter of federal law under the current, leading Coronado case of this Court by Mr. Chief Justice Taft and uniformly, so far as we can tell, under state law, constitutions have been regarded as contracts in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.375" offset="4451063">After all, they are agreements, serious agreements, which the parties intend to define their relationship and the courts have recognized them as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.718" offset="4508532">We think, too, that the reading we suggest is in accord with the basic purpose of Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.192" offset="4554403">As I have already stated, Congress was concerned about the difficulties of bringing suit against unions as unincorporated associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.856" offset="4633084">Congress didn't overestimate that difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.307" offset="4646876">The Senate report and the House report are very careful compilations of the diversity in state law on the question of how to sue an unincorporated association, when you can get jurisdiction, when you can't, what the prerequisites are, and the difficulties of obtaining relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.336" offset="4718974">The purpose of Section 301 is to end those difficulties and to provide in Congress's terms a high level of responsibility between labor organizations and employers when they enter into agreements, and obviously between labor organizations because that is what the language says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.284" offset="4810716">I think, too, that the evolution of the section, the fact the Congress completed its work in the House and the Senate and went to conference and said, this section is incomplete as it stands because it only covers contracts between employers and labor organizations, indicates that Congress must have been of the view that contracts between labor organizations ought to be enforceable in the same way as contracts between labor organizations and employers in order to accomplish the congressional end, and we think that in light of what Congress said and what it did that the language ought to be accorded its fair meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.567" offset="5011859">We think that this case is very much like Harrison v. PPG Industries in 446 U.S. where you had to grapple with a jurisdictional provision dealing with the scope of authority of the courts of appeals under, I believe it was, the Clean Water Act and the question was whether any other final action meant any other final action or only some final actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.224" offset="5150517">We think in this instance contracts means it is ordinarily, contracts between labor organizations means what that term would normally have meant to the people who drafted the section, who were well aware--</text>

            <text syncTime="2466.580" offset="10011905">It's clear that the impetus for Section 8(b) of the Act came from employers who were complaining to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.602" offset="10043983">There is no evidence that any member of a labor organization complained to Congress and said, I cannot enforce the provisions of my union constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.144" offset="10090168">And the reason that no individual member was complaining was because in at least 45 of the then-48 states and perhaps in 47 of the 48 states, individual union members had the right to sue either their union or the officers of their union who allegedly breached the union constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.961" offset="10193508">Now that right was not perfect, but it was effective, and a member who was illegally expelled from the union or disciplined by the union in violation of the union's constitution, had a right in the vast overwhelming majority of the states to sue to obtain reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.009" offset="10293609">There is no evidence that a local union officer complained to Congress and said, I can't get my international union to follow the dictates of its constitution, because under the law of associations or under the state law concerning property members of a labor organization and officers of the labor organization had the right to sue in state court to enforce the union constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.785" offset="10444702">That right has existed since the late 1800s.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.990" offset="10481587">The issue in Section 301, therefore, is what type of contracts between labor organizations presented the same problem which employers faced in Section 301 litigation under collective bargaining agreements?</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.721" offset="10560476">Because members always had the right to sue their union under the law of associations, the issue is then, which contracts between labor organizations involved entities which were not part of the same association?</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.134" offset="10642187">The labor organizations which are not part of the same association within the meaning of the state laws were a suit between one national union and another national union, a contract between two national unions involving no raid agreements, involving jurisdictional dispute mechanisms, involving the affiliation into a confederation such as the AFL CIO.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.285" offset="10754723">Those were the types of contracts which could not be litigated simply because the parties to the contracts were not part of the same association and did not have the right of recourse to state law under the law of associations which was prevalent in almost all of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.950" offset="10853361">If you accept the position of the United Association in this case this Court will be requiring the federalization of yet another area of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.129" offset="10914174">Now, in the first case in each of these areas of state law, it will be simple to say that we will apply the law of the state in which the problem arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.436" offset="10967360">But that law will then become federal law, and if the law in New Jersey regarding the disposition of the property of a local union is different from the law in New York, in the second case in New York you have a conflict between a law of the State of New York and federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3757.065" offset="15173910">In this time I'd like to try to cover four basic points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.652" offset="15204212">The central argument that has continuously been made by respondent in this case is that Section 301 does not cover contracts between related organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.378" offset="15255098">It would read the section to say, contracts between nonrelated organizations, even though that is not the word of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.984" offset="15289580">We think that that position which is based on the policy against regulating internal affairs, stated in the National Labor Relations Act, is wrong in principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.160" offset="15350289">First of all, as Section 301(a)'s first clause shows, the clause on collective bargaining and other contracts between employers and unions, Congress at the time passed Section 8(d) of the NLRA which says the Government can't control the substantive terms of bargaining, and passed Section 301 which says that the bargain reached by the employer and union is enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.898" offset="15485185">Obviously, Congress was not using the concept of regulation in the sense of enforcing an agreement between parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3845.456" offset="15527399">Indeed, we think that respondent overstates the policy against intervening in union affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3854.878" offset="15565120">As this Court said in the Boeing case, which is the most recent one in point and cited by respondent, and I'm quoting from 412 U.S. 73,</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.702" offset="15620395">"The reason for this determination not to reach certain fines was that Congress had not intended by enacting Section 8(b)(1)(A) to regulate the internal affairs of the unions to the extent that would be required in order to base unfair labor practice charges on the levying of such fines.

            <text syncTime="3920.437" offset="15827389">That is the second argument that respondent makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.808" offset="15852885">It is made for the first time on oral argument but it's never been contented before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.961" offset="15873469">We think it is contrary to the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.211" offset="15882455">The case respondent cited in its brief fittingly enough is from New Jersey, Harris v. Geier, and the language which we quote in our reply brief, the yellow brief, page 5, is that constitution and bylaws of the International Brotherhood constitute a contract between the members of Local 461 inter se and between them and the general body of membership of the brotherhood, and between the local and the joint council and other agencies of the brotherhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3971.520" offset="16031667">This suit is a suit by a local union seeking to keep its work and territorial jurisdiction and its charter from the UA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.542" offset="16067820">It's suit between two organizations about their relationship and in common sense and in the law it's a suit between labor organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3989.898" offset="16105227">Mr. Axelrod is quite right, and we agree, and we said we agreed, in our reply brief, that there are other suits based on union constitutions which concern the contract between the union and the member.</text>
            <text syncTime="4002.806" offset="16156845">If a union member complains about discipline, as the quotation I read indicates, he is suing on his contract with the union and under the plain language of Section 301(a) that suit is not covered any more than a suit by an individual against an employer based on a separate employment contract allowed by a collective agreement is a suit within Section 301.</text>

            <text syncTime="4101.219" offset="16550458">And sometimes you're suing on one and sometimes on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.773" offset="16568744">This happens to be the kind of suit that is within 301, and normal... every one of the examples that Mr. Axelrod gave of member suits is the kind which we think is basically on a contract between a member of the organization and not under 301.</text>

            <text syncTime="4175.870" offset="16849090">We think that that is the view.</text>
            <text syncTime="4179.571" offset="16863928">Let me just note that in Lincoln Mills the Court said that state law, if compatible with the purpose of Section 301, may be resorted to in order to find the rule that will best effectuate the federal policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4194.847" offset="16924950">That would seem to be that kind of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4196.966" offset="16933518">Alternatively, if there is going to be an effects test, we think it has to be in terms of classes of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4203.520" offset="16959745">Certainly a no raid agreement, a merger agreement, that determines who the collective bargaining representative is, is within the class of cases where you have an effect on labor relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4218.029" offset="17017737">If you don't have a class based test, then you're going to get into the point you raised originally where you're going to have a side trial, or else you're going to allow the plaintiff by his pleadings to determine whether federal law applies or state law applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4234.389" offset="17083147">So our basic position is, Congress has told us what it wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4238.193" offset="17098403">It has not used any modifiers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4241.312" offset="17110837">The situation is like Harrison v. PPG.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.364" offset="17123063">Our second position is that if an effect is necessary, it ought to be in terms of a class of cases and certainly what we have here, which determines who the collective bargaining representative is, who faces the employer, what the territorial and trade jurisdiction is within that effects test, whether or not the dispute is between related organizations or unrelated organizations.</text>
