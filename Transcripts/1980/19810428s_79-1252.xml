            <text syncTime="12.767" offset="143065">Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act statute which dates from 1899 forbids any obstructions to any of the navigable waters of the United States unless the obstruction is specifically approved by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.890" offset="223627">This action began when various private plaintiffs sought an injunction in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California claiming that Section 10 would be violated by various water storage and transportation projects that would be part of the California Water Project and that would serve to bring water from Northern California to the Central and Southern parts of the state.</text>
