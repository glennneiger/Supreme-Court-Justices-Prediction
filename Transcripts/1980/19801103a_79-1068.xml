            <label>Mr. Barry Sullivan</label>
            <text syncTime="61.805" offset="383635">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="65.108" offset="396906">This case is here on on certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.679" offset="423133">The question presented is a narrow but important question of statutory construction regarding Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.052" offset="464719">The question is whether Section 706(b) and 709(e) of Title VII which prohibit the Commission from disclosing investigatory information to the public prior to the filing of a suit prohibit disclosures of such information to persons immediately involved in Commission proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.102" offset="568896">This is a narrow question in two senses.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.506" offset="586450">First, the textual question is a narrow one, whether the words of the statute, "making public", includes persons who are immediately involved in administrative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.099" offset="648830">Secondly, in context, in Section 709(e) of the statute, it is clear that the prohibition on making public this information applies only to prelitigation disclosure, to disclosures that are made prior to the time that the Title VII action is brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.083" offset="756768">Therefore, the question is not whether disclosures of information may occur, even to the public, but the timing of those disclosures.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.324" offset="805774">The question is an important question for purposes of the administration of Title VII, because the answer to the question, whether the charging parties and attorneys and respondents and material witnesses are members of the public within the meaning of the statute will impact on the Commission's administration of the statute in investigation, conciliation, and reasonable cause determination, virtually at every stage of the Commission's processing of charges of employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.051" offset="968674">The facts of this case may be briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.337" offset="985810">In November, 1971, and continuing through June, 1973, seven charges of employment discrimination were filed with the Commission against the Joseph Horne Company, a Pittsburgh retailer, and the subsidiary of respondent, Associated Dry Goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.106" offset="1092912">These charges alleged discrimination... these charges were filed by seven women.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.760" offset="1123528">In six of the cases sex discrimination was charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.847" offset="1147874">In the seventh charge, which was also filed by a woman, racial discrimination was charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.120" offset="1180997">Three of the charges also charged retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.922" offset="1204194">In February, 1974, the Commission began its investigation by asking the Joseph Horne Company to produce certain evidence that the Commission thought relevant to these charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.800" offset="1271694">Basically, the evidence that was requested was information pertaining to the Company's personnel practices and employment files and other information relating to the departments of the employer in which these seven charging parties were employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.547" offset="1354659">Horne declined the Commission's request for this information on the ground that the Commission would not guarantee at that point that information thus collected would not be disclosed to charging parties or their attorneys or to witnesses during the course of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.697" offset="1459253">Thereafter, negotiations followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.518" offset="1482555">They were eventually unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.386" offset="1494048">The Commission in October, 1974, issued an administrative subpoena for purposes of acquiring much the same information.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.678" offset="1535217">In June, 1975, Associated brought this action in the Eastern District of Virginia, asserting that the Commission's disclosure policies violated Sections 706(b) and 709(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="365.770" offset="1599583">Subsequently the Commission brought an action itself to enforce its subpoena in the Western District of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.476" offset="1638349">The two suits were subsequently consolidated in the Eastern District of Virginia; the District Court enforced subpoena, but held that disclosure to the parties and to attorneys would do violence to the statutory scheme because it would affect conciliation and settlement, and therefore held that the parties were included within the public for purposes of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.662" offset="1755064">In October, 1979, the Court of Appeals affirmed by divided vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.684" offset="1791217">The question the Court of Appeals determined was whether disclosure to charging parties and attorneys prior to suit violates Section 706(b) and 709(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="426.511" offset="1842522">The Court held that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.630" offset="1854956">Judge Hall dissented in the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="445.472" offset="1918381">So that you don't really accurately state the question, that the question is a 709(e) question, not a 706(b) and 709(e) question.</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="457.197" offset="1965297">However, the text of the opinion of the Court of Appeals is quite clear in relying on both of the sections.</text>

            <label>Mr. Barry Sullivan</label>
            <text syncTime="470.957" offset="2020259">I think that would be correct although I don't think that the 4th Circuit was correct on either one.</text>

            <label>Justice Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="478.877" offset="2052024">You're talking about Judge Winters' opinion?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barry_sullivan" startTime="480.579" stopTime="907.073">
            <label>Mr. Barry Sullivan</label>
            <text syncTime="480.579" offset="2058816">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.696" offset="2063204">Judge Hall dissented noting that the decision of the majority was not based on statutory construction, but was based on policy ground, namely, the fear that disclosure to charging parties and their attorneys would contribute to litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.428" offset="2158186">The Judge also noted that the practical effect of the decision was to require charging parties to file lawsuits in order to determine whether their charges had any merit, and that the practical effect was simply to delay disclosure to the parties, not to deny disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.911" offset="2264138">I should also note, however, that in one respect Judge Hall did not agree with the Commission in that Judge Hall believed that disclosure of materials in related case files which the Commission believes is appropriate was not valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.146" offset="2365075">The decision of the 4th Circuit simply does not come to grips with the problem that's presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.822" offset="2431740">The Court of Appeals held that charging parties and attorneys were members of the public, but at the same time the Court found that certain disclosures could be made to the parties during the administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.252" offset="2509480">The Court of Appeals said that information could not be disseminated to the parties in haec verba but that the Commission could say to the parties, it has been reported that, or it has been said that, and then effectively convey the information that was contained in the file.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.117" offset="2608955">We believe that does not come to grips with the problem that's presented in this case because Section 709(e) prevents disclosure to the public in any manner whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.294" offset="2665693">The solution of the 4th Circuit, while it may be an appropriate solution in some respects, is not a solution to the problem of statutory construction that's presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.190" offset="2741239">The real question that has to be decided with respect to Section 709(e) and with respect to Section 706(b) is whether the phrase, "making public" is meant to include persons who are directly involved in the administrative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.640" offset="2835070">Moreover, we submit that the 4th Circuit's construction of the statute, the definition of "making public" which was accepted by the courts below, is erroneous in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.684" offset="2911244">Although 706(b) and 709(e) are read together as they must be, and in light of legislative history, that the prohibition of public disclosure means the prohibition of disclosing information to the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.704" offset="3027332">As Senator Humphrey said in the legislative debates, this is a ban on publicizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.958" offset="3056275">However, the meaning of the statute is even more clear when these provisions are read against the statute as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.332" offset="3101833">The Commission has the duty to investigate and to determine reasonable cause, and to attempt to settle disputes through informal means of conciliation, conference, and persuasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.442" offset="3162228">It would be impossible for the Commission to successfully and effectively undertake and complete these statutory duties if they could not disclose material to charging parties and to material witnesses when necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.005" offset="3244461">It is particularly obvious in the investigation stage when the Commission is presented with a charge of discrimination which it must attempt to investigate in order to determine whether reasonable cause exists to believe that a violation of the statute occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.989" offset="3344458">The respondent here asserts that nondisclosure to the parties would forward the investigation because respondents or employers would be more likely to come forward with information.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.319" offset="3429722">While that may be true, two points must be made: the Commission has compulsory process and can enforce its subpoenas in court, so essentially the respondent is saying that employers will come forward with the information that they're required by statutes to come forward with in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.054" offset="3532644">Secondly, even if the information were produced by employers more freely, the difficulty is that all of the information that they might provide simply would not advance the investigation if that material could not be tested during the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.787" offset="3639642">The investigation requires more than the receipt of one-sided information.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.625" offset="3666914">It requires the Commission to go out and try to verify that information and determine its truth.</text>

            <text syncTime="1050.785" offset="4339619">As you are aware, the Commission has the right to bring a civil complaint itself in meritorious cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.842" offset="4391864">And if the Commission had sufficient resources it could obviously bring a civil action in every case that was brought before it in which the charging parties' charge was deemed to have sufficient merit to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.791" offset="4475665">However, it can't do that because it doesn't have the administrative resources to do it, and therefore the Commission's enforcement of Title VII depends in large part on private actions being brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.352" offset="4549853">If an action were being brought by the Commission itself in a Title VII case, clearly the investigative files that were in its possession would be things that the Commission could use in framing the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="1190.658" offset="4899057">I think that it's important to understand that there are really two kinds of disclosures that go on during the course of the administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.749" offset="4939495">One is the kind of disclosure that goes on during conciliation or investigation, and those are by and large limited disclosures in which the Commission is trying to investigate and conciliate the charge, and in effect is filtering the information to the parties as it deems necessary to forward those goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.281" offset="5033640">However, the Commission also gives the charging party in effect a last clear chance in prelitigation disclosure to see what's in the case file in order to make a determined and reasoned decision as to whether to go forward with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.195" offset="5113261">And when the attorney who's representing the charging party at that point is able to make that determination, the Commission believes that the overall purposes of Title VII are well served, because the attorney is more likely to persuade the charging party at that point that a meritorious case isn't worth bringing, and also that a meritorious case is worth bringing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1554.673" offset="6355123">The Commission, though, seeks to avoid the ban by carving out a rather large exception for charging parties and others, saying that they are not members of the public, except that its own rules belie this intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.349" offset="6413846">First of all, the rules state who can see investigative files.</text>

            <text syncTime="1582.673" offset="6467136">But the charging party, and his lawyer if that may be the case, aren't the only ones who can see files.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.762" offset="6499528">Aggrieved persons can see their files.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.314" offset="6509768">Those filing on behalf of aggrieved persons can see the files.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.100" offset="6528889">Representatives of EEOC-funded groups, such as the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, can see the files for the purpose of referring cases to private counsel for litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.658" offset="6575074">Finally, the Commission argues that witnesses to Title VII proceedings may see the files.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.978" offset="6596390">What they can see, of course, further expands the scope of disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.032" offset="6616556">A charging party may see his own file, to be sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.650" offset="6627110">But he may also see related files.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.185" offset="6641216">These are files that according to the Commission allege a similar base of discrimination against the same employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.256" offset="6665457">For example, someone that's alleging national origin discrimination in one plant, let's say it's a clerical employee, that person may examine the file of another national origin claimant for the same employer in a different plant, maybe even in a different state, working as a factory mechanic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.337" offset="6753856">They may even see unrelated files where in the Commission's view the treatment accorded one group is probative of the treatment accorded the charging party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.310" offset="6793666">The disclosure thus authorized by these rules can grow to vast proportions when we're dealing with a sizeable company employing many employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.166" offset="6833164">Now, what is worse, I think, is the unauthorized disclosures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.170" offset="6853121">Once these people obtain the information in these files, they can give the contents to anyone they please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.308" offset="6881647">Now, the record in this case suggests that the EEOC says it cannot prevent this secondary disclosure, can only ask the recipients not to give it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.866" offset="6919890">We think that the Commission knows better.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.566" offset="6930757">We think that a proper interpretation of 709(e) bars publication to the charging party in the first place, and that eliminates the problem of the secondary disclosures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.625" offset="6978927">Thus, in our view, really, this Court need not reach the precise issue of whether a particular charging party is a member of the public with respect to his own file, because clearly the totality of the rules which are sought to be enforced here authorize disclosure to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.853" offset="7055831">Now even if the Court, though, reaches the narrow question, we think that the results should be the same, that the rule should be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.145" offset="7105046">The EEOC's contention seems to be grounded on an analogy between Section 706 and 709.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.802" offset="7151648">They say that since disclosure is contemplated between the parties under 706, the same contemplation should be followed with respect to 709.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.145" offset="7209013">I think the answer lies in the different congressional concerns that lay behind these statutes, these two sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.334" offset="7249764">706 deals with charges in conciliation information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.589" offset="7278813">Now, it seems elementary to me that these types of information have to be communicated as between the originator and the charged party or vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.266" offset="7333565">Certainly someone who's being accused of a violation of Title VII is entitled to know that he's being accused of that violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.770" offset="7363554">This gives the agency jurisdiction; gives the respondent notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.341" offset="7389781">It justifies the intrusion of this government agency on the private affairs of a corporation and its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.347" offset="7417888">I think it smacks of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.799" offset="7427710">Conciliation is also in a sense a fancy word for negotiating an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.433" offset="7450176">In order to reach a meeting of the minds there obviously has to be communication on a two-way street, and I think Congress recognized this, so that there is some contemplated disclosure under 706 as between the parties to a proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.180" offset="7525199">But what about 709?</text>

            <text syncTime="1967.776" offset="8007524">And I think that's a significant consideration, because under the statutory scheme conciliation occurs after the Commission has made a determination of reasonable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.714" offset="8051306">The issue of liability for administrative purposes has thus been resolved, and since that determination also under the Commissions's policy authorizes suit by the Commission should it desire to do so, there is a sufficient clout to impel a respondent to try to reach agreement before any legal action is taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.080" offset="8140749">I don't think it is necessary for a conciliation agreement to reexamine the whole investigatory record as the Commission would have it under these rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="2419.449" offset="9814257">It's a judgment, though, I think, that Congress has made in terms of what rights this person ought to have And it has given him rather substantial rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.638" offset="9851038">However, it has drawn a line at one place, and the line it has drawn is the filing of an action, as we read this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.346" offset="9889804">And thus to give him this disclosure before that occurs is simply not what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.667" offset="9923136">If the EEOC has problems with this statute... and from what, the comments of my learned opponent, he seems to suggest that they have, in terms of administering the statute... the remedy does not lie to my mind in cutting statutory corners or, indeed, in asking the courts to approve this kind of shorthand approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.382" offset="10018013">Rather, it lies in going back to Congress and saying, we can't function under the rules that you've given us; do something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.269" offset="10041523">And if they can persuade them, fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.655" offset="10051136">If they can't, they will have to just live with the situation as it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.209" offset="10069317">It seems to me that the charging party, though, as the EEOC has made clear, in fact is an agent of disclosure which is going to result in a general dissemination of information, and in fact he receives information from a variety of sources, even looking at his own file, because there is commingling or consolidation which occurs in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.292" offset="10177673">I would like to just point out that there are other aspects of the statute which call attention to the distinct, intense, "had".</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.719" offset="10235351">I think reference was had earlier to the volitional element which I touched upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.321" offset="10253741">Certainly no one compels a party to file a charge or engage in conciliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.807" offset="10271714">As counsel has mentioned, there is some compulsory element in terms of investigative information, and Congress might properly take consideration of that in imposing a stricter limitation on the use of that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.282" offset="10321555">That might be the case with 706-type information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.751" offset="10335453">The duration of the ban on disclosure also suggests different purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.209" offset="10377353">Conciliation information which is traditional settlement type of information is put on a permanent ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.981" offset="10412357">It cannot be used in litigation later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.182" offset="10421239">I think this conforms to general understanding on settlement information throughout the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.218" offset="10441301">On the other hand, investigative data which Congress recognized might be of use to the charging party, or indeed, essential in this Title VII suit, is made available once he files his action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.526" offset="10486545">I don't think it's too much to ask, or that it was arbitrary of Congress to impose the requirement at the filing of suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.780" offset="10511622">Finally, I would like to just address briefly some of the considerations of the EEOC in trying to justify this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.619" offset="10546940">They say that these rules help their investigation or their conciliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.773" offset="10571599">I think the statements in the rules themselves contain the negation of that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.128" offset="10600961">"The stated purpose of these rules is to cooperate with private Title VII litigants and to lend assistance in framing proper court complaints. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.734" offset="10635443">I think that's as clear as can be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.036" offset="10648608">That has nothing to do with investigation, it has nothing to do with conciliation, it has to do with litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.757" offset="10671492">If that isn't clear enough, I think the reference to Kessler in the EEOC special disclosure rules furthers that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.863" offset="10707959">"The charging party literally needs all the help he can get. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.081" offset="10724781">said the Court in Kessler, in order to procure counsel, convince him that a right to action truly exists with evidence to support it, and to prepare and file suit within the statutory time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.472" offset="10770339">This goes to litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.574" offset="10778803">It has nothing to do with the investigation or conciliatory functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.042" offset="10792595">In fact, if it were investigation that the Commission were concerned with, why does it put a bar on the disclosure to employers, of the information in these files?</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.834" offset="10835750">And yet that prohibition is in the special disclosure rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.452" offset="10846303">Obviously, it's not concerned with having employers verify the statements of the complainants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.754" offset="10867515">In short, I really think these rules are going to harm these processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.392" offset="10886009">As in this case, the employer knows this information is going to be turned over to his probable adversary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.796" offset="10911609">He's not going to be willing to turn over vast amounts of employment data.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.799" offset="10935642">Rather, what will probably happen is he'll sit back, wait for subpoena enforcement proceedings, and then in the context of those proceedings seek to get a protective order which he probably was entitled to under the statute in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.440" offset="10986215">Now, will the Commission get its data eventually through these court proceedings?</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.844" offset="11003874">In most cases I suspect it will; the definition of relevancy in investigations is quite broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.498" offset="11030414">But in the meantime, what happens?</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.283" offset="11037624">There are long delays, there is needless expense, there is needless acrimony developed in terms of the administration, and meanwhile the charging party gets frustrated, says, this government agency is no better than any other I've dealt with, retains a private lawyer and files suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.696" offset="11123201">Now, that's not what Congress wanted in Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.815" offset="11135740">It wanted the peaceful resolution of Title VII complaints through the agency's own processes, investigation, determination, conciliation, cooperation, conference, and persuasion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2783.203" offset="11269278">Because he's going to be concerned, as Associated and Horne's were in this case, that that information is going to be turned around and used against them in a lawsuit by that charging party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.427" offset="11314208">And let us remember, it is primarily the function of the Commission to enforce the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2811.306" offset="11381709">But this is again, as I pointed out, is essentially a congressional decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.192" offset="11401248">There are lines drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.259" offset="11409503">It sometimes may seem a little arbitrary, I suppose, to the charging party, saying, I can't get it on the 179th day because that time limit hasn't expired but on day 181 all I have to do is march into the Commission office with a complaint saying U. S. District Court&gt; ["], and I can get the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.642" offset="11499051">But also, there is the fact that the employer can get protection through the courts by taking a hard line, essentially, in these proceedings, because he knows he's not going to get the protection from the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.019" offset="11576582">So I'm not sure that this type of turnover facilitates the resolution of Title VII complaints in the manner that Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.898" offset="11640008">Finally, I think that the section-by-section analysis of Title VII provides... further supports the conclusion that Congress did not want this kind of disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.245" offset="11729451">It states pretty clearly that recourse to the private lawsuit will be the exception and not the rule, and that the vast majority of complaints will be handled through the offices of the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.386" offset="11773964">So... true... Congress gave the EEOC additional some additional authority in 1972 to put some teeth into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.075" offset="11812729">But its essential, overriding purpose remains the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.546" offset="11826626">It wanted the Commission to resolve these complaints to the extent possible through its own offices rather than through private litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.818" offset="11863720">And the reason is quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.235" offset="11869363">I think this Court has recognized in some of its earlier decisions, the Commission is a public agency acting in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.423" offset="11898202">It is not fundamentally concerned with the private interest of the private litigant and his narrow concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.379" offset="11933937">It is trying to achieve overall compliance with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.081" offset="11948775">And it is important to further that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.767" offset="11959537">The rules are not calculated to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.402" offset="11978032">They are calculated to short circuit the statutory process, force complainants out of the administrative process and into private lawsuits, and impede the functions of the Commission as Congress intended them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.145" offset="12032994">For those reasons we ask that you affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
