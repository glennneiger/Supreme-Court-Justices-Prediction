            <text syncTime="93.245" offset="525673">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="99.477" offset="550646">This case presents the question of whether sex-based wage discrimination claims are subject to a different standard of proof when such claims are asserted under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 than the equal pay for equal work standard of the Equal Pay Act of 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.640" offset="631208">The respondents are former employees of the petitioner, Washington County.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.496" offset="650643">The respondents were jail matrons who guarded female prisoners in the county jail and had other clerical duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.495" offset="674676">The male prisoners were guarded by deputy sheriffs and later by corrections officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.835" offset="704037">The respondents filed this case in the federal district court alleging that they had received compensation lower than that received by their male counterparts doing substantially the same work.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.628" offset="739250">They also raised a claim that their jobs had been terminated in retaliation for making that equal pay claim and that they had been refused the right to be rehired, also in retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.483" offset="786584">The trial court found that the jobs were substantially dissimilar on the facts, and therefore denied the equal pay claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.730" offset="819603">It also found that there was no retaliatory reaction, that there were good business reasons for the fact that the jobs were terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.383" offset="858264">And those had to do with providing additional space in the jail to respond to an overcrowding problem, an ACLU suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.724" offset="887626">In a post-trial brief after the facts were in, the respondents raised for the first time the claim that even if the jobs were not equal, that the great differential in pay between the comparison jobs could only be at least partially explained by sex discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.684" offset="967456">The only evidence pointed to were the very pay scales which caused the source of the comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.477" offset="998594">The trial court held on the basis of the laws that existed prior to this case that since the Equal Pay Act standards applied and since the jobs were substantially dissimilar, that is, not substantially equal, that the judge had no authority to override the wage rates set by the employer and the union in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.624" offset="1091172">The respondents appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and raised one other point of fact found in the record, and that was a statement by the sheriff of the county that at one point in time he felt that the matrons, the respondents here, should have been paid more than they were being paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.743" offset="1159717">No other evidence was asserted as supporting this comparison of jobs as opposed... unequal jobs as opposed to equal jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.884" offset="1160240">One other assertion was made for the first time on appeal to the 9th Circuit by the respondents, and that is that they were prevented during the trial from introducing additional information to support their comparable job claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.435" offset="1258460">However, they have never pointed to what that evidence was nor anyplace in the record where they were denied that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.870" offset="1280194">And, in fact, it's hard to understand how that could be the case since the claim was first raised in post-trial briefing, not in the complaint or the pre-trial order.</text>

            <text syncTime="291.774" offset="1319796">Mr. Derr, one thing that bothers me about this case is the extent to which we are talking about kind of an abstract distinction which may not boil down to too much when it comes to actual application.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.297" offset="1389908">What in your view is the difference between equal work and comparable work?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence R. Derr</label>
            <text syncTime="316.545" offset="1418852">Comparable work is simply the tip of the iceberg of an open-ended interpretation of Title VII in the area of sex discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.118" offset="1465141">The concept of equal work is one that is defined by the statute and through case refinements, that's a concept that's understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.599" offset="1507041">But if that limitation that started in the Equal Pay Act is not applied as well to Title VII, then any theory is available to a plaintiff or a claimant to attempt to show that there was discrimination based on sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.326" offset="1574019">Comparable work is one of those theories and there are many versions and explanations of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.746" offset="1603694">In essence, it amounts to comparing the value of different jobs to the employer, then comparing the wages, and drawing a deduction from a difference between value and wages that sex discrimination is the motivation, and I think by the explanation--</text>

            <text syncTime="395.560" offset="1734933">There's absolutely no limitation upon the comparisons that can be drawn, only in the ability of the analysis to make any rational connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.837" offset="1775998">And of course, this Court is well aware of the method of proof that it has outlined and recently described in the Texas v. Burdine case.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.974" offset="1820615">The burden of proof, although it involves intent, is initially on the plaintiff only to show a prima facie case, to show a set of circumstances that create an inference that there may have been discriminatory motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.514" offset="1878711">At that threshold level the courts will already be into the type of a situation which Congress did not intend them to get into, and that's attempting to evaluate different jobs and the relative value of those jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.696" offset="1943495">In other words, at the very threshold level of determining whether there is a prima facie case in these comparison-of-unequal-job sort of cases, the courts will have to make an analysis, a subjective analysis that Congress did not intend.</text>

            <text syncTime="1458.201" offset="5985474">It came after committee hearings had ended in the House, while there was debate on the House floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.449" offset="6010447">It appeared in a proposed amendment by Representative Smith and in the same afternoon was adopted with limited debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.760" offset="6039704">When the bill went to the Senate it never went through committee hearing, it went straight to the Senate for debate, and so there was very little really substantive discussion of the sex amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.113" offset="6089128">Senator Clark expressed the concern of others that by so doing... and since the coverage of Title VII is of course, as we have mentioned, broader than the Equal Pay Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.326" offset="6145970">It covers such things as conditions of employment and access to jobs... that it would have the effect of overreaching the Equal Pay Act and of reading out of it the equal pay for equal work limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.039" offset="6200827">And so Senator Clark responded to that concern by his understanding of the doctrine of in pari materia construction which was simply to say that the subsequent enactment would not have that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.689" offset="6259446">There was nothing in Title VII as it was then before Congress that expressly said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.983" offset="6280658">And that's why I say that Senator Clark must necessarily have been relying on in pari materia construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.139" offset="6301242">However, Senator Bennett apparently was not comfortable with leaving it at that, and so introduced an amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.370" offset="6334156">Unfortunately for the benefit of legislative history, that amendment came after cloture had been invoked on the Senate floor so that, for one thing, the date was extremely limited, and for another, it was styled as a technical amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.004" offset="6392671">That of course was consistent with what Senator Bennett was doing, which was clarifying, not, as has been suggested by other parties, narrowing the scope of Title VII, but clarifying what Congress expected to be the narrow scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.327" offset="6454006">The Bennett Amendment refers to Section 6(d) which was the Equal Pay Act Amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.806" offset="6495907">And it states in essence that it is not a violation of Title VII to differentiate and pay on the basis of sex if it's authorized by the Equal Pay Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.473" offset="6550555">There have been three interpretations put forth for what the Bennett Amendment means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.126" offset="6573229">The most narrow and I think one not strongly urged by any party as this time is that all it did was incorporate four defenses that are found as a part of the Equal Pay Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.387" offset="6614293">The reason that that can be discounted fairly simply is that those four defenses already existed in Title VII as it was proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.852" offset="6648148">The first three existed in a sentence immediately preceding the insertion of the Bennett Amendment in Section 703(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.304" offset="6677928">The other one, any other factor other than sex, is implicit in Title VII itself, which only creates a violation for discrimination based upon sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.564" offset="6718992">The second interpretation, and the one that's being urged by the EEOC, is that they recognized that certainly Senator Bennett and Congress intended more than the four defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.764" offset="6763714">They refer to the entire Equal Pay Act, not just the defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.200" offset="6777507">And so they say that what he meant to do was simply say that anytime an equal pay claim is raised, that the equal work standard applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.243" offset="6813660">But that is just as illogical, taken in the context of what Congress had just finished doing the year prior... and I would point out, the same Congress... in adopting the Equal Pay Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1912.487" offset="7802656">The plaintiffs in this case at trial sought to prove that the defendants had established the appropriate pay for the job of jail matron and then paid the women incumbents less.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.824" offset="7855946">The sheriff, who is one of the defendants and determined by the trial court to be an employer, testified that the appropriate way to pay the jail matrons was to pay them five percent less than corrections officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.866" offset="7916132">He had previously testified in depositions that he thought it appropriate that they be paid at the rate of the deputy sheriffs who, at one time, were the persons performing services in the male section of the jail.</text>

            <text syncTime="1958.890" offset="7988230">The court terminated the line of questioning about any pay differential with the comment that, if the jobs are not equal, the degree of pay differential or the reason therefore has no relevance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.213" offset="8033578">That is at pages 69 and 70 of the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="2000.215" offset="8153533">The Court of Appeals remanded the case after reversing, stating that there should be further proceedings on the question of what kind of proof there was of this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.446" offset="8198463">Therefore, the question that is being reviewed is whether Title VII prohibits wage discrimination for women by an employer paying less than the rate that he has determined to be appropriate for a job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.533" offset="8266800">I think it's important in this case that the only issue of comparability comes because the employer sought to determine the appropriateness of wages within the jail setting by comparing one job to another and also by looking to outside sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.869" offset="8332210">So it's the employer's system that we are looking to, and we are saying, if the employer follows this system and determines an appropriate rate of pay, then he cannot lower that rate of pay because the incumbents are women.</text>

            <text syncTime="2339.234" offset="9509601">That system in this particular case consisted of looking to outside markets and then doing an internal evaluation of what one person did versus another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.340" offset="9542098">Based on that they determined that the appropriate rate of pay for corrections officers was one rate and for matrons was one class below that, which was a five percent differential.</text>

            <text syncTime="2367.708" offset="9623495">Now, I think it's quite possible in this case that that raises an inference that there might have been discrimination involved, given the fact that all the matrons are women and all the corrections officers are men, and it's somewhat unusual for an employer to go to the problem of, go to the trouble of evaluating a job, determining the appropriate rate of pay, and then pay one group who are all women less and not men.</text>

            <text syncTime="2679.394" offset="10870267">It thought about creating a standard requiring that there be equal pay for equal work, or in the alternative that there be equal pay for comparable work.</text>
