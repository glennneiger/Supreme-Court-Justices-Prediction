            <text syncTime="92.401" offset="523479">But even if it were commercial speech, or even if it is, as it is, more commercial speech than other kinds of speech, then it's surely relevant that we deal here only with an industrial and commercial area.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.742" offset="1164838">There are things to be weighed in making that decision, but one of them, we think, is that this arises in a commercial and industrial area of a large urban community.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.190" offset="1222621">I wish to emphasize that based on the stipulated facts we deal here with a case where San Diego has 2.8 percent of the city which is zoned commercial and industrial.</text>

            <text syncTime="510.435" offset="2195630">Again, it is conceivable, although I think highly unlikely and it's really not the case in San Diego, that a community which has never ever had any kind of outdoor advertising could in theory have built up such alternatives of such a discreet and unique nature to compensate for the absence of it that maybe in some city or community they have found their way around it.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.377" offset="2303359">I don't think that's likely and it is our argument to you that the issue is basically the same, for example, in San Diego, whether no billboards had been built or whether there are a number of billboards available now.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.575" offset="2360097">Now, the reason that we feel freer to say that in San Diego is that we do have a stipulation of the parties which says, in as close to so many words as parties can, that there are no alternative means which do suffice.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.647" offset="2416417">So I am comfortable at least in the San Diego context of saying to you that whether or not there were a lot of billboards there or not, the result should be the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="2380.139" offset="9674382">I'd like to get straight at the outset a few factual statements that I think need some elucidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.134" offset="9706356">First of all, the City of San Diego's ordinance does not prohibit all off-premise signs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.866" offset="9725269">I believe that was Mr. Abrams' statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.007" offset="9733837">What it does is prohibit certain types of off-site advertising that is commonly referred to as billboards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.611" offset="9776260">The California Supreme Court specifically narrowed, gave a narrowing construction to the ordinance, applying it against the commercial type billboard, and indicated that it would not apply to small yard signs or things of this nature, of picket signs evidencing a labor dispute, things of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.994" offset="9861837">The stipulation No. 28 that Mr. Abrams refers to does not say that there are no alternative means of communication or advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.520" offset="9911888">First of all, the language of the stipulation is ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.472" offset="9935711">Secondly, subsequent to entering into that stipulation the ordinance was amended to add I believe it was either the 12th or 13th exception to the signs prohibited by excepting out temporary political campaign signs, a rather large area of signs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2467.883" offset="10025363">It strengthens the case, Your Honor, because without it it would mean, it would ban political campaign signs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.427" offset="10067577">And part of the reason that the stipulation was entered into was that, I think it's a commonly known fact that certain politicians do make use of off-site advertising to advertise their campaigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.639" offset="10132361">And the last point on the stipulation is that the California Supreme Court indicated that to the extent that a person may feel that he cannot convey his message without the use of an off-site billboard-type sign, that that person could come in and challenge the ordinance as applied to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.879" offset="10221386">But the court said that that was not sufficient to strike down the ordinance on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.190" offset="10238627">Another statement was made, that the City of San Diego has agreed somehow that if you can't have commercial speech you can't have noncommercial or political and social speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.247" offset="10298813">That's an incorrect statement of the City position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.120" offset="10310307">What we did is, by way of argument in our brief, that that is in fact the position of the billboard companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.351" offset="10339251">We just turned their own argument around against them in the context of saying that this demonstrates even further that what we're talking about is a commercial means of exploiting speech; that the income behind it is what enables the limited numbers of noncommercial speech to even exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="3594.068" offset="14530128">It would seem to me, as I indicated, to a large extent the arguments set forth by the billboard companies are predicated, though, upon where they want to be, where it's advantageous to them to be to make money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.730" offset="14628766">And to the extent that we keep them out of areas that they feel they need to be in for the economics of the system to present a showing, as set forth in the stipulated facts, that national advertisers buy a program of local exposure throughout a community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.989" offset="14693759">Their argument that, what if a community has one small commercial area?</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.722" offset="14712776">And they say they have a right to be in the commercial area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.392" offset="14719463">They probably wouldn't want to be there, because one sign in one small commercial area isn't going to be monetarily feasible to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.281" offset="14746944">So I think, to a large degree those arguments are not predicated upon the effect of the First Amendment, but upon--</text>

            <text syncTime="3655.279" offset="14774947">Well, the arguments are that the First Amendment protects their freedom to do exactly as they wish in this regard in the commercial and industrial areas, at least, of San Diego.</text>

            <text syncTime="3711.818" offset="15001168">And when billboard companies say this is a unique means of communication, I would have to agree with them in the sense that it is unique, because it's making use of public highways and forcing the message upon the public, taxpayers that pay for beautification of the highways and yet, you know, may not choose to have the messages forced on them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3828.114" offset="15466252">This is not a content-based ordinance, and the principles that are cited by counsel for billboard companies have been applied in a very different context, and I don't think that they're applicable or binding in this fact situation.</text>
