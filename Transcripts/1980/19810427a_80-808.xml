            <text syncTime="63.323" offset="396312">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.477" offset="416897">Respondent was convicted by a jury on eight counts of substantive drug and mail fraud offenses and on one count of conspiracy under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.118" offset="463499">In brief, the evidence at trial, the sufficiency of which was not challenged, showed the Respondent organized and headed a criminal association that engaged in a continuing course of illegal activities for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.026" offset="515117">The Turkette group was in existence for more than a two year period and was involved in numerous offenses, including the theft and distribution of drugs, the commission and facilitation of mail fraud by arson and other means, and the bribery of police officers and witnesses to protect these illegal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.173" offset="591708">The group operated in a highly structured and sophisticated manner, in which different individuals performed specific assigned roles to further the group's venture.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.629" offset="637475">The questions presented by our petition are whether the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act excludes wholly illegitimate enterprises like Respondent's from the scope of its coverage, and if so, whether automatic reversal of Respondent's otherwise valid, non RICO convictions required on grounds of misjoinder.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.330" offset="844260">That strikes us as an anomalous result, and every other Court of Appeals to consider the issue has concluded that RICO is not restricted to legitimate enterprises, but applies to illegitimate enterprises as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.837" offset="894311">Nothing in the language of the statute distinguishes between legitimate and illegitimate enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.375" offset="920433">On the contrary, the definition of enterprise states without qualification that enterprise includes any group of individuals associated in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.283" offset="964110">Similarly, the substantive provisions of RICO draw no distinction between legitimate and illegitimate enterprises, but refer broadly to any enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.574" offset="1005279">And Congress specifically reinforced the sweep of the statute by providing that the provisions of RICO shall be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.548" offset="1053135">In addition, despite the existence of an extensive definitional section for the key terms used in RICO, the statute offers no guidance whatever for defining the words legitimate and illegitimate the Respondent and amici seek to insert into the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1134.259" offset="4679976">The statutory statement of findings in the legislative history of RICO plainly revealed Congress' awareness of and concern over organized crime's wholly illegal activities, and nothing suggests that Congress intended these activities to be left outside the scope of the statute by confining the term enterprise to legitimate enterprises.</text>

            <text syncTime="1200.135" offset="4943499">In the same vein, Congressman Poff, the sponsor of the bill in the House observed that truck hijacking operations would be subject to RICO; again an indication that Congress understood the breadth of the provisions it enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.042" offset="4995117">Congress also recognized that illegal activities constitute the economic foundation of organized crime and provide the money and power used to used to infiltrate and corrupt legitimate businesses, labor unions and government offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.406" offset="5068573">Thus even if the sole purpose of the statute were to prevent the infiltration of legitimate organizations, that purpose would be well served by applying RICO to entirely illegal ventures in order to eliminate the economic base of organized crime--</text>

            <text syncTime="1637.468" offset="6692867">1962(b) prevents the takeover of interstate businesses through criminal activity such as extortion and whatnot.</text>

            <text syncTime="3077.881" offset="12454539">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.552" offset="12485155">I suggest finally to this Court, that the principles of severance enunciated in McElroy and the language in Kotteakos which supports it, suggests that he was damaged by going to trial in all these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.815" offset="12574285">For instance, Vargas was found not guilty by the jury on three of the mail fraud counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.337" offset="12612319">Another defendant was found not guilty of bribery in the police bribing count.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.327" offset="12644293">I'm suggesting that to have gone to trial with all these crimes confounds the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.782" offset="12674072">I'm suggesting he may well have had a good defense, say, to one or more of the arson or bribery counts, and might have wanted to testify but was not able to because of the drug charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3158.248" offset="12775950">But they held as a matter of law that reversal was required, regardless of whether it was harmless error or not, didn't they?</text>

            <label>Mr. John E. Wall, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3164.485" offset="12800923">Except for this: I suggest the intimation is, and the fact is, that in these circumstances there's certain error that is not harmless and never can be with this illegal theory, never can be harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.842" offset="12854317">And if I might take a moment just to remind all of us that in Kotteakos, the Court of Appeals had said that there was no prejudice, especially since guilt was manifest and to reverse the conviction would be a miscarriage of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.852" offset="12918369">But this Court, speaking in Kotteakos, said technical, my foot, they said, what may be technical for one is substantial for another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.726" offset="12957867">What minor and unimportant in one setting, crucial in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.297" offset="12980123">Moreover, lawyers know if others do not, that what may seem technical may embody a great tradition of justice or a necessity for drawing lines somewhere between great areas of law, that in other words, one cannot always segregate the technique from the substance, or the form from the reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.995" offset="13075000">I'm suggesting also, members of this Court, that in your decision in Dunn that living, wonderful principle of our law was again upheld where the Court of Appeals in the Tenth Circuit said, it's obvious there was a variant, sure, but the guy lied under oath, even if it was in the lawyer's office, so let the conviction stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.696" offset="13181788">Oh no, this Court, in a unanimous opinion written by Chief Justice... or rather, I'm sorry, by Mr. Justice Marshall, stated: the jury well... may well have reached the same verdict had the prosecution built its case properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.726" offset="13269873">But the offense was not so defined, and appellate courts are not free to revise the basis on which a Defendant is convicted simply because the same result would likely obtain on retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.120" offset="13323476">I suggest to the Court that in conjunction with the principles enunciated in Kotteakos, and in Dunn, and in McElroy and in King in the First Circuit, that the First Circuit decision should stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="3319.451" offset="13420756">I only have two brief points, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.970" offset="13434862">First, Mr. Wall has argued that under the statute, the enterprise must be the victim rather than the means of the commission of the pattern of racketeering activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.457" offset="13464851">Nothing in the statute suggests or requires that, and indeed the fallacy may be shown by the Ninth Circuit's decision in the Zemek case cited in our reply brief, where the owner of a tavern advanced his tavern business through extortion and murder of his competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.485" offset="13528903">In that case, the enterprise was a tavern and that was advanced rather than being the victim of the racketeering activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.639" offset="13557533">Second, in this case, there were legitimate businesses that were harmed by Respondent's conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.476" offset="13576864">Particularly the drugstores that were burglarized and the insurance companies that were defrauded were clearly harmed and that illustrates how the application of RICO to an entirely illegitimate enterprise can serve to protect legitimate businesses from the ill effects of racketeering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.186" offset="13639767">Thank you.</text>
