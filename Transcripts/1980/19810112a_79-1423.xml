            <text syncTime="45.608" offset="329829">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.639" offset="334008">May it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="49.465" offset="345293">The Western and Southern Life Insurance Company is one of 1,957 legal reserve life insurance companies that as of January 1, 1980, were licensed to do business in one of the states or the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.973" offset="419376">Western and Southern was incorporated as a stock company in 1888 and in 1948 became a mutual company.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.486" offset="453336">At January 1 of 1981 it had assets in excess of $3 billion, and life insurance in force of over $14 billion and thus according to Best's Insurance Reports, it ranks 25th in size of companies and 45th of companies in size of life insurance in force.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.851" offset="550825">It's licensed to do business in 41 states, including the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.865" offset="578932">It obtained the certificate of authority to do business in California as of July 1, 1956, and has carried on its business under that certificate of authority granted in 1956 for the last 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.294" offset="660643">The California constitutional provisions and the retaliatory tax laws of California, when Western and Southern became qualified to do business there, levied a tax upon out-of-state insurers which was called a retaliatory tax if the state from which the foreign insurer to California came levied a higher tax on California insurers doing business in those foreign states than it did upon its own insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.826" offset="806720">And when the State Legislature implemented that statute in 1959, Western and Southern went to court, and it was determined in the Los Angeles County Superior Court in 1962 that no retaliatory tax could be assessed against Western and Southern under the California constitutional provision and law then in effect because the State of Ohio did not levy higher taxes on foreign insurance companies doing business in Ohio than they did on foreign insurance companies coming into the State from outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.027" offset="979546">However, in November, 1964, the California constitution was amended to authorize a retaliatory tax on out-of-state insurers in California merely when the state of origin of that insurance company levied a tax on foreign insurance companies that was higher than California levied.</text>

            <text syncTime="263.660" offset="1202110">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.442" offset="1205244">That is not what our situation here is, because California does not lower its tax if a foreign state has a lower tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.391" offset="1233038">It merely raised their tax up to a foreign state's tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.749" offset="1250488">There is no reciprocity.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.374" offset="1256967">But this is what, of course, the Attorney General of California would like this Court to believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.934" offset="1275148">We will expand on the fact that this is not reciprocity, this is not comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.370" offset="1296882">California taxes, whether or not Ohio discriminates on California corporations, and levies a higher tax on the foreign insurance company doing business in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.973" offset="1359367">The California constitutional amendment in 1964 had the effect of levying this tax on out-of-state insurers when the out-of-state, the foreign state of origin of the company doing business in California had a higher tax rate than California did.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.606" offset="1433868">Now, California's tax rate, actually, is higher than 32 other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.164" offset="1472111">But Ohio's tax rate is higher than California's.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.599" offset="1493845">So the question of the validity of this California retaliatory tax is therefore at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.003" offset="1519445">We claim, and the Los Angeles County Superior Court found, that this kind of a tax, which he referred to as a comparative retaliatory tax where the tax burdens of different states were compared, is unconstitutional.</text>

            <label>Mr. Timothy G. Laddish</label>
            <text syncTime="1707.624" offset="6977887">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.841" offset="6990844">I think first we should clear the record as to one question which I do not think is determinative of this case or actually, strictly relevant to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.510" offset="7033476">But it's been raised many times by the other side and in an effort to apparently color the case in the favor of Western and Southern, and that is the question as to whether Ohio law itself discriminates against foreign insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.299" offset="7104634">Now, from the presentation we have heard today and the presentation in the briefs, one would understand that Ohio does not discriminate against out-of-state insurers when they come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.951" offset="7155207">This is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.481" offset="7165342">I would draw attention to the brief filed by the American Insurance Association and their fellow associations, and particularly the Appendix A of that brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.646" offset="7230021">There is set forth the Ohio statutes which set forth what Mr. Vogeler has characterized as this complex formula as far as Ohio domestic insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.875" offset="7278923">It's clear, as Mr. Vogeler says, that foreign insurance companies coming into Ohio will be taxed at a rate of 2.5 percent of their premiums' measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.355" offset="7328869">That's certainly clear under Section 5729.03.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.369" offset="7352901">That's on page 2a of this Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.822" offset="7358753">For domestic insurers Sections 5725.18 and.19 cover the tax that is to be charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.489" offset="7401385">There there is a choice excuse me, it's not a choice; there are alternatives given as far as how the tax will be computed for an Ohio insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.063" offset="7443703">One of those alternatives is the alternative, the only basis upon which California companies or any other state's companies will be taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.791" offset="7494590">It works out so that if you multiply the revenue, the premiums measured by the 8-1/3 figure that's given in subparagraph (b) of 5725.18, multiply the premiums measure by that 8-1/3, and then multiply that result again by the.03 that is given in the 5725.19, you end up with exactly the same 2.5 percent rate that's charged out-of-state insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.134" offset="7667938">That's only one of the alternatives that's given to the domestic companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.491" offset="7689358">5725.18 says you shall take the lesser of two alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.426" offset="7729169">The other alternative is based on the surplus and capital of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.564" offset="7737737">You arrive at a figure and multiply that by the.03 that is given in Section 5725.19.</text>

            <text syncTime="1917.807" offset="7818717">My point, however, Your Honor, I think it's as important in that it colors the arguments from the other side, including the Solicitor General's brief, emphasizes in its question presented and several times during the course of the brief, including four separate times on page 10 of its brief, that the Ohio tax is nondiscriminatory and there is a very serious question in my mind from reading in that brief as to whether the Solicitor General would be in this case if he understood what Ohio law actually provides.</text>

            <text syncTime="2284.548" offset="9285649">What I mean is, I do not think that discrimination, internal discrimination in the other state, is necessary to support a tax such as ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.324" offset="9332774">There are these other issue, Your Honor, other than just the reducing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.743" offset="9358374">The point I... and I'll get off this now, as far as the Ohio taxes go, the Court is... the past practice of the Court has been to take judicial notice of matters in appeals from state courts that that state appellate court could take judicial notice of, and in the current case, I would cite the Court to Section 452(a) for taking judicial notice of the... this is Evidence Code of the State of California... taking judicial notice of the Ohio laws, and also Section 452 (c) which permits California courts to take judicial notice of the official acts of the executive department of the states involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.268" offset="9584490">I mention that one because the amicus, American Insurance Association, has also lodged with the Court in this document the tax forms upon which the examiner for the Superintendent of Insurance of Ohio, pursuant to the Ohio statute, to 5725.9, has computed Western and Southern's tax liabilities for the past few years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.584" offset="9697757">If one follows through this form, one will easily see that Western and Southern itself has paid only 36 percent of the taxes due Ohio that a California company would pay to Ohio under the basic Ohio insurance tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.716" offset="9778318">Now, Western and Southern has mentioned in its briefs the stipulation that we reached as to these earlier California trial court decisions about Ohio law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.102" offset="9835892">I would just merely point out that the mechanics of the California retaliatory tax means that those decisions were reached on the basis of the level of business Western and Southern was doing in California at that time, and presumably this lower alternative was not available to Western and Southern, would not be available to Western and Southern under those facts for years 1959 and 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.717" offset="9930351">Until now there's been nothing in the record to show any later years after 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.450" offset="9949264">Now, I'll move on from what I have said that's irrelevant to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.150" offset="9980088">The purpose of the California retaliatory tax is not to raise revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.116" offset="10007883">That, as the California courts have recognized, is purely incidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.755" offset="10030452">Any revenue that is raised is purely incidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.441" offset="10037244">In fact, the more successful the tax is... as Mr. Justice Brennan pointed out... the less revenues will be raised in that if it were successful those foreign taxes will tend to lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.592" offset="10093773">Now, that is true because the true purpose, which is a multi-faceted purpose of this tax, is to help California insurance companies attain evenhanded tax treatment when they do business in the other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.600" offset="10157825">If this is fully achieved, everyone's tax level will be the same--</text>

            <text syncTime="2516.626" offset="10213936">I really would... I'm presenting in abstract what the purpose is and what the mechanics are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.157" offset="10236088">And I think if we understand that, then the constitutional rules and standards are easily applied to show the constitutionality of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.949" offset="10267226">The purpose that I mentioned as fully achieved... if it is, then there is no retaliatory tax collectible, and I would point out that the California premiums tax, the basic tax California applies to all insurers would only have to be raised 0.01 percent from 2.35 percent to 2.36 percent in order to take up the slack, if the retaliatory tax were repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.357" offset="10404839">So the revenue is purely incidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.090" offset="10419781">The further purposes of the tax are to counteract discrimination between... internal discrimination of other states that California companies might experience, such as could be experienced in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.803" offset="10482684">They are to encourage... retaliatory taxes are to encourage uniformity of tax burdens throughout the United States and thus to encourage interstate insurance commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.954" offset="10535243">Now, this is not the purpose that one normally finds behind a state tax, although as pointed out in the briefs there are other state statutes and there are federal statutes in the Internal Revenue Code that have similar purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.135" offset="10600026">The existence of that purpose as being the valid purpose in this case and the relative effectiveness with which it is carried out is demonstrated here by who is supporting the State of California in this case as to the insurance tax that is at issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2735.789" offset="11090606">But very significant and emphatic amicus support comes to the State for this state tax by the nationwide insurance industry.</text>

Benjamin, where it assumed that the tax was discriminatory against interstate commerce, if they're going to try and keep a lid on that it's going to be up to the states to do it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan R. Vogeler</label>
            <text syncTime="3653.155" offset="14760078">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.718" offset="14762273">First, let me say that if we are in error about the Ohio law not discriminating against foreign corporations, it is an error that has been propounded by the California courts which on three different occasions in suits to levy taxes upon Western and Southern because of the Ohio law, found that the Ohio law did not discriminate, and those cases are referred to in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.597" offset="14873868">Now, I don't know what the purpose is for talking about Western and Southern's income taxes are, and the materials which has been submitted by the brief for the property insurers are obviously not Western and Southern tax returns but they are work-ups from, perhaps those returns, by employees of the Ohio Department of Insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.276" offset="14960594">The question of discrimination is obvious in this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.616" offset="14997897">Not only do we have discrimination between states, we have discrimination within states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.674" offset="15030185">For example, under the California retaliatory tax law a life insurance company from Virginia doing business in California pays no retaliatory tax at all, but a property insurance company from Virginia doing business in California pays a 0.4 percent of premium retaliatory tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.463" offset="15113254">Is that equal protection?</text>

            <text syncTime="3743.805" offset="15122658">What do you do with sun belt non-reciprocative admissions to the bar?</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.132" offset="15147945">You can't get admitted to the bar in California or Arizona or Florida without taking a test, although in most other states, if you've been admitted to practice in one of them, you can get admitted to the other simply on motion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3767.155" offset="15216072">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.951" offset="15219207">As in every case, in every state with respect to attorneys, the jurisdiction of the supreme court of the state which has the right to control the practice of law within that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.589" offset="15253793">So I don't think that the same principle is involved.</text>

            <label>Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="3780.791" offset="15270616">Well, but we're talking about state power whether it's exercised by a court or by a legislature.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan R. Vogeler</label>
            <text syncTime="3787.054" offset="15295693">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.664" offset="15298096">But we're talking about in that case, I say, police power where there is a particular interest within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.927" offset="15319099">Now what interest does the State of California have as to what a tax levy is in the State of Ohio?</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.095" offset="15343863">I say to you that no state should have to conform its own revenue statutes to the configuration of another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.233" offset="15380330">And this Court has said so also, in Austin v. New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.326" offset="15392764">No state should try to impose its insurance tax structure on another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.840" offset="15410841">A state should be free to levy its insurance taxes on insurance companies in accordance with its own needs, not because the State of California wants to equalize the taxes all over the country, or wants to equalize taxes among companies that are going to be doing business there but are from California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.643" offset="15490044">The discrimination inherent in retaliatory taxation found to exist in the unchallenged findings of the Superior Court of California that it is unconstitutional should be upheld by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.715" offset="15554305">It is fundamentally wrong.</text>
