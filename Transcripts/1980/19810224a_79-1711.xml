            <text syncTime="71.679" offset="434285">This action present important questions as to the consequences of the adoption of recent comprehensive water pollution legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.854" offset="487052">One of these statutes, commonly known as the Clean Water Act, adopted in 1972 is an extensive revision of previous federal water pollution legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.430" offset="541387">The second statute involved, commonly known as the Ocean Dumping Act, adopted in 1972, and also amended in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.471" offset="589452">This is an action brought by an association of fishermen claiming to have been injured by pollution of the ocean by some six or seven New Jersey sewerage agencies and several New York agencies, all public agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.218" offset="668446">The action of the plaintiff is couched in several counts, the major one, based upon violation of these statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.525" offset="721736">The District Court of New Jersey granted summary judgment to the defendants based upon jurisdictional and substantive grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.350" offset="768965">The Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit reversed, and remanded for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.670" offset="794252">Three issues evolved from the differences of opinion between the district court and the court of appeals, which this Court has certified for consideration today.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.580" offset="845974">These are, first, whether there was an implied private remedy flowing from these statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.334" offset="872933">Secondly, whether private parties' plaintiffs have standing to invoke the federal common law nuisance remedy declared by this Court in Illinois v. Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.741" offset="926536">And third, whether if there is such status for a private action it has been preempted by the Clean Water Act and the Ocean Dumping Act in relation to the complaint in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.484" offset="985573">In view of the time constraints that I am under in this matter, I propose with the Court's leave to address the second and third issues, on which I am opposed both by the Solicitor General and the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.327" offset="1048893">The Solicitor General supports us only on the first issue, that concerning whether there was an implied cause of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="286.814" offset="1294862">In short the issue is, should this Court now declare that there is a broad based, across the board, available to anybody, federal cause of action for nuisance in the context of the simultaneous existence of these comprehensive regulatory water pollution statutes?</text>
            <text syncTime="307.493" offset="1377618">I submit that consideration of the traditional, well known bases for the Court enunciating federal common law should dictate that such a cause of action should not exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="357.159" offset="1576253">Now, as I said before the recess, our conception of the applicability of federal common law should in the context of the presently existing situation, not that which existed when this Court last decided this question in Illinois v. Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.805" offset="1654830">What we are now confronted with is the question of whether federal common law should exist on an across the board basis in the context of the comprehensive regulatory mechanism which is constituted both by the Clean Water Act and the Ocean Dumping Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.017" offset="1727659">Our study of the occasions for declaring federal common law as declared by this Court lead us to the conclusion that there is no appropriate occasion now to declare federal common law of the extent demanded by the plaintiffs in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.328" offset="1804877">One illustration of traditional application of federal common law is where a state is a party to an action, either a state against another state or a state against citizens of another state.</text>

            <text syncTime="607.412" offset="2577266">Now, clearly, that does not apply here, the objective of uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.964" offset="2591476">When you have two systems, one, federal nuisance law and the other, a regulated statutory system, it's the opposite of uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.986" offset="2635571">Depending upon the plaintiff's choice to go tort law or go statutory law, you can have two entirely different results.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.027" offset="2671725">And even in the tort situation itself, there is a built in factor against uniformity, because two federal district court judges hearing approximately the same kind of a nuisance case could arrive at different subjective judgments as to whether the conduct of the defendant was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.374" offset="2761063">So we submit, there again, there is no uniformity purpose in setting up these remedies side by side.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.463" offset="2797426">I can't think of any other appropriate federal law basis that would be applicable to these situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.002" offset="2831594">I think having negated those which are generally understood and generally applicable, it must follow that it is not appropriate to create the federal common law remedy which our adversaries advocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.476" offset="2881540">Now, that leads me to the issue of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.813" offset="2910902">We have an unusual type of preemption here.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.098" offset="2923963">It is not federal statute against state statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="701.002" offset="2951653">For this purpose I assume for the sake of the argument that there would be a federal across the board common law remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.624" offset="2990105">The applicable rule in this situation is illustrated by Arizona v. California, in which this Court held that notwithstanding the fact that the Court had created a common law of equitable apportionment of waters in an interstate stream, nevertheless, when the Congress adopted specific legislation reallocating the distribution of the waters of the Colorado River, that settled the question and it supplanted federal common law of equitable apportionment of water.</text>

            <text syncTime="825.947" offset="3451427">This Court has been instructed on that question by the very able opinion of Judge Tone in the 7th Circuit, in the Illinois-Milwaukee case which you heard in December, which contains a very comprehensive discussion of the differences between the rudimentary water pollution statute as it existed prior to 1972 and as it exists now.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.962" offset="3547453">But I think the best and most pithy summary of what Congress intended to do and what thought of the old statute is a quotation from the Public Works Committee report on the 1972 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.007" offset="3615685">And here's what they said:</text>

            <text syncTime="986.534" offset="4093726">This legislation was going through the legislature and had adopted this language before the Court spoke in 1972 in Illinois v. Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.008" offset="4139597">And, thirdly, if it were to be accepted for the sake of argument that it did mean federal common law, that then puts the ball back in this Court's jurisdiction, because it is for this Court to say what is appropriate federal common law in that context.</text>

            <text syncTime="1247.464" offset="5137475">Evidence of the fact that Congress intended to give agencies involved in this situation, whether industrial or public, time and reasonable standards, not perfection, is evidenced by the fact that the Clean Water Act contains a very numerous set of time regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.413" offset="5233292">Certain things have to be done 180 days after the statute is adopted, certain things have to be done 300 days later.</text>

            <text syncTime="1299.999" offset="5347604">In the case of certain industrial pollutants that are particularly harmful... I'm now paraphrasing... Congress has said that there should be obtained the best available technology achievable to result in reasonable progress to elimination of pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.710" offset="5426493">I therefore suggest that there is an affirmative congressional not only to permit these agencies to meet these standard, but to be given time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.236" offset="5480515">Congress realized that a pollution situation which has developed for decades couldn't be solved overnight, that it was necessary to apply time stages in which these agencies could achieve the goal of approaching a pollution free situation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="1371.611" offset="5634010">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.377" offset="5645086">I would first like to address the issue of the existence of an implied private right of action under the Clean Water and the Ocean Dumping Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.383" offset="5673194">On this issue, the federal petitioners urge that the judgment of the Court of Appeals be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.620" offset="5694092">The Court of Appeals held that a private right of action should be implied under both of these statutes, apart from the citizen's suit provisions, thus enabling the respondents, because they allege economic injury from pollution, to this lawsuit both for injunctive and monetary relief and against both the dischargers of pollution and the Government agencies responsible for administering these statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.152" offset="5792208">The standards for determining whether violations of a regulatory statute might form the basis for an implied private right of action are by now well established by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.342" offset="5828988">The fundamental inquiry is into the congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.460" offset="5841422">And, as this Court noted in the Transamerica cases, when Congress explicitly provides one remedy for violations of a statute, it is strong evidence that it did not intend that another private remedy be implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.018" offset="5895653">In this case there can be little doubt regarding Congress's intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.487" offset="5909550">Both statutes contain detailed provisions authorizing suits by private parties as an aid to enforcement of the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.140" offset="5940165">These provisions are modeled on a prototype enacted in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 after extensive congressional debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.329" offset="5972975">I will focus here on the specific citizen suit provision of the Clean Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.714" offset="5990425">I believe a similar analysis is applicable to the analogous provision under the Ocean Dumping Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.452" offset="6013413">Section 505 of the Clean Water Act authorizes a citizen suit only in certain specified circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.558" offset="6041834">A citizen may sue any discharger who is violating an effluent limitation established under the Act or a related order of the Administrator of EPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.830" offset="6082898">The district courts have jurisdiction in such suits to enforce the limitation and to assess the civil penalties against the violator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.768" offset="6118738">A citizen may also sue the Administrator himself to compel him to perform a mandatory duty under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.605" offset="6146010">Moreover, the Act establishes certain specific procedural limitations on this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.759" offset="6170670">These relate to notice that must be given to EPA prior to suit, to abstention from suit when the Government is pursuing its own enforcement remedies, and to venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.199" offset="6208391">There is simply no evidence nor any reason to believe that Congress intended to create by implication yet another private cause of action for claims that cannot be brought under the citizen suit provision, as plaintiffs' claims in this case concededly were not brought under the citizen suit provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.225" offset="6272547">The savings clause to which respondents point as authority for this implied right of action means simply what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.628" offset="6302118">Preexisting statutory rights and common law remedies are preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.349" offset="6321031">Thus, in these statutes, Congress's intent is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.484" offset="6337540">Congress carefully considered the extent to which it wished to create a private right of action, and it intended to create only the right that it specified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.674" offset="6370350">Now, in our brief we have also discussed the other Cort v. Ash factors and I will mention here only that, for reasons explained there, it also counsels against the implication of a private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.732" offset="6418520">I would like to note here, however, that a refusal to imply the private right of action sought by the respondents is quite consistent with the purposes of these statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.105" offset="6460002">The primary reason for the enactment of the Clean Water Act as well as the Ocean Dumping Act was to place certain federal limitations on effluent discharges into our nation's waters, and to provide for enforcement of these limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.747" offset="6510575">Congress carved out a role in this scheme for citizen participation but only as an aid to enforcement, for which the primary responsibility rests with the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.805" offset="6550804">Congress did not deal specifically in these statutes with remedies to compensate individuals for pollution damage that they suffer except to note that the Act did not take away any existing remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.261" offset="6596675">Thus no private right of action to compensate the plaintiffs need be implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.081" offset="6615901">Other remedies which were preserved by the savings clause are their recourse for the adverse effect of pollution that they suffer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1623.835" offset="6642964">Mr. Horowitz, before you leave the savings clause, you construe it as applying only to preexisting remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.572" offset="6673893">Was there a previous... prior to the enactment of the statute was there a remedy for violating an effluent standard?</text>

            <text syncTime="1642.446" offset="6717360">Well, I think the simplest explanation of that language in the statute is that the citizen suit provisions specifically refer to suits to enforce effluent limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.420" offset="6765321">That is the only type of suit that one might have thought would have been preempted by that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.091" offset="6791966">Therefore it seems to me reasonable that Congress used the words "effluent limitation" again in the savings clause, just to make it clear it's referring back to the original language in the citizen suit provisions.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert P. Corbin</label>
            <text syncTime="2412.332" offset="9796988">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.051" offset="9807855">A brief review of the factual background of this case that is submitted is helpful to a full consideration of the significant environmental issues present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.509" offset="9845680">My clients are the National Sea Clammers Association and Mr. Gosta Lovgren, individuals who are commercial fishermen and ply their trade in the waters of the Atlantic Ocean immediately adjacent to the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.767" offset="9902732">During the summer of 1976 there occurred what may be described as a rapid and massive growth of algae in the geographic area ranging from the southwest portion of Long Island to a point approximately due east of the southern tip of the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.996" offset="9983607">Specifically, what we complain about is that when this massive algal bloom died, it settled on the ocean floor creating a condition of oxygen deficiency or anoxia in and about the waters on the ocean floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.423" offset="10045360">As a result, there was a tremendous amount of death and destruction to the marine and other life of the ocean, and particularly with respect to the ocean bottom dwellers who were not equipped to escape the blighted area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.301" offset="10108786">The impact of this algal bloom was especially deleterious since July is the normal spawning season, so it had an impact not only on the existing stocks of fish and shellfish but future stocks of marine life in and about the blighted area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.163" offset="10176286">As a result of this the commercial fishing/clamming related industries were virtually destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.983" offset="10207529">In their complaint we have alleged that this algal bloom resulted from two differing types of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.439" offset="10241383">It was first alleged that the City of New York and various other New York and New Jersey municipalities discharge sewage sludge and other waste materials, many of which are highly toxic, into the Hudson River and New York Harbor where it is then carried out into the Atlantic Ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.752" offset="10318601">The second and somewhat different aspect of the causal part of this problem arises from the fact that various municipalities ostensibly under the aegis of the Army Corps of Engineers directly dump similar materials, including very highly toxic substances, directly into the Atlantic Ocean where it was actually transported out by boat and by barge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.153" offset="10424240">Of the three issues that this Court designated to entertain argument on, we first present argument with respect to our position that the federal common law of nuisance has not been preempted since this Court's first recognition of that remedy in the leading decision of Illinois v. City of Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.900" offset="10515251">As we have indicated in our brief, there are at least three arguments which we maintain compel the conclusion that the federal common law of nuisance not only continues but is available for my clients in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.926" offset="10575333">First, an analysis of the two statutes, of the two environmental statutes with which we are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.515" offset="10601664">The Federal Water Pollution Control Act and its amendments, and the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act indicate that where Congress has chosen to preempt an area either entirely or partially, it has done so expressly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.894" offset="10675225">To cite but two examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.096" offset="10684002">First, under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as I believe Judge Conford has already noted, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act has preempted the authority of a state, of any municipality within the state, or of any similar agency from adopting or enforcing... yes, sir?</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.907" offset="10763205">from adopting or enforcing any effluent standard or limitation less stringent than that adopted pursuant to the authority of the federal statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2664.598" offset="10806046">But can't that be read as simply preempting, federal law preempting state law and not necessarily precluding federal law preempting preexisting federal common law?</text>

            <text syncTime="2681.327" offset="10872920">I believe they would have been much more explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.860" offset="10883055">I would further suggest that that provision of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act must also be read in conjunction with the savings clause of that statute, which I believe is even clearer statutory language to this Court that they did not intend to preempt the rights and remedies that already existed at the time that the savings clause was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.375" offset="10977096">I would also submit that there is nothing in the savings clause which indicates, other than perhaps the misnomer which has been attached to it, to suggest that that only reserved rights and remedies which existed as of the time it was enacted, as opposed to the rights and remedies which would grow out of a developing state or federal common law of nuisance or in other environmental areas--</text>

            <label>Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="2732.925" offset="11079287">Well, but, in the Illinois v. City of Milwaukee, the court was quite specific about stating that perhaps eventually federal common law would be superseded by a federal statute too.</text>

            <text syncTime="2749.554" offset="11145847">--I would certainly concede, Your Honor, that that argument was made, but with respect, we would submit that if that time is ever going to come, it certainly hasn't come now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.760" offset="11190673">I think at the time the federal environmental statutes were enacted, at least a part of the congressional purpose and design was the recognition that the previously existing statutes were inadequate in a number of respects, not the least of which was the fact that whereas the previous emphasis for environmental protection was thrust upon the states, it was determined that for whatever reason the states were simply not carrying out those dictates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.581" offset="11313971">I think that a careful reading of the provisions of the two statutes, the Clean Water Act and amendments, and the Ocean Dumping Act, indicates that the approach currently taken by Congress is to afford a full panoply of federal protection, but that that protection to be provided is not antagonistic but rather will be coextensive with the availability of private enforcement, particularly in the context of this suit where you have individuals who are not just claiming that the water that was polluted smelled bad, that they couldn't fish or boat or enjoy other recreational activities normally attendant with the Atlantic Ocean.</text>

            <text syncTime="2839.112" offset="11504038">Well, why didn't Congress simply endorse the common law of nuisance rather than provide for a whole series of effluent limitations and that sort of thing, and the EPA issues specific permits, and the Army Corps of Engineers to permit dumping, and allow review of each of those actions in federal courts?</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="2863.227" offset="11600482">I would submit, respectfully, Your Honor, that indeed Congress did endorse precisely that, namely, the continued availability of the private damage remedy where damages can be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.302" offset="11644786">We have cited in our brief from the 1972 Senate report which considered the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and clearly and unambiguously indicated that the private damage remedy remains where damages could be shown, as indeed we maintain our clients can show.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.746" offset="11718556">And they also indicated that compliance with the requirements of the Act would not be a defense to a common law action for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.571" offset="11761919">So, I think, as I attempted to indicate earlier, Congress declared, took a completely different approach from the earlier approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.927" offset="11799326">Yes, there would be a full panoply, a comprehensive regulatory and statutory framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.831" offset="11822941">Far from viewing the continued existence of a private remedy as being antagonistic to that, as I believe my opponent has suggested, Congress chose to permit that as a welcome conflict, if indeed there was a conflict.</text>

            <text syncTime="2964.610" offset="12006007">There is simply nothing to suggest that this Court today, in 1981, in evaluating our case, must determine what rights and remedies if any my clients had in 1972 when the statute was enacted, when there is nothing in the statutory language or in the legislative history that indicate that there was a time lock on a court's analysis as to--</text>

            <text syncTime="3283.433" offset="13281305">Though we don't believe it's necessary for this Court to reach the issue, we would certainly be satisfied if this Court were to adopt the standard suggested by the 3rd Circuit which, as you know, was the restatement of torts, definition of a public nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.476" offset="13349537">Not only must the existence of the public nuisance be determined, but the comments, the official comments to that restatement provision suggest that where, as our opponents have suggested, there is a comprehensive legislative or regulatory framework which has been imposed to prescribe or regulate a given conduct, the courts are especially loath to describe the conduct regulated as being a violation of a common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.431" offset="13477328">So I do not see that there would be any particular difficulty with a federal judge being confronted with that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.770" offset="13510660">We will frankly concede that we have, even if this Court were to affirm the findings of the 3rd Circuit, my clients have a difficult road ahead of them in terms of the evidentiary burdens to be overcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.613" offset="13570115">We would only ask that we be given the opportunity to meet those burdens at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.498" offset="13585579">One other comment which I wish to address with respect to the continued need for the federal common law of nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.687" offset="13618389">As my opponent has indicated previously, the state authority to regulate to the extent to which it exists at all on the Atlantic Ocean goes no further out than the three mile limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.697" offset="13678366">We have alleged in our complaint a situation where there is a certain degree of pollution within that three mile limit, but there is also a certain degree of pollution from this algal bloom in the next area going geographically from the shore, and that is in the 12-mile-limit area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.193" offset="13764361">We submit that the only law which can apply in that area within the 12-mile limit in which the states do not have any authority to regulate has to be the federal common law of nuisance, and indeed the geographic area, or at least a portion thereof, which was affected is precisely one of the remaining interstices in which the federal common law must apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="3449.989" offset="13947532">Contrary to the assertions in some of the briefs, it has never been established as a matter of record, and indeed we intend to plead, as we have alleged, that permits under both statutes, the dumping permits under the Ocean Dumping Act and the permits to discharge the sewage and sludge, that those dumping and discharging activities were in violation of permits which were issued as well as the rules and regulations under which the permits are issued.</text>

            <text syncTime="3578.707" offset="14462458">We request this Court not to adopt the narrow and overly restrictive reading of the rationale of this Court's 1972 decision of Illinois v. City of Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.248" offset="14512613">As that Court indicated, it was not merely the character of the parties, the fact that a plaintiff was suing a sovereign entity not within its own jurisdiction, that led the Court to apply the federal common law of nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.809" offset="14578859">The Court held there, and we maintain that holding is applicable here, that where there are, such as here, an involvement of an interstate waterway, particularly a situation where there is truly an interstice, or actually, a vacuum, with respect to the non application of any other law other than the federal common law of nuisance, that certainly the rationale of the City of Milwaukee decision remains.</text>
