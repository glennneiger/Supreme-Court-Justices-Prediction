            <text syncTime="68.472" offset="418708">My name is Henry Hauser and I'm an Assistant State's Attorney, and I represent the petitioners in this certiorari petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.642" offset="447338">Certiorari was granted to the 7th Circuit last March.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.718" offset="463638">This is a 1983 tax injunction case that was filed in the federal court and it deals with 1977 local real estate taxes which are assessed and contended to be unconstitutionally assessed on the taxpayer in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.508" offset="546812">The response of the county tax officials... and that's Mr. Edward J. Rosewell, who is one of the petitioners.</text>

            <text syncTime="109.252" offset="581816">He has duties under the Illinois statutes to collect real estate taxes which were assessed for 1977 against the property owned by the taxpayer in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.717" offset="627687">Mr. Tully is no longer the County Assessor; he's been replaced by Mr. Thomas Hynes.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.387" offset="650362">The response that the petitioners filed for this 1983 action was a motion to dismiss, which was premised among other things on the federal anti-tax injunction statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.946" offset="700621">The motion to dismiss which is set out at Appendix, page 11, also sets out grounds that there was not a claim stated, and that there was available to the taxpayer, again, a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy in the state courts, and also a remedy available pursuant to the state statutory tax system.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.091" offset="801140">Secondly, it was contended in that motion that the state taxpayer had available to her in this case a 1983 action in which she could have raised all of the claims which she desired to raise in the federal court injunctive action.</text>

            <text syncTime="221.473" offset="1030704">Therefore, because the taxpayer had the funds available to her to pay the tax in this case and sue for a refund, there is no threatened loss of the property and there is also available to her the possibility of filing a specific objection in the Collector's annual application for the sale of delinquent tax property.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.873" offset="1252327">So that even if that claim was not available, and the difficulty with part of this issue is that the Illinois Supreme Court has not had a chance... in fact, it's not been given a chance... to rule on the 1983 portion of a claim to interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.600" offset="1327142">The predicate of the taxpayer's argument in this case is basically the Illinois Supreme Court's holding in Clarendon Associates v. Korzen, and Lakefront Realty v. Lorenz.</text>

            <text syncTime="868.605" offset="3619230">It creates no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.119" offset="3625291">1341 is a limitation on the exercise of federal injunctive power, but it is a limitation which was necessitated initially by the abuse of diversity jurisdiction, where taxpayers from outside of states would tie up state taxes, like has happened in Illinois, and has happened in this case, effectively, where the taxes have been tied up now for nearly two years without even the matter being decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.624" offset="3731243">But there's a further view when you have a 1983 action being made, being stated, because that's different from a diversity case.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.213" offset="3785682">In other words, the focus in a 1341 action where diversity is involved is solely upon the state remedies, because the federal court had no right to make federal remedies for the state courts under diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.003" offset="3848794">But under 1341, and under the Civil Rights Act, where you have a jurisdictional predicate based on federal statute, then the question has to go back really to the historical precedent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1225.010" offset="5044784">And we indicated that we were raising the issues that had not been particularly presented to the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.428" offset="5078535">Fundamentally, the problem that I need to return to is the relationship between 1341 and the historical overview that is set forth in Tully v. Griffin, where a federal court is said to be under an equitable duty to refrain from interfering with the state's collection of its revenues except in cases where an asserted federal right might otherwise be lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.622" offset="5163276">Unless the taxpayer can demonstrate an asserted federal right, demonstrate that right, assert it, and prove it, then there ought not to be a federal injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1284.267" offset="5281872">In other words, because the taxpayer had available to her the state... the damage remedy, because she was able to pay, a state refund remedy, there is no threat in this case of loss of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.823" offset="5344043">If the property isn't lost, then we're only talking about interest, and if that's the federal right that's going to be lost, then the taxpayer can certainly assert that right, that there's no threat of the loss of that federal right, then we respectfully suggest that under Tully v. Griffin there is no right to a federal injunction.</text>

Thiboutat pointed out, that the state must hear a 1983 action, and I can think of nothing more intrusive by the federal judiciary into the state than to require the State of Illinois, let's say, first to hear that kind of 1983 action; secondly, to grant an injunction or damages; thirdly, perhaps, to grant attorneys' fees, which are not provided for under the statute, or to pay interest, or to waive its exhaustion of administrative remedies, which the State absolutely declined, the court in the State absolutely declined to do in the Fulton Market case, which we have cited, because that was taken up on a 1983 case, citing Monroe v. Pape, Damico, McNeese, and the other cases, for failure to exhaust notwithstanding a constitutional deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.056" offset="13264997">The Supreme Court of Illinois shook its head and said, no, after the appellate court had overruled the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.474" offset="13306688">The Supreme Court reversed and said, no, we don't have to reach that issue, the plaintiff here did not exhaust his administrative remedies, and notwithstanding any federal claims and so forth which were briefed and argued, we're not going to waive our exhaustion relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.106" offset="13385264">Counsel, I think, has been most forthright in saying that he cannot speak for the Illinois court, that he cannot assure us that there would be any remedy under 1983 or any other remedy in the Illinois court.</text>
