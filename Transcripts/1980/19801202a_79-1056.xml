            <text syncTime="86.106" offset="500908">The issue in this case is whether an employer that has been held responsible for paying back pay under the employment discrimination statutes because of the wage differential among various categories of employees may serve a claim for contribution against the labor unions that, according to the complaint in the case, regularly bargained for and indeed demanded the preservation of that differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.506" offset="606443">There are a number of issues that are briefed extensively by the parties and by the various amici curiae who have supported one side or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.112" offset="640925">In my argument this afternoon I would like to touch upon three major themes.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.647" offset="659001">They are, in sum, first, that this is not an implied right of action case and that the discussion about the extent to which the Court should be implying rights of action where there is congressional silence is not an apt controversy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.591" offset="718874">This is a question of developing a remedy to allocate liability that already exists under developed legal doctrines.</text>

            <text syncTime="155.849" offset="779896">I mean, to say that it's a way of developing a remedy for allocating liability, I mean, you could pretty much describe implied cause of action that way, couldn't you?</text>

          <turn speaker="philip_a_lacovara" startTime="170.441" stopTime="245.240">
            <label>Mr. Philip A. Lacovara</label>
            <text syncTime="170.441" offset="838201">--I think there are two fundamental aspects of the implied right of action cases, as this Court has been debating them over the past few terms that distinguish them from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.647" offset="879057">As Justice Powell's dissenting opinion in Cannon, for example, makes clear, the implied right of action cases involve an effort to invite the courts to create statutory liability, monetary liability, where Congress has not explicitly fastened liability on the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.295" offset="957633">Secondly, those cases, as Justice Powell points out, necessarily involve assertion of federal question jurisdiction over disputes that would not otherwise be assigned by Congress to the jurisdiction of the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.304" offset="1021686">As I'll explain in this case, Justice Rehnquist, what we have here is a claim that turns upon a premise that Congress has already created the financial liability for unions, that Northwest is seeking to share.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.449" offset="1086260">So far it has been ordered to pay the exclusive portion of the liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="1171.936" offset="4844236">But how that one provision came to be in the contract may involve a very complicated history of negotiations and that sort of thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1419.212" offset="5833336">And that in particular, contribution ought to be extended to the employment discrimination statutes, as the courts for the last 12 years have regularly done so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1449.648" offset="5955067">And the courts are not quite as hospitable, shouldn't be as hospitable to trying to remedy the relative justice as between those two as they would with other types of claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1724.261" offset="7053463">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.415" offset="7078123">By this action Northwest is asking for contribution for its liability in Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, a liability that arose not under the common law but under two specific federal statutes, Title VII and the Equal Pay Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.559" offset="7154714">Neither of those statutes provide a right of contribution, and the issue is whether despite the absence of a provision for contribution in those statutes this Court can nevertheless recognize Northwest's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.136" offset="7216990">I think that's the point where we part company with Northwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.040" offset="7236634">Northwest is telling this Court that all it is asking for is a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.794" offset="7263592">Contribution is s simply a remedy, and this Court has broad remedial powers to remedy violations of Title VII and the Equal Pay Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.133" offset="7297029">I think this goes back to the question that the Chief Justice asked of Mr. Lacovara, what is the recognized legal right which Northwest possesses, which it claims has been violated, and for which it is asking this Court to impose a remedy?</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.677" offset="7363171">To use the terminology employed this last year by the Court is Davis v. Passman, does Northwest have a cause of action?</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.217" offset="7405281">Is it among the class of litigants who is empowered to establish liabilities for violations of these statutes?</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.739" offset="7439449">The answers to these questions do not turn simply on the label that Northwest has chosen to apply to its claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.744" offset="7471423">It calls this a common law claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.696" offset="7483230">But as Mr. Lacovara has acknowledged this afternoon, it is a claim which has as its principal component the establishment of the union's liabilities under Title VII and the Equal Pay Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.104" offset="7536833">That liability has never been determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.622" offset="7546969">I have heard again this afternoon as I've heard in the briefs, that the unions are clearly equally liable with Northwest for the violations here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.311" offset="7577689">No court has ever concluded that either of these unions violated either of these statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3141.646" offset="12723080">In 1942 this Court in Solo Electric Company v. Jefferson Electric Company, in a unanimous opinion by Chief Justice Stone observed, and I'm quoting now from page 173 of Volume 317:</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.225" offset="12805313">"When a federal statute condemns an act as unlawful, the extent and nature of the legal consequences of the condemnation, though left by the statute to judicial determination, are nevertheless federal questions, the answers to which are to be derived from the statute and the federal policy which it has adopted. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.325" offset="12897787">This observation serves as a reminder that in many fields there would be no federal law and no federal rights if Congress had not legislated in the exercise of its commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.100" offset="12960899">In the absence of such legislation no federal common law would govern labor relations or the field of fair employment practices in the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.742" offset="13011472">The legal consequences of the congressional entry into this field must therefore flow from the pertinent federal statutes themselves, expressly or by implication.</text>
