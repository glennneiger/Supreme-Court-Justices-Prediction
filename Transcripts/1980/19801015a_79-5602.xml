            <text syncTime="67.125" offset="408205">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="77.000" offset="447702">The case of Feodor Fedorenko v. United States, which is now before this Court, is an appeal from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which reversed the judgment of the District Court for the Southern District of Florida in a denaturalization proceeding on grounds that the District Court erred in its interpretation of 8 United States Code 1451(a), and because that court also erred in finding an equitable alternative basis for its holding in that lower court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.523" offset="593779">Although three challenges were raised by the Government in its appeal before the 5th Circuit, the 5th Circuit decision was limited to whether or not the court erred in its interpretation and application of the second standard in Chaunt, which comes out of 8 United States Code 1451(a), and whether that court had no basis for an equitable holding, which it did find.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.679" offset="730452">Precedent for this case arises out of the 1969 Supreme Court decision of Chaunt v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.552" offset="769949">In that case the Supreme Court was asked to interpret the meaning of the materiality standard as imposed by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.462" offset="829613">The District Court, in following the precedent, and the Supreme Court's determination of what was a materiality question, held that the Government in the lower court failed to prove by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the petitioner's visa was illegally procured by material misrepresentation under 8 U.S.C. 1451(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="208.818" offset="974958">The Court of Appeals disagreed with the lower court as to its meaning of Chaunt, and held that the Government did in fact meet its burden of proof under the second materiality standard set forth in Chaunt.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.529" offset="1037861">The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court in its finding in holding that the Government had not met its burden in the first materiality standard test.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.004" offset="1087702">The Court of Appeals also disagreed with the District Court in that there was no precedent for the District Court to hold that it could consider equitable grounds as an alternative holding in its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.716" offset="1158547">The Court of Appeals then reversed and remanded the appeal back to the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="293.157" offset="1312355">He just simply loses his citizenship at this juncture, if the Supreme Court so holds that the appellate court was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.130" offset="1348195">By way of background, the petitioner in this action, Mr. Feodor Fedorenko, was born in 1907 in Sivasch, Ukraine, subject of the USSR, and received a third grade education.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.224" offset="1416636">In 1941 he was mobilized into the Russian army along with his truck and while serving in the Russian army, his group was overrun by the German forces--</text>

            <text syncTime="362.068" offset="1588000">And in those camps he was starved, he was beaten, and he was forced to work or die.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.443" offset="1633453">He was then trained at Travnicki to serve as a guard and was given a uniform, boots, and trained to operate and handle a weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.837" offset="1703043">That was a rifle.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.939" offset="1711507">He was then sent to the Treblinka Camp, where he served involuntarily as a guard for 10 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.145" offset="1756333">After the uprising in Treblinka in August, 1943, he was assigned back to Travnicki, then to Poelitz, and then to Hamburg, all while under the control of the German army.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Burger</label>

            <text syncTime="462.600" offset="1990076">--That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.219" offset="1996555">The reason why I bring this fact out to Your Honors is that in his xx he was transferred not only to Treblinka but also to Poelitz, which was a labor camp.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.293" offset="2048904">That fact was ultimately revealed to the immigration authorities, although Treblinka was concealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.463" offset="2077534">And that becomes an important issue in this case, as I will get to.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.553" offset="2105955">When the war ended the petitioner worked for the British forces until 1949 and thereafter applied for immigration into the United States through the vice consular office in Germany, was accepted, and came to the United States in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.282" offset="2184845">From that point on he resided in Waterbury, Connecticut, up until the time of his retirement from his place of employment and in 1970 he received his naturalization after his application filed in 1969, and in 1977 the Government commenced these proceedings against Mr. Fedorenko, seeking to strip him of his naturalization, claiming that he had made a material misrepresentation in procuring his visa to the United States, that he had committed atrocities at the Treblinka death camp, and that he had been in service in the German army.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.363" offset="2377211">After a trial which was conducted in part in Waterbury, Connecticut, and then in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the District Court in a 54-page decision rendered judgment for the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.171" offset="2424440">The District Court rejected the testimony of Treblinka survivors, who testified at that trial regarding Mr. Fedorenko and his activities at the Treblinka death camp.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.395" offset="2473342">Mr. Fedorenko, in marked contrast to the testimony of the witnesses who testified who came over from Israel, denied all of the allegations and denied all of the testimony against him with the exception of the fact that he was indeed a guard in Death Camp No. 1, but only a perimeter guard and had nothing to do with the actual operation of the gas chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.912" offset="2587340">The Court also found, in its 54-page decision, that the petitioner served involuntarily as a guard under a threat of death, and that his misrepresentations were not material under either of the tests in Chaunt v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.557" offset="2665916">The District Court also found an alternative holding for its decision on equitable grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.514" offset="2705727">The Government appealed, claiming the District Court erred in rejecting testimony of witnesses, and in applying the materiality standard, and in using equitable considerations as an alternative holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.341" offset="2769048">The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals did not rule on the District Court's rejection of the testimony of the Treblinka witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.063" offset="2808022">It simply ruled only on the grounds as to whether or not the Government had met its burden of proof as to the second materiality standard and whether the District Court had authority to enter an alternative holding on equitable grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.124" offset="2880225">It was, indeed, critical to the Government's appeal before the 5th Circuit to convince that court that the testimony of one Kempton Jenkins established the clear, unequivocal and convincing standard required by Chaunt.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.140" offset="2972280">The testimony of Mr. Jenkins was the only testimony offered by the Government in an attempt to satisfy that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.347" offset="3013136">The District Court rejected a substantial portion of Mr. Jenkins' testimony because it was circumstantial, inaccurate, and not clear, unequivocal, and convincing to prove a material misrepresentation under either of the Chaunt standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.547" offset="3109893">As in Chaunt, the Government here was given one fact and that was the petitioner's presence at Poelitz, which was a known labor camp.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.971" offset="3163601">And that fact should have, according to the testimony of Mr. Jenkins, triggered an investigation into Mr. Fedorenko's background.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.816" offset="3227027">Either it did not or the investigation which was conducted did not disqualify the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.503" offset="3261717">The record is unclear as to what specifically happened with Mr. Fedorenko at the time that he filed his petition for visa to the United States in 1949, because the Government did not produce as an essential witness in this case Mr. Ralph G. Clark, the vice consul who processed his visa.</text>

            <text syncTime="845.044" offset="3519911">If I may direct a comment to your question, Justice Brennan, in reference to that It should be noted that Mr. Jenkins' testimony with reference to voluntariness, that is, whether or not Mr. Fedorenko's service was voluntary, was based upon his opinion from hearsay evidence or conversation that he had with other vice consuls, and because of only a very limited contact with three other guards, whether they were personal contacts or contacts with the other consuls, I'm not sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.855" offset="3679154">But he did not at any time ever interview or refuse admittance by way of visa for any guard who served at the Treblinka camp.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.179" offset="3732444">Furthermore, the District Court rejected his interpretation of voluntary because to accept his opinion of voluntary status would mean that those survivors of Treblinka who have found their way to the United States would have been rejected by his standard, because they in some way served at the Treblinka death camp and processed other Jews and Christians to their death.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.965" offset="3855533">Now if one accepts the fact that the kapos that were at the Treblinka camp and that the laborers who were forced to perform mechanical tasks in processing these people into the gas chambers, according to Jenkins' standards, committed voluntary acts or acquiesced in the German efforts to annihilate people because of their religion, that is, the Jews; to annihilate people because of their inferior background, that is, the Ukrainians, the Poles, the Eastern Europeans; then they would not be admitted to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.121" offset="3996176">Their service would have been considered voluntary and not involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.523" offset="4017805">And the District Court felt that involuntary was a very crucial key to this case, and ruled, after listening to the testimony of Mr. Jenkins and after listening to the testimony of all the survivors of Treblinka, and Mr. Fedorenko, that his definition of voluntary should be rejected.</text>

            <text syncTime="1061.199" offset="4384564">Now, the Government claims that the nondisclosed fact, that is, Treblinka or his presence at Treblinka as a guard would have triggered an investigation resulting in the denial of his visa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.882" offset="4471291">This case is distinguishable from the Chaunt case in some minor respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.602" offset="4498145">And one of the respects I wish to point out is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.620" offset="4514236">In the Chaunt case the Supreme Court had ruled that the nondisclosed membership of Mr. Chaunt in the Communist Party was a fact in and of itself that should have denied citizenship, whereas this petitioner's nondisclosed guard duty at Treblinka was found by the District Court as nondisqualifying, that that fact in and of itself would not have denied him admission to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.209" offset="4640564">In Chaunt the Supreme Court also considered additional facts to see whether the second test had been satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.214" offset="4672538">In Chaunt the Supreme Court considered whether the nondisclosure of an arrest record was a material misrepresentation under the second test of Chaunt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.789" offset="4718827">It ruled, no, because the ultimate facts, that is, the cause for the basis for arrest, although involving convictions of minor crimes, was of an extremely slight consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.365" offset="4777133">The District Court also looked into the background of Mr. Fedorenko, the petitioner, in this matter, and in the evidence that was offered by the Government, evidence to establish those ultimate facts... that is, his presence at Treblinka, the voluntariness of his services, and the commission of atrocities, were ultimate facts that the court ruled upon... worked in favor of the petitioner, and the court concluded that the petitioner had not committed atrocities, had not served voluntarily, and that these facts would not have denied him a visa, and therefore no material misrepresentation had been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.511" offset="4961766">It is interesting to note that the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals dropped from its decision the essential term that had been contained in the Supreme Court's decision of Chaunt, and that was the term, "unequivocal".</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.157" offset="5040342">The Supreme Court had held in Chaunt that the Government must prove by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence, that there was a material misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.984" offset="5095618">The District Court used the full meaning of Chaunt in its application to the facts in this case, whereas the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals slightly modified the meaning of Chaunt, not only by dropping that term from the standard that the Government must establish in its proof, but also modified some of the words in the Chaunt decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.349" offset="5193107">The Court of Appeals in its interpretation of Chaunt said that</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.292" offset="5256845">"the test of Chaunt, including, had the petitioner disclosed his presence at Treblinka, would have conducted an inquiry that might have resulted in a denial of a visa. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.349" offset="5305120">The Supreme Court in the last few words of its second standard in Chaunt did not use the term "might", but used the term "would".</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.407" offset="5353394">Thus the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals really disagreed with the District Court by saying, the Government need only prove or establish that there is a possibility of an investigation and that possibility--</text>

            <text syncTime="1936.230" offset="7884659">Although the facts in this case stretch back ten years, 35 years, those facts, and the issues presented in the case, have been relevant throughout that time, are important today, and I suggest are important for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.095" offset="7980058">Over 150,000 people were naturalized in the United States in 1980 and in the decade between 1970 and 1,500,000 people were naturalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.871" offset="8047245">The question as to fraud in procurement of citizenship rights, and the process by which the Government is permitted or allowed to determine that fraud, and the standard under which misrepresentations or concealments are determined to be material are relevant and important to the underlying facts of this case, of course, but to the entire operation of questions dealing with entry, resident alienship status, and denaturalization as well as deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.166" offset="8228431">It is true, as Justice Murphy speaking for the Court said, today perhaps more than in 1943 when he stated it in Schneiderman, that</text>

            <text syncTime="2070.414" offset="8421423">One, the meaning of materiality as applied in Chaunt and derived from the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 in Section 1451(a), as applied to either a willful misrepresentation or concealment of a material fact, the grounds in this case on denaturalization was ordered by the 5th Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.106" offset="8572098">And the second point I wish to address will go to whether or not the Government in the District Court by clear, unequivocal and convincing evidence proved even evidence sufficient to meet and satisfactorily meet the first test in Chaunt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.656" offset="8678364">With regard to the first point, the issue as I see it before the Court is whether 1451 and materiality applied to it requires the Government to prove that the facts if known, facts which were concealed or misrepresented, if known, warranted denial of citizenship, an ultimate fact or test; or whether the second and alternative test in Chaunt, which I refer to as the investigative or investigation test, allows the Government to prove materiality by showing that if the facts, if known, would have been useful in an investigation which might discover grounds or facts warranting denial of citizenship.</text>

            <text syncTime="2298.711" offset="9334560">I think both statements assume or presume an investigation, a concealment of facts sufficient that, if known, they would trigger an investigation, and then pose the scope or focus of the investigation to be, in order to be relevant and material, to the eligibility, the possibility, or that might disclose facts, other facts, different from the concealed facts--</text>

            <text syncTime="3453.448" offset="13953531">I suggest that that was at least a mixed question of law and facts; that the evidence was uncontroverted on the point, from Jenkins; that the voluntary testimony, or the testimony with regard to involuntariness by Fedorenko, was insufficient to establish or to change what would have happened; and the only evidence as to what would have happened with regard, and properly happened with regard to a denial of a visa in 1949.</text>
