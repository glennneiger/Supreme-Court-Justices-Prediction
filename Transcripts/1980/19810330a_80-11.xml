            <text syncTime="43.593" offset="321568">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="46.962" offset="335047">This case is here on certiorari to the 10th Circuit and involves the power of an Indian tribe to tax non-Indians locally on the Indian Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.920" offset="374858">The facts of the case are quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.586" offset="385620">The Jicarilla Apache Tribe is an Indian tribe occupying an Executive Order Indian reservation located in the northwestern portion of the State of New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.863" offset="438701">It is organized under the Indian Reorganization Act and in 1968 it adopted a constitution which purported to confer on the Tribal Council authority to impose a tax on non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.391" offset="504843">It must be remembered that petitioners here were on the Indian Reservation under valid oil and gas leases issued pursuant to federal law, signed on behalf of the Tribe, and approved by the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.238" offset="588226">Some of these leases dated back to the early 1950s, long before the adoption of the Jicarillas' severance tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.993" offset="623230">The petitioners brought suit in the United States district court and the district court held the tribal ordinance imposing a severance tax on oil and gas severed, saved, and removed from tribal lands, which was adopted in 1976, the district court held that ordinance unconstitutional, illegal, invalid, and void, and restrained the Tribe from enforcing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.394" offset="732840">The court of appeals in a five-to-two decision reversed, holding that the power to tax was an attribute of inherent tribal sovereignty, since no treaty or Act of Congress authorized it.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.619" offset="785712">They held that it did not violate the Commerce Clause and that the power to tax had not been preempted by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.807" offset="814446">That raises these questions here: did the Jicarilla Apache Tribe retain as an attribute of its inherent sovereignty the power to impose a severance tax on oil and gas extracted from trust property on its reservation?</text>
            <text syncTime="182.734" offset="878185">Has Congress divested the Tribe of such power by permitting the state to impose a tax on this same production, and by adopting a pervasive system of federal regulation of oil and gas production and sale on reservation lands?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jason W. Kellahin</label>
            <text syncTime="215.155" offset="1007857">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.005" offset="1011201">That is discussed at some length in Chief Judge Beth's dissent in the 10th Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.159" offset="1035860">The State of New Mexico... or the Territory of New Mexico, I should say, which included most of Arizona and Southern California, came into the United States under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and under the late Corporation of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints case it was held that the only sovereign that existed as of that date was the United States and that all other sovereignty was derived from that source, which... seriously... poses a serious question on the doctrine of inherent tribal sovereignty in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.380" offset="1168771">There was never any treaty entered into with the Jicarilla Apache Tribe although several efforts were made to do so; none was ever signed and approved by the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.188" offset="1212030">In connection with this situation I would like to discuss the issue of tribal sovereignty and my colleague will discuss federal preemption and the Commerce Clause issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.963" offset="1279112">The 10th Circuit opinion recognized the case presented an issue that had not been passed upon by this Court and pointed out that this case presents the bald issue of an Indian tribe's taxing power without benefit of reservations of authority in a treaty, since no treaty or Act of Congress authorizes the exercise of such taxing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.979" offset="1375139">The court then reached the conclusion that the right to tax was an inherent aspect of the tribal sovereignty, and with that background it is necessary to address the nature of this sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.887" offset="1418815">As I said, these petitioners were already on the reservation under valid oil and gas leases issued pursuant to Act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.559" offset="1453506">The leases stated the conditions under which the petitioners could enter the reservation and the conditions that would permit them to remain.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.332" offset="1484539">The power to tax was not reserved as a condition of the leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.986" offset="1507214">So what we have here is a unilateral modification of a contract by way of taxation which the 10th Circuit upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.473" offset="1541068">The concept of Indian sovereignty relied on by the 10th Circuit has had a long and somewhat troublesome history and an examination of the cases, especially the most recent, shows that the Court does not recognize the broad definition of inherent sovereignty that was relied on by the 10th Circuit and supported by respondents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.355" offset="1628631">Rather, tribal sovereignty has been restricted by the tribes' dependent status, and the most recent case to address this issue was Montana v. United States, which was decided on March 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.329" offset="1680562">Montana v. United States clarifies the scope and extent of tribal sovereignty and makes it abundantly clear that sovereignty extends only to the right of Indian tribes to make their own laws and be governed by them, to protect the integrity of their tribal lands from encroachment, and to protect their tribal government from outside interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.963" offset="1779096">That is the tenor of all of the cases that have been ruled on by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.015" offset="1799263">Tribal sovereignty does not extend to nonmembers of the tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.486" offset="1817130">In Montana v. United States it was held that the exercise of tribal power beyond what is necessary to control the internal relations of the tribe is inconsistent with their dependent status, and so cannot survive without the express delegation of authority by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.900" offset="1902812">The case clearly holds that the same lack of tribal authority to try non-Indians for criminal offenses as was found in Oliphant extends as well to the civil jurisdiction, and in discussing the extent of civil jurisdiction retained by the tribes, this Court touched on the very issue that is raised in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.813" offset="1986508">It pointed out that the Indian tribes retained inherent sovereign power to exercise some forms of civil jurisdiction over non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.419" offset="2024856">The Court then explained, however, that a tribe may regulate through taxation, licensing, or other means the activities of nonmembers who enter into consensual relationships with the tribe or its members through commercial dealings, contracts, leases or other arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.348" offset="2104582">In support of this conclusion the Court cited Williams v. Lee, Morris v. Hitchcock, Buster v. Wright, and Washington v. the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Indian Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.740" offset="2154215">Both Morris v. Hitchcock and Buster v. Wright were relied on by the 10th Circuit in its conclusion that the tribe had inherent sovereignty to impose this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.714" offset="2202071">However, these were both clearly cases based on the right of the tribes to exclude nonmembers and to attach conditions on their right to enter onto the reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.171" offset="2243867">This was reasserted in the Court's decision in Colville.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.425" offset="2268944">In the recent Montana opinion it was pointed out that the tribe can impose conditions on those who might choose to enter the reservation lands, the Indian-owned lands, and hunt and fish by imposing fees or establishing bag limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.204" offset="2336027">The analysis of tribal rights over non-members in the tribe was discussed in Montana v. United States and is applicable to our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.429" offset="2380957">Petitioners entered into a consensual relationship with the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.563" offset="2401437">A contract which imposed the conditions of their entry and fixed the conditions for them to remain, that the royalties would be paid and provided that the rents and royalties could never be increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.806" offset="2454414">Taxation was no part of that contract, nor did the petitioners ever consent to taxation of that production.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.044" offset="2483357">In Colville the Court in upholding the right of the tribe to impose a tax on nonmembers coming onto the reservation to purchase cigarettes cited an opinion by Solicitor Marigold in 1934 where the Solicitor pointed out that except where Congress has provided otherwise the power of taxation may be exercised over nonmembers so far as such nonmembers may accept privileges of trade, residence, and so forth, to which taxes may be attached as conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="618.217" offset="2620135">Colville dealt with a treaty tribe, did it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jason_w_kellahin" startTime="620.752" stopTime="795.749">
            <label>Mr. Jason W. Kellahin</label>
            <text syncTime="620.752" offset="2630270">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text offset="2630166">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.585" offset="2633614">And the Court found in the Colville case that the treaty did permit the tribe to exclude non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.156" offset="2659841">In an Executive Order Indian reservation, however, under the Indian Reorganization Act, it has the same right to exclude nonmembers from tribal lands so long as they are held in trust for that tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.415" offset="2716892">They have control over their tribal lands although they do not own them.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.300" offset="2732461">In Colville this Court also pointed out that those who come onto the reservation to buy cigarettes are free to go elsewhere and avoid the taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.691" offset="2781989">Here, in this case, we cannot go elsewhere, we cannot pick up our mineral interests and move away.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.697" offset="2813963">The Court in Colville recognized that the relevant treaties can be read to recognize inherent tribal power to exclude non-Indians and it upheld the tax on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.422" offset="2860879">This is wholly consistent with the prior cases relating to Indian taxation and relied on in Colville and in Montana v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.194" offset="2899958">The result does not require a finding of governmental sovereignty such as is sought to be asserted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.550" offset="2925454">Under the ruling in Colville it is argued here that the tribe has a significant interest... the language used in the Colville decision... in the subject matter enabling it to impose the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.941" offset="2974982">We do not deny, of course, that the tribe has a significant interest in its tribal lands and what occurs there.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.845" offset="3002567">But the tribe's interest, insofar as this case is concerned, has been assigned for the term of the lease and the conditions under which the petitioners are entitled to remain was spelled out in both leases, and the tribe retains no significant interest which would justify the tax in this case as was the situation in Colville.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.043" offset="3095354">Any remaining interest would not support that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.679" offset="3113953">Now, in Oliphant, which is discussed at some length in our brief, the pattern for assessment of Indian tribal sovereignty was established.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.220" offset="3156063">As shown in Wheeler, Montana v. United States, Oliphant, the Indian tribes have lost a portion of their sovereignty by virtue of their dependent status.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.610" offset="3201620">Under Oliphant the tribes may not try non-Indians in tribal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.014" offset="3223250">Under Montana tribes cannot exercise civil jurisdiction over non-Indians in the same sense as the Oliphant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.204" offset="3260030">And Oliphant reasserts the limitation of Indian sovereignty as applying only to the tribe and its members and not to non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.393" offset="3296810">This was followed in Colville and in Montana.</text>

            <text syncTime="813.143" offset="3399837">--Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="815.579" offset="3409555">In response to questioning I may have left the inference that I considered the Colville Tribe a treaty reservation, as occupying a treaty reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.851" offset="3450619">That of course is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.035" offset="3455321">They reside on an Executive Order Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.089" offset="3471622">But as I tried to explain, in my opinion that does not affect the right of the tribe to exclude non-members from tribal property and that is the sole right that they have to enforce a tax against non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.098" offset="3535570">Now, very briefly, I would say that after a tribe has negotiated for, obtained, and its guardian has approved oil and gas leases which set forth the rents and the royalties to be paid to the tribe, it cannot rationally be contended that the tribe reserves thereafter the right to retroactively impose a tax on those non-Indians who are there under the provisions of that lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.820" offset="3658554">I say retroactively only in the sense that the contract had already been negotiated and the imposition of the tax is a change in that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.460" offset="3705052">To allow the tribe to take a captive lessee, one who cannot pick up his mineral interests and move them off the reservation is to allow it to rewrite the terms of entry by imposing potentially prohibitive taxes on that lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.720" offset="3770149">For that reason we submit that the opinion of the court of appeals should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.957" offset="3795018">If I have any remaining time, I would reserve it for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1439.583" offset="5905607">We think that notion is rooted in 19th century concepts of Indian tribes as separate nations wholly removed from the Union and not subject to the restraints which curbed the powers of the lesser sovereigns, the states and the municipalities within the federal system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1527.356" offset="6256693">We believe that that kind of multiple burden is impermissible under the Commerce Clause and has been precluded by Congress in the 1927 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.395" offset="6292846">There are two points that are critical to this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.330" offset="6304549">The first is that the tribe and the state are not hierarchical sovereigns attempting to tax the same event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.603" offset="6333597">One cannot control the taxing policy of the other as the United States can that of the states or the states that of the municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.940" offset="6367034">A second critical point here is that a severance tax on oil and gas production impacts the amount of production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.696" offset="6393992">A tribal severance tax makes the activity of production on the reservation more expensive than it is off the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.885" offset="6430773">It affects the ability of the producers to produce in paying quantities and it renders marginally economic wells subject to early abandonment, as found by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.241" offset="6468180">The tribal tax, therefore, implicates the state tax by affecting the amount of production on the reservation against which the congressionally permitted state tax is assessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.215" offset="6520112">The multiple burden, we submit, could be solved only in one of two fashions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.154" offset="6547801">First, by determining which of those two jurisdictions, the tribe or the state, has the better claim to tax, or by this Court devising some as yet hitherto unknown method of applying the apportionment test to such taxation of concentric sovereigns both of whom claim that the entire event, the entire local event, as it were, of severance takes place entirely within their borders.</text>

            <text syncTime="1661.959" offset="6795024">But we have here specific congressional grants to the states to tax this production without any apportionment whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.214" offset="6824072">The legislative history of the 1927 Act we think shows quite clearly that Congress intended to give to the tribe the benefits of the royalty, the bonus, and the rental income from leasing for oil and gas these Executive Order reservations, but to give to the states the right to tax the entire production of the oil and gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.228" offset="6908187">This construction of the 1927 Act is reinforced by Congress's own agency, the American Indian Policy Review Commission, which in 1977 recommended that 25 USC Section 398(c) and its counterpart, Section 398, be repealed for the specific purpose of allowing tribal severance taxation of production on reservations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2384.977" offset="9687093">In the 1927 act the compromise which petitioners make a great deal of to-do about was a compromise which validated permits where the permittees had expended considerable sums.</text>

            <text syncTime="2424.035" offset="9843410">In respect to the tribal power to tax these activities, we maintain... and it is clear from the record that we tried to make in the district court and succeeded to some extent... although the district court held that the tribal services furnished to these petitioners were irrelevant, nevertheless, it is clear that the Jicarilla Apache Tribal Government, which is an Indian Reorganization Act government, and a very strong government, is the only effective area covering this three-quarters of a million acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.189" offset="10067958">The tribal government furnishes police, it furnishes fire protection, it has a road department, it expends for governmental services ten times what the State of New Mexico spends in that area.</text>

            <text syncTime="3007.629" offset="12177712">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.831" offset="12190564">If I may begin at the end, and by the end I mean last week's decision in the Montana Crow Tribe case, the teaching of that case, as we understand it, is that the territorial sovereignty of Indian tribes is somewhat more limited than that of states, that Indian tribes cannot regulate the activities of non-Indians on non-Indian land when there is no involvement of Indians and when there is no substantial effect on vital tribal interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.539" offset="12345418">But the Court was at pains to point out that on the other hand, so much is left of the inherent sovereignty of Indian tribes that they may regulate through taxation and other means those activities of non-Indians even on non-Indian land, the Court expressly pointed out, when there is a relationship with the Indians through contract or commercial dealings or in other ways; or when, independently of such consensual dealings between Indians and non-Indians, the activity of the non-Indians on the non-Indian land substantially affects vital tribal interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.120" offset="12535694">This case, it seems to us squarely falls under both of these principles, indicating what still survives of Indian sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.078" offset="12583550">Here we're dealing with a continuing relationship between non-Indians and the tribe itself, leases for a long term, and operations which continue over a long term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.622" offset="12653767">The operations take place on tribal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.491" offset="12673202">The activities there affect that land, in a permanent way, as well, obviously, as surrounding land through environmental effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.418" offset="12720850">The operations are conducted under leases which require, and which in practice do involve a local work force, so there is a direct involvement of tribal members with the operations of the lessees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.629" offset="12797754">The operations involve the use of tribal roads and the activities of the lessees implicate tribal services not only for the maintenance of such roads but also police and fire protection and all the other benefits of an established government within the reservation within which these activities take place.</text>

            <text syncTime="3268.963" offset="13223028">That can only be a sovereign power since by definition the tribe is not the landlord and by definition the tribe cannot prevent access to a man's privately owned land even though within the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.806" offset="13282482">Any power of taxation with respect to activities there must be a sovereign power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.793" offset="13302440">Being a sovereign power it is not without express words contracted away when the tribe, who happened to be also the landlord in this case, makes an arrangement with the lessees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.786" offset="13362417">Sovereigns do not commonly agree that they will waive any right in future to impose regulations or taxes, which rights they hold as sovereigns, even though they have contracted for a specific royalty or other price with the person with whom they deal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3341.411" offset="13512882">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we have taken no position with respect to the argument that the 1938 Act impliedly repealed the state power to tax under the '27 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.236" offset="13564187">The court of appeal expressly avoided any decision on that issue and it is not presented to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.075" offset="13599504">It is fair to say that the Government has argued for implied repeal in other cases in other courts but we have no occasion to take a firm position on that matter here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.084" offset="13655615">We certainly do not rely in our argument today on any implied repeal of the '27 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.155" offset="13683828">On the contrary, we concede for the purposes of the case that the State of New Mexico does have power pursuant to this '27 Act to impose its own severance tax, but it hardly follows that the '27 Act sub silentio withdrew any power which the tribe had as a matter of its own sovereignty to impose a like tax on activities which are plainly sufficiently connected with its interest to be justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.661" offset="13821859">I might say in passing that the '27 Act does not indicate a congressional intent to treat Executive Orders reservations differently; quite the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.986" offset="13871178">The 1927 Act is the Act which forbids the President henceforth to diminish or abolish Executive Order reservations, thereby putting them on the same permanent and secure footing of treaty and congressionally recognized reservations, and it is also the Act which places vis-a-vis royalty in oil and gas the Executive Order reservation Indians on exactly the same footing as an act passed in 1924 had done for those who held their lands by treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.229" offset="14032092">The purpose of the 1927 Act was to fill a gap, the '24 Act having dealt only with treaty reservations, or so it had been construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.021" offset="14075351">Congress now said it is only right and proper that the same rule should apply on Executive Order reservations and we make that clear by imposing the identical scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.280" offset="14140343">No one could reasonably argue that Indians on treaty reservations had no power to impose this sort of tax, and yet the '27 Act is in every relevant respect identical to the '24 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.342" offset="14212546">There is, of course, no anomaly in having a right to exact royalty from your own land, and if you're a sovereign also to impose a severance tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.684" offset="14270015">New Mexico, Louisiana, and every other state does that without question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.338" offset="14292585">Nor is there any anomaly in having two taxes bear on the same activity when one has concentric territorial sovereigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.165" offset="14347860">That is familiar enough in the federal-state context but in the Indian context it's resolved by the Colville case itself in which two taxes, though in that situation they were found to impair the viability of the cigarette business, were nevertheless held to be both sustainable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.946" offset="14447021">One final word on the 1927 legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.402" offset="14484846">It is said that there was a carefully crafted compromise in which the Indians somehow without it being mentioned lost their power of taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.979" offset="14539181">There is not a word in that history to suggest that that was the intent or result of the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.102" offset="14579619">Mr. Justice Stevens wondered why the tribes had not before very recent times imposed such taxes, although their reservations had been mined for some years before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.979" offset="14651194">I would answer that the tribes were not alerted to their prerogatives in the '20s and '30s... and, indeed, in the '40s and '50s... and only recently have come to recognize what was rightly theirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.175" offset="14715978">The same remark could be made of the cigarette taxes which were sustained in the Colville case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.745" offset="14738234">That is also a relatively new idea but it's not a brand new idea, it's a revival of an idea that was prevalent at the turn of the century.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.034" offset="14779403">One has to recognize that the Cherokee imposed a tax on the exportation of hay whether or not from private or tribal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.258" offset="14828304">It was sustained by the Attorney General of the United States, and it was cited with approval in this Court's opinion in Morris v. Hitchcock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.216" offset="14872086">Morris v. Hitchcock of course itself involved a tribal tax on cattle grazing on an Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.906" offset="14906881">Buster v. Wright, cited with approval in the two most recent decisions of this Court, involved a tax on the privilege of doing business by lot owners in towns who owned their own land and whose town government had expressly been given the power to tax as well, to tax that very privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.239" offset="15012206">Buster v. Wright, therefore, is a case in which there was a town tax and an Indian tax, and no power to remove, and yet the court of appeal sustained the tax and this Court has in both Colville and Montana cited that decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3792.723" offset="15318152">And finally, of course, there is a congressional oversight over tribal taxation, as we say there is with respect to state severance taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3958.296" offset="16285206">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.229" offset="16285101">Your Honors, we think the significance of Section 110 of the Natural Gas Policy Act is merely in recognizing the impact of severance taxes on production, and that if those severance taxes are not allowed to be passed through production is impacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.425" offset="16284997">That's precisely our point of the impact of the tribal tax on the state severance tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3981.995" offset="16284892">Congress specifically left the question of validity of this tribal severance tax to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3988.399" offset="16284788">There is no record to support Mr. Nordhaus's claims concerning the cost of tribal services to the lessees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.219" offset="16284683">As a matter of fact, the record that is before the Court shows that the royalty revenue to the tribe more than supports the entire tribal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4006.277" offset="16284579">Thirdly, while there was no mention of tribal severance taxation in the debates preceding the '27 Act, likewise there was no mention of tribal authority over purchasers of alienated lands in the allotment acts considered by this Court in the Montana case last week.</text>
            <text syncTime="4024.172" offset="16284474">But we think just as that authority could not have survived the allotment acts, likewise tribal severance taxation could not have survived the 1927 statute.</text>
