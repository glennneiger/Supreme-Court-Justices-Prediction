            <label>Mr. Harvey M. Grossman</label>
            <text syncTime="33.128" offset="275176">That's correct, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.284" offset="279774">Before addressing the questions, I would briefly summarize the nature of the factual backgrounds that give rise to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.856" offset="334004">In essence, Attorney John Risjord represents the plaintiff in certain personal injury suits against Firestone.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.555" offset="376845">Mr. Risjord's firm also has a long-standing relationship with the insurance company, Home Insurance Company, which insures Firestone against those very claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.486" offset="436613">The record reflects that for some 20 years Mr. Risjord's firm has represented Home, the insurer on a case-by-case basis and throughout that time has held Home out to the public as its foremost insurance client by listing it first in a non-alphabetical listing of insurance clients in the Martindale-Hubbell Directory.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.149" offset="531176">In prosecuting his personal injury suits against Firestone, Mr. Risjord has included a theory of intentional tort, and based on that theory Home has disclaimed coverage under its policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.735" offset="601602">Firestone moved for Mr. Risjord's disqualification, contending that in his management of the personal injury cases he inevitably would be affected, consciously or unconsciously, by his awareness of Home's interest in defeating coverage, and that even if it were assumed that his original selection of that theory of intentional tort weren't prompted by Home's interest in determining whether or how aggressively to pursue it, he would necessarily be affected, clouded as it were, in his judgment, because he would know that pursuit of that theory would be helpful and its abandonment harmful to his firm's longstanding client, Home.</text>

            <text syncTime="257.678" offset="1173370">The trial court recognized on the undisputed facts Mr. Risjord did in fact face a conflict of interest, but the court then went on to say, in substance, that he nevertheless could continue to represent the personal injury plaintiffs against Firestone if he obtained the consent of those plaintiffs and of Home Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.631" offset="1329165">Firestone appealed from that determination, contending that not only was this not a situation where a consent approach was really a viable solution, but the trial court's approach to the consent was flawed in any event.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.327" offset="1399904">Because, Your Honor, Firestone viewed the matter, or had to view the matter not only in terms of whether the case might be won or lost, but also from the standpoint of insurability.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.426" offset="1500319">And irrespective of the impact of Mr. Risjord's conflict of interest on the outcome of the case, it would at the very least create a greater risk that any recovery, even if more remote overall, would more likely be fashioned in a manner to defeat coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.059" offset="1574820">And we submit that that would be a gamble that Firestone ought not to be required to take and that even if Firestone were willing to take it the public interest shouldn't permit it.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.696" offset="1613377">Well, let's assume Firestone, for a moment, doesn't represent the public interest but just itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="398.013" offset="1734690">First of all, of course, if in fact his conflict led him to pursue the case in a way that was guided in terms of insurability.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.457" offset="1812430">We think that factor would prejudice Firestone because they are entitled to have the case presented by an attorney who is guided by the interest of the plaintiff, not of the insurance carrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="451.490" offset="1948580">And there's an additional burden, I would cite to the Court, and that is that even if Firestone ultimately prevails on the merits, Firestone could be prejudiced by being required to defend against claims which but for Mr. Risjord's conflict of interests would not have been pursued or if pursued would have been abandoned at an earlier stage of the proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="765.662" offset="3205279">Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.911" offset="3214265">Firestone... so I can clarify that matter... Firestone selects its own counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.220" offset="3243522">The problem here is not that Home has picked an attorney to represent Firestone, but rather it's the link between Home and the plaintiff attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.967" offset="3274451">And our concern, and I think the reason that the Court ought to be concerned with that situation, even though it differs from the usual case where the insurance company selects an attorney to represent the defendant and the conflict arises in that context, is that where the insurance company is linked to the plaintiff's attorney, number one, he has greater control over the case than does the defendant's attorney; number two, there are two interests at jeopardy, the plaintiffs he represents... and we submit that the risk toward plaintiffs, for example, ought to be represented by counsel whose judgments are not prompted by divided loyalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.527" offset="3448740">That may not be Firestone's motives, but we believe that their interests coincide with those of Firestone in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.791" offset="3473818">And thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, where the insurance carrier is linked to the plaintiff in the case... as in this instance, the plaintiff's attorney... it's much more difficult to police the effect or impact of a conflict of interest on the myriad of tactical and strategic choices that an attorney like Mr. Risjord is going to make, or will have to make, in the course of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.780" offset="3581756">And, of course, there's the danger that... let's assume that Firestone ultimately attains reversal, there's still the danger that since a retrial doesn't start with a really clean slate, that in the interim the proceedings would have been indelibly painted with acts or omissions of Mr. Risjord prompted by his concern for Home.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.739" offset="3669632">And at this point I'd like to address a question I think implicit in a question asked by Mr. Justice Blackmun earlier, and that is the possibility of a suit by Firestone against Home.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.750" offset="3725638">The reason we don't feel that's an answer is, first of all, that the conflicts question we're concerned with in this instance is really separate from whether or not Home is accountable to Firestone.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.151" offset="3771196">And secondly, we believe the most appropriate place to determine the effectiveness of a consent approach which the trial court adopted here is the very proceeding where those consents are relied on... and Firestone ought not to be relegated to the vagaries of whatever relief if any it might be able to obtain against Home, given the problems of proving damages, the impact of the action of Home on the outcome, and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="987.104" offset="4091039">It's simply a case where the trial court misperceived the consequences of its own findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.930" offset="4110370">Now, the Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit next considered the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.109" offset="4179019">And as I mentioned, Firestone's position was that the trial court's consent approach was flawed because they looked to the wrong party's consent, and consent wasn't viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.090" offset="4230951">The Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, without hearing argument, only addressed the merits in one sentence in which they stated, in substance, the trial court's action was an abuse of discretion and as I just mentioned, I don't think that really even addressed the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.614" offset="4297093">Basically, what that court addressed was the question of appealability and held in effect that in that circuit appeals from orders denying disqualification would no longer lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.327" offset="4351950">I should mention one other fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.920" offset="4366265">At the time of the motion the record reflects that Mr. Risjord was representing Home in one case, the Cannova case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.962" offset="4410464">Subsequently, he withdrew from that case and ultimately the case has been disposed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.521" offset="4444737">Well, we submit that it doesn't really obviate the conflict, because irrespective of whether Mr. Risjord or his firm are representing Home at a given instant, Mr. Risjord would be aware that his firm's potential future business with a longstanding client, Home, could be affected by whether his actions in the personal injury suits against Firestone tend to further or defeat Home's efforts to avoid coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.150" offset="4563228">Now, turning first to a question raised at the outset, the threshold question of appealability, we contend that not only are the Cohen criteria satisfied but that the treatment of appeals of orders denying disqualification as appealable would be consistent with sound judicial administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.327" offset="4659986">Inasmuch as it's generally conceded that the Cohen criteria of finality and separability are present, the key question is whether the Cohen test of urgency is met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.885" offset="4710141">In other words, do we have a situation in which the appeal can wait until the judgment on the merits of the case or not?</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.972" offset="4766565">We submit we can't wait, because in the interim the parties and the public interest will have suffered irreparable injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1223.588" offset="5036985">I believe that would be a valid concern which isn't present here and as a matter of fact I believe that concern points up the fact that in our view the courts which have held that appeal is to be permitted where disqualification is granted, not where it is denied, really are proceeding in a sense topsy-turvy, because the stronger case can be made when the denial occurs, rather than where the grant occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.809" offset="5149834">Now, again addressing the urgency factor, the reason we believe this injury occurs is essentially this, and why we believe appealability should be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.130" offset="5227156">If we wait until the final judgment on the merits, there is the danger... and obviously no one can say; it is a matter of prediction, because no one can say with certainty just what's going to happen in case... but there is a real danger that the case will become indelibly stamped or shaped by the fruits of a breach of confidence or by acts or omissions prompted by divided loyalty, as in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.196" offset="5351395">And there's no way that an appeal for the final judgment on the merits could really remedy that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.131" offset="5383160">And in terms of the public interest... and we think that it is appropriate to address that question, irrespective of Firestone's personal concerns here... the very fact that a case proceeds in the face, with the taint of a conflict, in our view would tend to undermine the public policy which proscribes conflicts of interest and would adversely color the public's perception of the administration of justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1408.107" offset="5775101">However, I would state that in this instance, fortunately, we needn't address that situation because we feel that Firestone does have a very strong personal interest which entitles it to raise it, the question, for the reasons I have indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.648" offset="5825256">In other words, we feel there is a degree of private prejudice, so the Court in this case doesn't have to address the question whether a public interest concern alone would be sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.066" offset="5866947">I believe it ought to be; I don't believe it's necessary to rest the decision here on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.361" offset="5884084">Now, the suggestion has been made that we don't have to allow appeal under the Cohen Doctrine here because the parties can secure relief under alternative means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.868" offset="5970079">One suggested is writ proceedings; another, permissive appeals under 1292(b) of the Judicial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.506" offset="5996619">We submit, however, that if writs are kept within the limits that this Court has prescribed, and they're very narrow limits, they don't afford a proper means of redress in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.486" offset="6040610">And on the other hand, we believe it would be unwise for the Court to disregard the limits on writs and allow them to be used in effect as substitute appeals because that would set the lower courts adrift without the benefit of the Cohen guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.433" offset="6104348">And as for permissive appeals, the very criteria the statute lays down for such appeals would tend to preclude their use in many instances involving orders denying disqualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.254" offset="6167669">For example, the very fact that those orders are collateral might be viewed as an indication that the disposition of the order... or appeal from the order, I should say, would not necessarily further the ultimate disposition of litigation, as required under 1292(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.622" offset="6245096">And finally, on this question of appealability, I would submit that this isn't a situation where deferring appeal until final judgment is really helpful because, no matter what stage of the proceedings we look at the matter, there's just no way to tell what the impact of the conflict would have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.173" offset="6359303">So we don't gain any benefit by waiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.610" offset="6369021">Now, if this is the case, the question is, why, if it would seem appropriate to nip a proceeding in the bud where it's tainted, have some of the courts failed to allow appeals?</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.652" offset="6421266">I think the answer rests on two misconceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.917" offset="6434327">The first, that this sort of appeal would deluge the appellate courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.270" offset="6487721">The experience of the 2nd Circuit, which we cited, supposedly the worst case, does not bear out... 11 published opinions in six years certainly doesn't account for the deluge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.782" offset="6509769">And it's worth noting that in a significant percentage of those cases the court below was reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.968" offset="6530458">And neither do we believe that there's any necessity for delaying the proceedings based on the appeal of a question.</text>

            <label>Mr. John R. Gibson</label>
            <text syncTime="1862.222" offset="7591552">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.799" offset="7613808">In this case Firestone, that has never been a client of Risjord's, seeks his disqualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.545" offset="7644841">This case involves no question of breach of confidential information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.182" offset="7679323">That admission is made abundantly clear in the reply brief filed by Firestone in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.227" offset="7707535">The only question relating to conflict is that... and again, it is speculating what might be... that Risjord in representing these plaintiffs could guide or fashion the case in such a way that would be harmful to Firestone and helpful to Home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.184" offset="7807323">Now, this assumption is based on this factual situation, and it is one in which the complete story has not yet come out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.681" offset="7845357">Firestone is saying that the Risjord theory is based on what he continuously refers to in his brief as a highly unusual intentional tort theory, and that Home has denied coverage for this theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.329" offset="7911917">Now, what is not said is that Risjord has also pleaded counts in negligence and counts in defective products under Restatement 402(a), alternative counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.090" offset="7959042">He has also pleaded, as was brought out a minute ago, these same theories against other defendants, Goodyear, Budd, Kelsey-Hayes, and we simply don't know who has their coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.320" offset="8007943">There has certainly been no record made in this case that Home has anything to do with those parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.693" offset="8029364">Now, the fallacy; not only has there been this lack of disclosure of this information, but the fallacy that Mr. Grossman, that Firestone must face, is this... and I think the district judge knew when he heard the motion for disqualification, the common practice in products cases, in most litigation, is that the plaintiff's attorney is going to submit all of the evidence he has, he's going to submit his cases in the alternative, and the jury then or the judge will determine what the basis of liability is going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.770" offset="8197697">So it is an alternative submission which is undoubtedly what we're going to have in this case, not simply a guiding and fashioning and a pursuing of one theory and an abandoning of the other theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.826" offset="8257987">That simply isn't the practicality of what is going to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.684" offset="8273347">Now, the real conflict, as has been observed, is between Firestone and its insurer Home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.166" offset="8303336">And there is a lawsuit that has been filed that raises that particular question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2065.905" offset="8406259">If this Court decides this case is not appealable, in the recent case of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which was decided in 1978, the Court found that the Death Knell Doctrine didn't apply, the Cohen Doctrine didn't apply, there was no appeal, and you don't get to this whole question of conflict and consent, which is tied in with the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.084" offset="8486925">It simply isn't necessary to go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.584" offset="8496956">Some of the courts of appeals have gone the next step and decided that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.268" offset="8523705">Some of them haven't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.815" offset="8525899">But certainly there is no need to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.362" offset="8532064">But all of these facts were before the district judge, when he made his order in this case, and following that he fashioned the remedy of either withdrawal from representation of one or the other of the clients, or obtaining consents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.995" offset="8602595">Risjord first obtained those consents from the plaintiffs and from Home and then, following that, Risjord was asked to withdraw by Home, and he did withdraw, and following that, that case, that one case was the one case that Risjord had represented Home in for about a 10-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.049" offset="8686814">We have the deeply rooted argument, we have the Martindale-Hubbell listing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.454" offset="8704472">There is no question that they'd been listed as a client in Martindale-Hubbell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.872" offset="8738118">But the facts are that Risjord had represented Home in that one fire case, and they were simply one of six insurers and Home had 10 percent of the risk.</text>

            <text syncTime="2498.420" offset="10136296">Coopers &amp; Lybrand involved denial of a class certification motion, MacDonald involved a denial of a motion to dismiss on a speedy trial basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.792" offset="10173808">And one of the grounds asserted in both of those cases was that those particular types of case were effectively reviewable on appeal after the conclusion of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.115" offset="10219052">And I would suggest in this case, where we are dealing with what could be and what might be the possibility that the case would be guided or fashioned in a way favorable to Home and unfavorable to Firestone, that it can only be effectively reviewable after trial, because we don't know what's going to happen in the trial of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.042" offset="10322810">First, the court might rule that the intentional tort theory isn't submissible and isn't going to the jury at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.868" offset="10350082">The court might rule that all theories go, in which case we don't have the situation that Firestone complains of in which they're simply saying that it's intentional tort only and there's no coverage, and therefore the the load is all on Firestone and goes off of Home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.439" offset="10408387">We simply aren't going to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.703" offset="10433465">So the case is really only effectively reviewable at the end of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.437" offset="10436391">And these courts of appeals decisions that have led the procession away from appealability have based their reasoning on the fact that these cases do involve factual situations and they are effectively reviewable after trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2631.884" offset="10670134">Now, Armstrong recognized that maybe this was an inconsistent position, and the...

            <text syncTime="2648.860" offset="10738053">I think the 1st Circuit in this recent opinion simply determined that it would not reach that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2666.791" offset="10809837">That's correct, Your Honor; that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.993" offset="10814644">Armstrong, particularly, pointed out that in cases of this kind the trial court can always reconsider the motion, that protective orders can be issued, and that, of course, reversal and a new trial on the appellate level are sufficient remedies to take care of the particular problem involved in this kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.703" offset="10905445">Now, the recusal cases that were the subject a minute ago are one specific incident where courts have refused appealability... and I would say that there is far more problem from the public perception of justice so far as recusal motions of the trial judge than is involved in the attorney situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.538" offset="11000740">Certainly, if they're even, the recusal cases are strong evidence that there should be no appeal in this type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.360" offset="11040028">Mr. Justice Stevens in Coopers &amp; Lybrand observed that rulings on venue, summary judgment, and discovery, really were not different from determinations of class action issues that were involved in that case and certainly they are not different from disqualification motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.650" offset="11121217">There are other issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.649" offset="11129263">Now, the 1st Circuit, the new 1st Circuit decision, Armstrong, both pointed to the important legal issue as an aspect of the Cohen Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.177" offset="11167297">Armstrong recognized that there was a split in this reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.205" offset="11187463">Cohen did say that it was the right to security for cost that was the issue in that case that merited appealability, and if it had been a discretionary ruling, this would not have been an appealable order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.934" offset="11250366">Again, Armstrong goes back and forth on whether this is an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.555" offset="11276802">The 1st Circuit new decision does say that this is an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.461" offset="11292476">In the Coopers &amp; Lybrand decision, Mr. Justice Stevens was particularly writing about the Death Knell Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.082" offset="11322987">But he said there that to allow appeals from cases that turned on the facts throws the appellate court into the trial business, and obliterates the distinction between the function of the trial court and the function of the appellate court as has been set out in the statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.042" offset="11406787">One other reason for the importance of the issue being a factor in this case is that 1292(b), the discretionary appeal statute, did not exist when Cohen was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.757" offset="11461645">It now does exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.099" offset="11467078">And in those cases where there is the possibility of irreparable harm, 1292 is available and 1651 mandamus is also available.</text>

            <text syncTime="3223.239" offset="13035574">In this case I think there is the aspect to the case of attempting to rid oneself of a very vigorous advocate, a lawyer that has probed deeply, that is... I think publicity in a companion Goodyear case was one of the grounds in this motion that went its way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.165" offset="13123241">They have probed into the Watergate documents deeply to find a connection with the slush fund theory, and where they're going with that I don't know, but we have a vigorous advocate, and as these courts in the appealability issues rule, the tactical, strategic use of this, the disguised harassment, the artifice of what I think Armstrong refers to as "the artful movement" is much with the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3308.891" offset="13378196">In one of the cases, the relief that is requested by Firestone in this case in the trial court simply was that Risjord be disqualified in any case in which Home had coverage or in which confidential information had passed from... in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.288" offset="13467744">Now, the admission is clear that there was no passage of confidential information, because Risjord's only representation of Home was in the totally unrelated fire case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.769" offset="13509749">And the other basis for the motion was not satisfied because Home did not provide coverage in the Hale case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.749" offset="13545589">And this simply shows the overbroad reach of the motion that is filed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.917" offset="13578294">But the whole issue on merits, the whole issue on who has the right to consent... and I might say that this question of consent is discussed in the 4th Circuit opinion in the Aetna Casualty case that's referred to in the Solicitor General's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.035" offset="13650810">And they point very clearly to the fact that it is the client that is required to give the consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.799" offset="13677873">And in that case, a foreigner to this attorney-client relationship is attempting to assert this theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.000" offset="13710683">And the 4th Circuit held that it is the right of a client that exists to give the consent, and that's exactly what was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.683" offset="13757390">Consents were obtained from Home, they were obtained from the personal injury claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.555" offset="13780900">And I might say, in discussing the question of the discretion of the trial court, one other fact that has not come before this Court, there is much assertion in the argument of Firestone that Risjord obtained consents from the unsophisticated plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.142" offset="13851222">And this Court was not told in the briefs that three of those unsophisticated plaintiffs had referring counsel and that those referring counsel had discussed the consents with their clients, and had obtained the consents from the clients and the referring counsel had also given their consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.070" offset="13946934">But it is omissions of fact of this kind, and of course there are assertions that Home and Risjord are acting in tandem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.817" offset="13977863">There is no evidence of that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.941" offset="13982356">And the district judge said, there are many speculative matters that he is not going to get to, but here we have the question of purely a factual determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.812" offset="14037841">We have the trial court exercising discretion, finding the facts, reaching conclusions from the facts, fashioning a remedy of either withdrawal from the representation of one or filing the consents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.540" offset="14096773">Risjord did both of those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.054" offset="14110879">There simply is no issue in this case that requires disqualification, and the entire issue really can turn on the fact that this is a case that should not be appealable, and that ends the entire discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.094" offset="14170961">I ask this Court to affirm the ruling of the district court.</text>
