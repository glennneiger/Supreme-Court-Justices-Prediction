            <text syncTime="9.278" offset="182555">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.433" offset="199169">This is a case which presents the question of whether Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which is 42 U.S.C. 1973c, requires the pre-clearance of a county reapportionment plan which was prepared after a trial at the Court's direction, after a previous plan had been invalidated, and after an evidentiary hearing upon the use of the proposed plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.904" offset="333020">And when the plan that was newly completed was declared by the trial court to be one which should be used for the 1980 elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.729" offset="376279">The original lawsuit was brought alleging an existing districting plan for four commissioners' precincts of Kleberg County to be unconstitutional first because the existing plan diluted the vote of the Mexican-American residents of the County, and secondly because it violated the one-man-one-vote principle of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.795" offset="488605">The trial of the case was devoted primarily to the first question; that is, whether the existing plan diluted the voting strength of Mexican-American residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.431" offset="535103">At the conclusion of the trial the trial court held that there had been no dilution of Mexican-American voting strength but that there was a violation of the one-man-one-vote principle and ordered that the County prepare a new plan and submit it to the Court for consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.813" offset="624651">The trial court set a hearing date on the new plan, the parties appeared at that time... and incidentally, this was a class action brought by Mexican-American residents of Kleberg County.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.090" offset="677732">At the evidentiary hearing on the plan, the trial court heard evidence as to the statistical results and also heard questions with respect to the effect of the new plan on the voting strength of Mexican-Americans, how Mexican-American residents and voters had been affected by the particular plan that was presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.532" offset="787551">The plan was actually prepared by a professor from Texas A &amp; I University, whose sole objective was to achieve an equality in number between the four precincts.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.557" offset="843662">He was instructed however, on one occasion, that the County would prefer that a boundary line be withdrawn to include the courthouse in Commissioners' precinct number 1, he was also asked to try to maintain the integrity of existing voting or election precincts, rather than to divide them up.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.516" offset="943450">He accomplished all this, although he did have to divide or split a number of voting precincts.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.980" offset="981379">And as we have pointed out in our brief, this is an action which could only be taken by the Commissioners' Court in July or August of a given year and it was not done in the Texas Court... it was not done in that time-period and the Texas courts have held that a Commissioners' Court, itself, is absolutely precluded from making a division of Commissioners' precincts other than at the stated time, and that is--</text>

            <label>Justice Blackmun</label>

            <text syncTime="241.233" offset="1110320">--I know they do, Your Honor, but I disagree with my opposition, because I think that the case of Wilson v. Weller makes it very clear, both in its holding and its distinguishing of another Texas Supreme Court case that where in fact election precincts... and we're not talking about Commissioners' precincts at this point, we're talking about election precincts, when election precincts are divided, or the boundaries are re-drawn... it can only be done in July or August and at no other time.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.751" offset="1248455">In any event, it is a factor in this lawsuit simply because of this Court's holding in East Carroll Parish v. Marshall, in which the fact that a Louisiana police jury had no authority to reapportion itself pursuant to an enabling statute which had been questioned by the Attorney General was suggested to be dispositive of the question whether the particular plan was a court-ordered plan or was a legislative plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.389" offset="1422953">In any event, the trial court did review the plan and in its order stated that he had considered the Plaintiff's objections to the plan as well, and the Plaintiff did come forward with evidence challenging the proposed plan on the basis that it did dilute Mexican-American voting strength.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.818" offset="1512710">The Court concluded that the plan was acceptable and ordered that it should be used in 1980.</text>

            <text syncTime="355.468" offset="1567254">And following his approval of the plan, there followed a series of procedural steps which resulted in the Fifth Circuit's summary determination that the plan could not be used and should be submitted to the Attorney General or to the District Court in the District of Columbia for preclearance under the Voting Rights Act before it could be put into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.394" offset="1683028">And of course, that raises the question presented... the question presented here, whether a plan conceived as this one was, in the course of litigation which had been long since commenced was required to be submitted for Section 5 preclearance or whether the District Court could order such a plan into effect without preclearance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1165.800" offset="4808632">All right, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.940" offset="4813125">In any event, the decision of the Fifth Circuit brings us here and we have a number of reasons for believing that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act as it relates to preclearance should not be applicable in a case which is already in a federal district court and already subject to constitutional scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.600" offset="4923779">The first reason for this is that as we view the Voting Rights Act, it assumes the existence and the continuation of an existing plan, both the legislative history and the decisions of this Court have referred to the effect of the plan... of the Voting Rights Act in Section 5 as in effect, freezing into use and existence an existing plan, and if that were the case there would be no problem or hardship so far as the election process in the County is concerned because it would, as it went through the machinery prescribed by the Voting Rights Act, have an existing plan that could be used during the time required for that procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.314" offset="5126699">But that is not the case where the catalyst for the presentation of a new plan is an order of a federal court striking down the old plan, there is no plan then to be frozen into effect and there is no plan prepared or participated in by the local, political subdivisions which can be utilized during the interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.288" offset="5226591">We also think that the language of the Voting Rights Act which speaks to changes in procedure which a subdivision, political subdivision "enacts or seeks to administer" is not simply fortuitous language; we think that the legislature meant what it said, that it was speaking of changes that were voluntarily undertaken by a political subdivision, that is, the political subdivision enacted or sought to administer a particular plan which was different from the one that had existed before and which had been frozen into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.928" offset="5393148">This is not a case in which the Commissioners' Court enacted or sought to administer a new plan, it did neither.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.753" offset="5428465">It was told by the trial court it could not use its old plan and that it should submit a new plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.186" offset="5458140">So, for that reason also, we think the Voting Rights Act does not apply in a case involving these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.668" offset="5496070">Third, the Voting Rights Act and the decisions of this Court speak to the purpose of insuring that there is a federal presence in the formulation of any plan which is different from the one which had been frozen into effect by the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.363" offset="5570885">And we have a federal presence in this case, very much so; we have the most intense federal presence that you could imagine, in the discarding of the old plan and the formulation of the new plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.592" offset="5631802">We had a federal district judge in Corpus Christi, Texas, one county over from Kleberg County, that was aware of all the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.073" offset="5661686">He had already listened in detail to the plaintiff's class action challenge of the existing plan, he knew intimately what the circumstances and background were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.099" offset="5709856">And there was no better forum anywhere to consider the changes which were proposed than the local federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.438" offset="5755205">So that objective of the Voting Rights Act, we think, has been squarely met in the case of a plan which is presented following the striking down of an existing plan by a federal district court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1423.274" offset="5838483">The... I suppose the other side of the coin is, that the federal presence of which you speak is a specific federal presence, namely, the Attorney General or the District Court of the District of Columbia?</text>

            <text syncTime="1436.221" offset="5890310">Well that, I'm sure is the argument in support of the applicability of the Voting Rights Act, Your Honor, but certainly the legislative history didn't speak to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.952" offset="5933255">It does... it does speak to the existence of a body of expertise, and uniformity that is sought by channeling all of these decisions through the Attorney General or the District Court of the District of Columbia, but for the life of me, I don't see that the Attorney General or the District Court of the District of Columbia, no disparagement intended, has any greater expertise in a case of this type where a local federal district court has already considered in great detail in an adversary proceeding, the various factors which would affect the formulation of a new claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.042" offset="6117575">And finally, it seems to me that the Voting Rights Act does not contemplate the existence of a pending suit which already raises constitutional issues which the... with which the local federal court has grappled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.721" offset="6196256">And that is perhaps a different facet of the suggestion that where you do have a federal presence already involved with a lawsuit there is no occasion to seek further federal presence in the form of an Attorney General or the District Court in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.557" offset="6271593">The decision, we think, of the Fifth Circuit ignores completely this Court's decision in East Carroll Parish School Board v. Marshall, in which, in virtually identical situation, the question was raised in an amicus curiae brief by the United States and in which this Court said that Section 5 preclearance was not required in the case of a plan which was prepared at the instance of a federal district court and submitted to a federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.168" offset="6418088">The... I would like to point out that I see more problems with requiring preclearance of a plan conceived in the course of existing district court litigation, than I do in, in not requiring preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.720" offset="6516308">First of these, of course, is the tremendous delay and expense incident to a preclearance procedure when you already have a pending lawsuit in a local district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.011" offset="6569494">As I understand those cases, in which the question might be raised and as I understand the Voting Rights Act, if the trial court were required in this case to remand the County to the Attorney General of the District Court of Columbia, the County could go to the Attorney General and proceed back and forth until a plan had been approved there or disapproved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.312" offset="6686627">It could then, if it were disapproved, it could go to the District Court in the District of Columbia; I assume an appeal could follow that, and then, the case could go back to the trial court where, by the express terms of the Voting Rights Act, the question of constitutionality could be litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.647" offset="6784011">And if the trial court should determine at that point that the plan was unconstitutional although it didn't violate the provisions of the Voting Rights Act, we would start, I gather, all over on this procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.671" offset="6844093">And I think that is a... I think that defeats the equitable jurisdiction of the Court and I think it... it insures a multiplicity of litigations and perhaps harm to the voters themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.288" offset="6918594">I can conceive that a political subdivision which does not wish to get right on with a new plan could perpetuate its own unconstitutionally elected officials in office indeterminately by playing the game of proceeding to the Attorney General, of submitting half-hearted plans and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.388" offset="7019009">And I realize the answer to that is, well the trial court could prepare his own plan and order it into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.010" offset="7045445">But it seems to me that at that point we would come back to the question then of why it should be that a district court plan is not subject to Section 5 preclearance, why the district court has sufficient ability and expertise to prepare its own plan, but not to review a plan prepared or submitted by a local political subdivision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.076" offset="7169683">We think everything about the Voting Rights Act and everything that relates to the question of preclearance is directed towards voluntarily undertaken changes in voting procedures and not the one which is taking place under the scrutiny of federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1799.620" offset="7343868">On October 2nd, 1979, approximately one year after the trial on the merits, the district court found that Kleberg County was mal-apportioned and in the October 2nd order the district court informed the defendant that the initial burden of fashioning the constitutionally acceptable remedy was on the Commissioners' Court, the district court quoting Wise, then advised the defendants that it would afford them a reasonable opportunity to meet constitutional requirements by adopting a substitute measure and that the Commissioners' Court was unwilling or unable to present the Court with a substitute plan, then it would become the unwelcome obligation of the District Court to devise its own plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.258" offset="7526411">The District Court then directed the Commissioners' Court to come up with a plan and a hearing was set on that plan on December 10, 1979, approximately 60... two months later.</text>

            <text syncTime="2016.643" offset="8211969">Because presumably a lot of state and municipal subdivisions are going to be subject to suit if they don't redistrict themselves on the basis of new population figures and yet if the District Court in which the suit is brought finds that they are mal-apportioned and directs them to submit a plan, they may be under some state law restraint as to whether or not they can do the particular thing that the District Court wants.</text>

            <text syncTime="2055.846" offset="8368808">Yes sir, I understand that position, but I believe that legislative history will show that a correct application of Section 5 is that whenever... when the legislative body has received a judicial deferral, to come up and present a substitute plan, when that legislative body has finalized its plan which incorporates public policy objectives and is preparing to submit that plan to the District Court, it is in effect seeking to administer that plan through incorporation in the court's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.991" offset="8493360">And by seeking to administer that plan, by incorporation in the court's order it falls under the operational language of Section 5, which is whenever a political subdivision seeks to administer a voting change then that change must be precleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.017" offset="8557517">Our position would be that the legislative body in that particular case, as part of its legislative duty to come forward with a valid plan, would have had to have Section 5 preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.278" offset="8598477">The issue of whether or not it actually had legislative authority does not matter because although... because, the plan could be implemented through the court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.492" offset="8643407">Operational language is to seek to administer, it doesn't necessarily require that they have to enact it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2154.995" offset="8765347">Nonetheless, Plaintiffs bring an action in the District Court saying you're violating our constitutional rights because it's not one-man-one-vote.</text>

            <text syncTime="2622.634" offset="10635923">That opinion is opinion number M606, and the facts of the case are that Bailey County, Texas redistricted their Commissioners' Court precinct lines in January of 1970 and in the process of redistricting their Commissioners' Court precinct lines they split election precincts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.454" offset="10715231">Bailey County then sent a letter to the Attorney General and said now that we've split election precincts can we conform those election precincts with the Commissioners' Court precincts?</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.858" offset="10752847">And the Attorney General responded and said yes, I understand your situation, you did split the election precincts, that's fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.712" offset="10780223">But you cannot now conform them; you have to wait until the July or August term of Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.337" offset="10802793">I have a copy of that opinion here today if the Court would like me to leave it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.615" offset="10819825">Additionally in that case the Attorney General cited the various articles of the Texas Election Code and the Texas Constitution that have been argued back and forth here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.237" offset="10858382">The Attorney General also cited the case of Wilson v. Weller, which the Petitioners depended on for their support, but they did not have legislative authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.656" offset="10892028">I might add that in the case of Wilson v. Weller, that involved a single unitary order of Kleberg County; it involved the same county, where they redistricted Commissioners' Court precincts and election precincts at the same time, in the same order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.446" offset="10947198">And the Court in that case found that they could not redistrict election precincts, although they could redistrict Commissioners' Court precincts they could not redistrict election precincts, and they invalidated that part of the order in reference to the redistricting of the election precincts.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="2738.430" offset="11099126">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.163" offset="11122010">Counsel for the Petitioners has correctly stated that there was a federal presence to which the Commissioners' Court submitted their proposal for reapportionment, but that was wholly apart from who the federal presence was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.266" offset="11190450">The District Court did not purport to apply the standards of Section 5, did not make any inquiry about whether there was a retrogression in the treatment of minority voters within the meaning of this Court's decision in Beer, let alone place the burden of proof on the covered jurisdiction that it would have to sustain under Section 5 in proving that the purpose or effect is not to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.126" offset="11329944">The question before the Court is really a narrow question of statutory interpretation about the meaning of the words seek to administer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.356" offset="11370800">In Section 5, it's a question that the Court has found recurringly troublesome in trying to interrelate Section 5 with reapportionment litigation and there is, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist has suggested, a need for as much clarification as possible now, with all the reapportionments that will be resulting from the 1980 census.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.236" offset="11478320">For the interpretation of this language to be consistent with the statutory purpose, it is crucial in our view that two very serious pitfalls be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.308" offset="11546656">One is to avoid an interpretation that gives jurisdictions covered by Section 5 a dis-incentive to reapportion themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.380" offset="11602976">It is settled by this Court's decisions and by the legislative history that Section 5 does apply to reapportionments, and this Court has reiterated time and again that reapportionment is principally and ideally, a legislative function and that legislative bodies should be given an opportunity to undertake to do the reapportionment on their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.119" offset="11721885">But it's always easy in these situations for a legislature to do nothing and to hold back as was the case of the Commissioner's Court here until 8 years after the 1970 census.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.251" offset="11786460">And it's not uncommon in covered jurisdictions for us to encounter this kind of holding back even under the 1970 census, particularly if there's hope that thereby a reapportionment will eventually be achieved after someone brings a lawsuit without the necessity to submit the legislature's proposal for Section 5 preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.381" offset="11898891">And if the covered jurisdiction can avoid submitting the proposal that way and still propose it to the reapportionment court, under an entitlement to deference from that Court under this Court's decision in Wise v. Lipscomb, the deference that would be afforded to a legislative proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.199" offset="12006202">Then the way is open it seems to us, to widespread evasion of this Court's decision in Georgia v. United States; that the protections of Section 5 are going to be available for reapportionments and the congressional purpose that's been strongly stated in the legislative history and the reenactments of Section 5, that reapportionment provides a special danger to minority voting rights and it's important that the protection be afforded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.402" offset="12154996">Now this brings me to the second interrelated pitfall that it is very important to avoid, and that is creation of a gap or a loophole in the protection afforded by one or the other of two lines of decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.394" offset="12242976">One of those lines of decisions holds that efforts by covered jurisdictions to reapportion themselves must be precleared even if those efforts occur in the course of reapportionment or other voting right litigation, that is, Connor v. Waller and related writings in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.616" offset="12355825">And the second line of decisions is that judicially imposed reapportionments need not be precleared, but they are subject to special remedial standards and those standards are protective of minority voting rights in the application, even though they are not identical to Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.029" offset="12453523">And our principle submission is that the standards for what is a legislative plan and what is a court-imposed plan should be the same for purposes of both of these lines of decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.818" offset="12516635">The Court's opinions have assumed that the standard is the same--</text>

            <text syncTime="3099.066" offset="12541712">Well, the substantive standards are a little different when you come to multi-member districts, and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="3103.502" offset="12559371">--That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.205" offset="12562192">The substantive standards are the same, but in defining what is a court-ordered plan and what is a legislative plan, as we've set out on pages 28 and 29 of our brief, opinions of this Court have assumed that you arrive at the same answer for both purposes and Congress has certainly operated on the assumption that there is not going to be a gap in protection, whereby in a covered jurisdiction the reapportionment can occur without either protection being afforded minority voting rights, and so our proposed solution, the interpretation that we espouse and that Mr. Parmley was espousing is one that we have proposed to the Court before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.418" offset="12767097">But happily, it's one that is consistent as we see it with the statutory language and with the legislative history to the extent that that legislative history specifically addresses this question and it does, in the 1975 Senate Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.439" offset="12863123">And that is that seeks to administer does embrace a proposal by the covered jurisdiction to a reapportionment court, that that court order into effect the reapportionment plan that the covered jurisdiction is in the course of litigation proposing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.119" offset="12953925">We don't think that this really should turn on the niceties of state law, about whether there is some limitation in the authority of the covered jurisdiction's body making the proposal to have enacted this change on its own in the absence of the reapportionment litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.624" offset="13039920">This would raise many uncertainties about the coverage and difficult questions of state law to be resolved in federal court which have no particular expertise about them, but the result either way would be that the covered jurisdiction would be seeking, through the approval of the reapportionment court to administer a new apportionment, precise--</text>
