            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="92065">The judgments and opinion of the Court in 79-408, the City of Milwaukee against the States of Illinois and Michigan will be announced by Justice Rehnquist.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="12.167" offset="140653">Nine years ago, Illinois brought in original action in this Court against the City of Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.629" offset="166566">We have claimed that its citizens were being harmed by discharge of inadequately treated sewage and the overflow of untreated sewage in the Lake Michigan from the Milwaukee Sewer System.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.734" offset="214945">We then decline to exercise our original jurisdiction because Illinois had available -- a federal common law action in a lower federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.356" offset="253397">Illinois then filed suit in the United States District Court in Chicago and was granted relief on the basis of that federal common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.847" offset="291432">The relief was partially affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.420" offset="309717">Milwaukee was required to take steps to control of sewers overflows over and above the steps required in permits which should been issued under the regulatory regime of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.078" offset="368336">We then granted the petition of the City of Milwaukee to review the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.684" offset="394772">When this case was first before us nine years ago and we recognize the existence of a federal common law action, we also recognize that the time might come when federal statutes would displace this federal common law remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.801" offset="455167">Today, we hope that this time has come.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.140" offset="468542">Five months after our 1972 decision, Congress substantially revised the Federal Water Pollution Control laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.554" offset="510233">Under the new system, a permit is required for every so-called point source discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.139" offset="536565">The permit subjects the discharges to the supervision of an expert administrative agency, either the Federal Environmental Protection Agency or a state agency which has been approved by the federal agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.508" offset="598005">The District Court and the Court of Appeals were therefore wrong when they granted Illinois relief premise on federal common law after Congress have enacted the detailed new system.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.878" offset="643562">Federal common law is invoked by federal courts only as a necessary expedient to resolve questions demanding federal answers which have not been addressed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.015" offset="688075">When Congress has spoken to an issue, the need for this sort of law making by the federal courts disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.601" offset="718377">Here, Milwaukee was operating a sewer system under permits issued by the State Department of Natural Resources which had been approved by the federal EPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.497" offset="757978">Its discharges were being regulated under the regime established by Congress in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.766" offset="791102">A system whereby each federal District Court establishes its own regulatory regime under the guides of federal common law is wholly inconsistent with the legislation enacted in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.337" offset="845332">Under the present system, substantive decisions about how water pollution has to be controlled are the responsibility of Congress and the administrative agencies to which Congress is entrusted this responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.792" offset="903219">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is accordingly reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.341" offset="925371">Justice Blackmun with whom Justice Marshall and Justice Stevens joined has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
