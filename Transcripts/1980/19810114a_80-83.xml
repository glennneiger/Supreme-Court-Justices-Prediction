            <text syncTime="510.529" offset="2187440">Before 1856, the first passport act, the President of the United States, the Secretary of State, and indeed other persons, including governors, mayors, and in some instances notaries public executed, issued passports, and the purpose of the Act of 1856, as we point out in our brief, was to restrict the issuance just to the Secretary of State, acting under the President of the United States, under such rules and regulations as he might promulgate.</text>

            <text syncTime="554.724" offset="2364237">That's exactly right, and except in time of war, there were few instances when it occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.045" offset="2389523">As we show historically in our brief, in the War of 1812, for example, for the first time that we could trace, a passport was required for travel control, and this applied to persons who had crossed the enemy lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.822" offset="2452635">I think this was in 1815.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.274" offset="2462457">The second time I believe it happened was at the time of the Civil War, when again a travel control statute was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.030" offset="2497461">The third time was 1918, just after the First World War, when again a travel control statute was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.486" offset="2539257">And part of our argument, of course, is that when these travel control statutes... and I could take the others from 1918.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.992" offset="2573321">There was 1941, and 1952, and then 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.293" offset="2590562">When each of these travel control statutes was passed, they assumed that the President would be issuing and refusing to issue passports, because a travel control act would make sense to require a passport if it didn't emanate from someplace, nor would it make sense if there was not the power to revoke or, indeed, to decline its issuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.379" offset="2698813">And we contend that this is evidence that the Congress intended the Secretary of State to have the authority which we insist he possessed here to revoke respondent's passport.</text>

            <text syncTime="735.876" offset="3088874">That's exactly what happened in this case when in December, 1979, just a month after the seizure of the hostages in Teheran, and after this extraordinary statement at a press conference by the respondent, the Secretary of State notified respondent that his passport had been revoked and told him that he was entitled to a hearing under the appropriate regulation, and offered to hold an expedited hearing in West Germany where respondent lives.</text>

            <text syncTime="1893.069" offset="7717667">This case does involve the constitutional right to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.591" offset="7755701">According to doctrine by this Court in Kent and Zemel, the power to issue passports is a power that ultimately is within the authority of the Congress of the United States, and Congress must authorize either explicitly or implicitly any curtailment on the right to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.402" offset="7834905">The Government, of course, concedes that there's no explicit authorization in this case, and the task of this Court is to see whether it can divine from the history presented to it by the Government and by ourselves as well whether there is any implicit authorization which has to be based as the Court held in Kent and Zemel on a substantial and consistent administrative practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.321" offset="7942634">I would like to just summarize our argument in a nutshell and then treat each of the separate arguments individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.177" offset="7982026">Our first argument is that Kent itself disposes of this case, because Kent, taken together with its companion case Dayton, in fact was a case which dealt with matters of national security and foreign policy considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.771" offset="8044407">It was not merely a case confined to speech and association, as the Government would have the Court see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.893" offset="8080874">Two, should the Court disagree with our analysis about the extent of Kent, then we can show historically that there is a total absence of any substantial and consistent practice, which is required to find that Congress implicitly authorized the regulation involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.646" offset="8191946">Both of those arguments are supported by the fact that after Kent was decided by this Court in 1958, the then Administration tried very, very hard, and very, very unsuccessfully to secure legislation which would authorize the very kind of authority which it has exercised in this case against Mr. Agee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.361" offset="8294764">And finally, looking around for what the intention of Congress actually is, we come to the amendments in 1978, substantial amendments in 1978, of Section 211(a), which is the fundamental passport authority, and Section 1185, which is the lineal descendent of all of the wartime national emergency provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3590.576" offset="14507623">Well, anyway, Mr. Wulf, you would argue that if there were explicit statutory authorization to revoke for this kind of conduct, the statute to that extent was unconstitutional because this kind of conduct has First Amendment protection?</text>

            <text syncTime="3603.884" offset="14560913">I would make that argument, but then we would deal squarely with the constitutionality in First Amendment terms of the authority which was concededly granted to the Executive Branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.625" offset="14607829">But today we don't believe that that authority exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.513" offset="14623398">I think that the 1978 amendments really settle this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.517" offset="14655372">There Congress revoked what authority this Court had given to the Government in the Zemel case regarding geographical restrictions, which certainly shows an intent to withdraw whatever authority the Executive Branch had with respect to national security and foreign policy considerations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3654.936" offset="14765086">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.971" offset="14781177">If I have 60 seconds left I'd like to call the Court's attention to two matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.225" offset="14802284">First, in response to counsel's claim about the effect and the intent of the 1978 amendments, I would refer you to page 47 of our brief, where we set forth the Senate report which makes it clear, and I read:</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.721" offset="14888279">"The Committee recognizes clearly that the passport authority should not be restricted in any way which would limit the President's ability to control the departure of United States citizens to foreign countries when such travel is inconsistent with a greater Government interest. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.167" offset="14954003">The other matter to which I would like to direct the Court's attention, if I may, is on this seven-page reply memorandum that we filed to the Petition for Certiorari, where we set forth the colloquy conducted by the court and counsel in the district court, where counsel under very careful questioning concedes that for the purpose of the determination of the validity of this regulation, he concedes that his client was causing or likely to cause serious damage to the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.292" offset="15110529">And I suggest, therefore, that he admits that he is fully within the ambit of this regulation which means that this Court needn't decide the question whether his conduct was within the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.385" offset="15174895">Of course, it leaves the constitutional question as well as the statutory authorization question to be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.323" offset="15202585">And with that, we would submit our case on the briefs.</text>
