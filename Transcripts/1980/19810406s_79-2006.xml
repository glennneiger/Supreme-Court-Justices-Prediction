            <text syncTime="10.087" offset="132424">This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.028" offset="164189">Petitioners are truckdrivers employed by the respondent trucking company.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.481" offset="193969">The trucking company does not pay its drivers for time spent conducting a pretrip safety inspection of the trucks they drive or for time spent driving the trucks that fail inspection to repair shop for repairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.971" offset="279964">The drivers' union submitted a wage claim for the driver's pretrip inspection and transportation time to a joint grievance committee for binding arbitration pursuant to a collective-bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.994" offset="344016">The joint grievance committee rejected the drivers' claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.303" offset="369302">The drivers then individually filed an action in Federal District Court alleging that the pretrip inspection and transportation time was compensable under Section 6 of the Fair Labor Standards Act or alternatively under Section 4 of the Portal-to-Portal Act Amendments to that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.248" offset="468986">The District Court dismissed the suit and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.145" offset="496571">The Court of Appeals held that the drivers' voluntary submission of their wage clam grievance to arbitration barred them from asserting their statutory wage claims in the subsequent court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.387" offset="553622">We reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.222" offset="560937">We hold that the Fair Labor Standards Act rights the drivers seek to assert are independent of any collective-bargaining rights under the collective-bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.749" offset="610987">No statutory rights devolve on the drivers as individual workers, not as members of the union and are not waivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.241" offset="652992">While Court should differ to an arbitral decision where the employees' claim is based on rights arising out of the collective-bargaining agreement, different considerations apply where the employees' claim is based on rights arising out of a statute such as the Fair Labor Standards Act designed to provide minimum substantive guarantees to individual workers as individual workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.314" offset="765319">The Chief Justice dissents and joined by Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
