            <text syncTime="21.044" offset="176206">No. 79-1033, Webb's against Beckwith comes to us on appeal from the Supreme Court of Florida and the issue is whether it is constitutional for a county to take as its own under the authority of a state statute the interest accruing on an interpleader fund deposited in the registry of the county court when at the same time a fee prescribed by another state statute is also charged for the clerk's services in receiving the fund into the registry.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.772" offset="315178">The statute which is the subject of the constitutional challenge here is Section 28.33 of the Florida statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.202" offset="344853">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we unanimously hold that the county's taking was violative of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.293" offset="381215">Neither the Florida legislature by statute nor the Florida courts by judicial decree may accomplish the result they sought simply by recharacterizing the principal of the deposited and concededly private fund as public money because it was held temporarily by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.700" offset="462822">And the earnings of the fund are incidents of ownership of the fund itself and are property just as the fund itself is property.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.238" offset="496990">And so the judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida is reversed.</text>
