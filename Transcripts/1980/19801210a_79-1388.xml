            <text syncTime="81.562" offset="459953">This case, entitled Kirchberg v. Feenstra, is a case that has gone back several years, and I would like to review some of the facts before proceeding into argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.851" offset="525050">In 1974, Mr. Karl Jean Kirchberg, my client, decided to represent Harold Feenstra, based upon charges filed by Mrs. Feenstra against Mr. Feenstra on the basis of crimes against nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.560" offset="635914">My client accepted a mortgage on the Feenstra household based upon the law existing at that time, Articles 2404 of the Louisiana Civil Code, and Articles 2334, read in pari materia.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.377" offset="747196">Thereafter, Mr. Harold Feenstra did not pay the indebtedness owed to Mr. Kirchberg, and Mr. Kirchberg, proceeding by executory process, or as it's called in the civilian phraseology, the law of Louisiana, via executiva, which is a quick seizure and sale, proceeded in the lower courts of the State of Louisiana, the civil district court in the Parish of Orleans.</text>

            <text syncTime="195.109" offset="914170">Mrs. Feenstra's counsel filed for a temporary restraining order, what we call a TRO, and finally a permanent injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.354" offset="975088">And they claim, of course, that Mr. Kirchberg was engaging himself as a creditor and money lender under the Truth in Lending Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.616" offset="1020123">Mr. Kirchberg thereafter filed in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, and the case was allotted to the Hon.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.610" offset="1072159">Judge Morey Sear, and at that time he prayed for a declaratory judgment that he had not violated the truth in lending Act, and that issue was later settled and compromised agreeable to all parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.308" offset="1130882">But Mrs. Feenstra, lo and behold, counterclaims.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.836" offset="1161080">In her counterclaim, she argues, or she claimed, that Article 2404, Louisiana head and master provision, is unconstitutional, is violative of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.391" offset="1227222">Now it is important to note that initially there was some discrepancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.467" offset="1251568">It would appear from the record that the original counterclaim was to Article 2334, was the article which was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.869" offset="1297125">However, Judge Morey Sear evidently felt that the gravamen of the complaint was Article 2404, the head and master article.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.333" offset="1342996">Thereafter, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District, Mr. Kirchberg filed a motion for summary judgment, saying that there are no material issues of fact, that indeed he should be able to proceed via executiva, and he won by way of motion for summary judgment, and Honorable Judge Sear, looking at Louisiana law and looking toward this honorable Court's guidance in Labine v. Vincent held that the motion for summary judgment would be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.019" offset="1513733">Thereafter, Joan Feenstra appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and in that decision the holding was that Article 2404 was unconstitutional, and the decision was reversed, but applied prospectively.</text>

            <text syncTime="839.555" offset="3491934">If we turn to Article 2404, we read that the husband is the head and master of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.569" offset="3524012">He manages the community, he disposes of its assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.707" offset="3544492">We read this in pari materia with Article 2334 which as originally enacted in 1962... and this is the provision that we are looking at... stated that the husband could not alienate the community immovable property where the woman, the wife, had filed a declaration of homestead in the mortgage and conveyance office where the parish, where the property was situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.678" offset="3672387">2334 was then later amended in 1977 to state that community immovable property could not be alienated unless the wife filed a declaration stating to the effect that her consent was not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.042" offset="3769876">So we're looking at earlier article 2334, valid as of 1962, valid until January 1, 1977, and we're looking at Article 2404, and we are looking at this law and we're looking at October, 1977, when these events occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.130" offset="3842183">And this is the system of law which is applied at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.457" offset="3855558">In my brief, Your Honors, we have attempted to point out the unique circumstances of Louisiana law, We have pointed to the fact that Joan Paillot Feenstra had a remedy which was a very, very easy and a very simple remedy, filing the declaration of homestead.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.895" offset="3989305">The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ignored that issue and immediately jumped to the fact that an antenuptial agreement could have been entered into between the parties before the marriage in which the parties would be separate in property or they would not have community property, or that the husband alone could not mortgage the household.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.320" offset="4110931">And they go into the point of transactional cause and the great expense of retaining an attorney before entering into marriage in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.518" offset="4171744">But the fact is that no attorney was ever needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.751" offset="4188672">The fact is that no antenuptial agreement was ever needed to remedy the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.780" offset="4212809">We're not looking at $300, $400, $500, although I do not ask this Court to take judicial notice of the amount of attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.603" offset="4256067">All we are looking at is a simple declaration, a simple, simple, very inexpensive declaration in the notarial archives of Orleans Parish and the Custodian, of the Records stating to the effect that this community house cannot be alienated or mortgaged by my husband without my consent.</text>
