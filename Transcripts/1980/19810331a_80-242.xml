            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="94.360" offset="525243">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="97.145" offset="536319">This case is before the Court on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.465" offset="565681">The question presented is whether Congress has granted a statutory right to trial by jury in suits against the Federal Government under Section 15(c) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.623" offset="614268">That Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of age in employment by private employers as well as by the Federal Government and state and local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.830" offset="655124">The first 14 sections of the Act contain the substantive and remedial provisions generally applicable to private employers and to state and local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.353" offset="693158">Section 7 of the Act deems age discrimination by these employers to be violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and provides for enforcement in accordance with powers, remedies, and procedures contained in the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.482" offset="761704">Section 7(c) then authorizes a person aggrieved by age discrimination by private employers and state and local governments to bring civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction for appropriate equitable or legal relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.757" offset="826801">Section 7(c) expressly provides for trial by jury in suits under that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.145" offset="852401">The United States is expressly excluded from the definition of the term 14 sections of the Age Discrimination act.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.303" offset="897018">Instead, age discrimination in federal employment is separately addressed in Section 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.123" offset="924290">For example, Subsection (a) of Section 15 states a distinct substantive prohibition providing that all personnel actions in the Federal Government are to be made free of discrimination on the basis of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.949" offset="979565">Subsection (b) then empowers the Civil Service Commission, now the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission after the reorganization plan, to enforce this prohibition through appropriate remedies including reinstatement or hiring with or without back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.059" offset="1039960">Section 15(c) then authorizes a person aggrieved by employment discrimination in the federal sector to bring a civil action in any federal district court of competent jurisdiction for appropriate legal or equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.736" offset="1098683">Section 15(c), unlike Section 7(c) applicable to the other employers, does not contain an express grant of the jury trial right.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.491" offset="1133687">Respondent brought this action under the Age Discrimination Act in 1978, alleging discrimination by the Secretary of Navy and certain subordinate officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.549" offset="1181962">According to the complaint, respondent's permanent position was abolished in 1975 and she worked for the next three years in another position on a continuing but temporary basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.207" offset="1228564">She alleged that officials of the Department had denied her reassignment and promotional opportunities on the basis of age during that three-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.080" offset="1272136">To remedy that alleged discrimination she sought in this case a retroactive promotion as well as an award of back pay measured by the difference between what she actually earned and what she would have earned in the Department of the Navy in the absence of the alleged discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.559" offset="1346010">Respondent demanded a jury trial on her age discrimination claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.732" offset="1374745">The Government moved to strike that demand for a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.017" offset="1387806">The district court denied the Government's motion to strike concluding that Congress intended to permit jury trials against the Federal Government under Section 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.390" offset="1429289">The district court did however certify the jury trial issue for interlocutory appeal under 28 USC 1292(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="328.728" offset="1462726">The court of appeals granted the petition for interlocutory review.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.597" offset="1478190">The court of appeals observed that the Seventh Amendment guarantee of trial by jury does not apply in this case because that guarantee does not apply in suits against the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.357" offset="1529181">The Court of Appeals also acknowledged that there is no explicit statutory grant of the jury trial right in Section 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.963" offset="1563663">Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals concluded that a right to jury trial could be inferred in Section 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.033" offset="1587904">It relied on two factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.183" offset="1596473">First, it concluded that the jury trial right could be inferred from the fact that Congress had provided for these suits against the Federal Government to be brought in federal district court rather than in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.626" offset="1646314">Second, the court found this inference from the federal jurisdictional grant in the federal district courts to be strengthened by the fact that Section 15 authorizes the court to award legal or equitable relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="398.408" offset="1741400">As I recall, the Court of Appeals did not expressly address the question of the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="415.551" offset="1809945">But it's express in Tort Claims Act, is it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="420.103" stopTime="486.647">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="420.103" offset="1828231">Well, yes, what... this is now codified in 28 United States Code 2402, that suits against the Federal Government under 1346 are to be tried without a jury with one exception, that's in tax refund suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.980" offset="1903673">But the origin of that prohibition is in the Tucker Act of 1887 and in the original Tucker Act one house of Congress had provided that jury trials, had permanently authorized jury trials in those claims that were brought in district courts at that time and as well in the circuit courts, and that one house had expressly granted it, the other House had expressly prohibited it.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.048" offset="2003983">So that it's not surprising that in resolving the disagreement between the two houses that Congress expressly resolved it and barred jury trials in suits under the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.090" offset="2048182">In fact, we believe that's strongly indicative of Congress's intent in these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.891" offset="2067304">When its attention was actually focused on the question, it resolved the question against the availability of jury trial.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="486.647" offset="2094366">But is this a suit at common law in the traditional terms?</text>
            <text syncTime="492.301" offset="2116936">Was there a suit at common law against the United States?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="498.205" stopTime="650.667">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="498.205" offset="2140551">No, there was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.938" offset="2143477">No, in that sense, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.571" offset="2150059">It was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.257" offset="2156851">This Court held a hundred years ago in the McElrath decision that the Seventh Amendment has no application in suits against the sovereign because suits against the sovereign were unknown at common law or at the very least, if they could be analogized to common law, it could not have been asserted that the jury trial right that was preserved in the Seventh Amendment contemplated a jury trial right against the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.938" offset="2255490">So it is not a suit at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.342" offset="2273148">Just to complete my answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question, in the legislative history of the Tort Claims Act Congress simply picked up the bar to jury trials that was contained in the Tucker Act and decided to incorporate it in the Tort Claims Act, and in fact in consideration of the Tort Claims Bill in 1940 in the House there was a proposal to amend the bill to allow jury trials and that was defeated, again by reference to the Tucker Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.532" offset="2421942">So the provisions barring jury trials in our view reflect that when Congress focuses on the question it decides it does not want jury trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.109" offset="2480247">We think that the court of appeals plainly erred in finding the jury trial right in Section 15 of the Age Discrimination Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.750" offset="2522775">As I pointed out, these suits are not suits covered by the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.702" offset="2542628">Respondent concedes as much and the Court of Appeals so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.587" offset="2554122">Accordingly, there can be no right to jury trial unless Congress has affirmatively recognized that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.026" offset="2583901">Respondent concedes this as well, and in fact this conclusion is compelled by Rule 38(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.079" offset="2616084">Under rule 38(a) where the Seventh Amendment does not apply there is no right to trial by jury in any civil action brought in federal district court except as given by a statute of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.173" offset="2672508">There is nothing in the text, the legislative history, or the background of Section 15 of the Age Discrimination Act to suggest that Congress intended to grant a right to trial by jury in suits against the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.199" offset="2732590">To the contrary, all the indicia of congressional intent point in the opposite direction.</text>

            <text syncTime="960.033" offset="3987930">The Court stated that in suits for legal relief, when legal issues are to be decided, the Seventh Amendment ordinarily requires a right to trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.923" offset="4039444">The Court then concluded that Congress must have been aware of this interpretation and intended that when it used the word "legal" to receive into the Age Act the jury trial right that ordinarily attaches because of the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.183" offset="4100466">That analysis, we submit, has no application here, because the Seventh Amendment doesn't apply to suits against the Federal Government, and therefore by using the word "legal" Congress could not be expected to have attached any significance to it for jury trial purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.312" offset="4169011">In fact, again, against the background of the Tort Claims Act and the Tucker Act, even in suits that are concededly of a type that would entitle a private party to a jury trial, Congress has established a different rule for suits against the Federal Government and it's consistent with this practice for Congress not to have affirmatively provided a jury trial right in suits against the Federal Government under the Age Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1246.799" offset="5135019">The only reason I mention it is because the case that seems to be principally relied upon for the proposition that providing for suits to be brought in federal district court implies a right to trial by jury against the United States was a case by the name of United States v. Pfitsch, which is, for instance, the only authority cited in the Moore treatise for that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.533" offset="5237942">But Pfitsch arise prior to the adoption of Rule 38 and its analysis was not really that the Lever Act, which was the statute involved in that case, itself contained a grant of the jury trial right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.757" offset="5286843">It seemed to be more that there was something in the nature of district court jurisdiction that provided a right to trial by jury, and we think it's clear, whatever the rule would have been before the adoption of Rule 38(a), that there is no general inherent right to trial by jury in civil actions in federal district court, that Rule 38(a) establishes a mechanism for determining when there is such a right, and, namely, whether the Seventh Amendment applies, or you have to look to the statute for a grant of the jury trial right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.430" offset="5425501">And so, to that extent I think that whatever the application of Pfitsch may have been at a prior time, Rule 38(a) requires that you look to a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.072" offset="5472104">Aside from the face of the statute itself, which as I mentioned distinguishes on its face suits against the Federal Government, I think it's also significant that there's not one mention in the legislative history of a reference to trial by jury in suits against the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.520" offset="5565831">This is... we think this silence is particularly telling against the general practice of Congress not providing for jury trials in those case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.245" offset="5608776">Indeed, the most recent situation of which we are aware in which Congress has actually granted a right to trial by jury is in tax refund suits against the Federal Government brought in federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.969" offset="5659663">Congress affirmatively granted a right to trial by jury in such suits in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.389" offset="5681292">But the House, at that time, for example, viewed this as a harmful precedent if Congress was going to provide for jury trial in suits against the Federal Government generally, and the House's resistance was sufficiently strong that it held up the reporting out of the conference committee of a bill authorizing jury trials for almost a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.703" offset="5762585">The House finally acceded to the provision in the Senate bill because of special situations involved in tax refund suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.274" offset="5792887">We think that this demonstrates that when Congress focuses on the question, at the very least it generates controversy within the Congress, and surely if Congress had intended to depart from its normal practice in the Age Discrimination Act we would expect some debate on it, instead we have silence.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="1473.697" offset="6042513">Well, I'm not suggesting that it's dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.334" offset="6061113">I do think, though, that the background against which Congress legislates in this area is at least of some relevance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.088" offset="6084100">And I also think that the manner in which Congress created a separate Section 15 also reinforces that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.028" offset="6127882">When the Age Discrimination Act was extended to federal employees in 1974, there was initially a proposal to bring federal employees in under the provisions of the first 14 sections of the Act, which incorporate the Fair Labor Standards Act procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.222" offset="6196636">As we point out in our brief, the primary basis of this Court's holding in Lorillard, finding as a matter of statutory construction a right to trial by jury under Section 7, was the incorporation of the Fair Labor Standards Act procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.165" offset="6252433">But when Congress finally enacted the 1974 amendments, it did not bring the Federal Government under the Fair Labor Standards Act procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.838" offset="6283153">As we explain in our brief, Congress instead enacted a separate Section 15 which was not patterned after the Fair Labor Standards Act, doesn't incorporate those enforcement procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.210" offset="6320665">It's instead patterned after Title VII, after Section 717 of the Civil Rights Act which prohibits other types of discrimination in federal employment, and that selection of the Title VII model for federal employees rather than the Fair Labor Standards Act model, is doubly pertinent on the jury trial question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.457" offset="6405615">In other words, not only did Congress reject the Fair Labor Standards Act model, upon which this Court had relied in Lorillard, subsequently relied; it adopted the Title VII model and the right to trial by jury has not been recognized in suits brought under Title VII, even against private employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.020" offset="6487849">So that the only inference that can be drawn from the way in which Congress structured Section 15 is that it did not intend for there to be a right to trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.328" offset="6533093">And this inference drawn from the manner in which Section 15 was formulated in 1974 was only strengthened in 1978, we submit, when Congress amended the statute in a number of respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.207" offset="6604564">First, as I have pointed out, it was in 1978 that Congress amended Section 7 to provide for the jury trial right in suits under that section and didn't under Section 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.347" offset="6649181">Beyond that, Congress enacted a new subsection (f) in Section 15 dealing with federal employment, which provides that personnel actions in the federal sector are not to be subject to or affected by any other provision of the Act except one provision in Section 12 dealing with the upper age limit for federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.130" offset="6744267">And the conference report states that this new subsection (f) makes clear that Section 15 is independent of any other provision of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.236" offset="6788675">Subsection (f) and the jury trial provision in private sector cases were both considered by the conference committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.140" offset="6820335">They were both enacted by the Congress and we submit that given this reminder, very vivid reminder in the new Subsection (f), that Section 15 is entirely separate and does not incorporate the types of procedures and remedies that are available in suits against private employers under Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.986" offset="6903718">Given that reminder that it's separate, the fact that Congress enacted a jury trial right under Section 7 and not under Section 15, we again think is very telling because it could not have overlooked, given the separate nature of these provisions, it could not have overlooked the need to amend Section 15 if it had chosen to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1729.463" offset="7065677">One, Congress had focused on the question of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.284" offset="7084904">It had considered a provision to have these cases brought under the Tucker Act and rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.704" offset="7110608">And the Court could conceive of no rational ground for doing this except to provide for jury trial rights so the rationale of Pfitsch is the Congress focused on the question, but beyond that, as I mentioned, Pfitsch also seems to depend on the notion that there is something inherent in district court jurisdiction, not on the fact that the statute granted a right, but there was a right that somehow attached because the case was brought in federal court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1790.284" offset="7308930">Well, I think one explanation for this is that at the time Pfitsch was decided there was the former 28 United States Code 770 which provided a statutory right for trial by jury in suits at law in the federal district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.498" offset="7385730">This was repealed in 1948, so it's conceivable that in Pfitsch the Court was relying on that statutory ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.086" offset="7416136">But that, as I say, that general statutory provision was repealed in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.390" offset="7437348">It was essentially unnecessary because the Seventh Amendment, in large effect it then implemented the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.644" offset="7466396">It was contained in the original Judiciary Act of 1789.</text>

            <text syncTime="1932.527" offset="7877877">I believe that the petitioner confuses the doctrine of sovereign immunity with an unproved and an unauthorized doctrine of sovereign immunity from jury trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.050" offset="7919986">Now, if the petitioner is correct that in order for a jury trial to be obtained when the Government is sued and the statute is silent, then the instructional guidance set out by this Court in Pfitsch, Law, Wickwire, and the accord in Galloway makes no sense, because in all of those instances the analysis set out by the Supreme Court was that where you had a case that was considered an action at law and there was exclusive jurisdiction in the district court, at least with respect to Law and Pfitsch, the conclusion was that Congress intended a right to jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.139" offset="8056345">Now, this is precisely what the circuit court of appeals found when it went to the language of Section 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.579" offset="8094066">As petitioner has indicated to you, there was heavy reliance by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia on the fact that Section 15(c) talks about exclusive jurisdiction in the federal district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.105" offset="8160208">The second reliance is the fact that Section 15(c) is identical in its language to section 7(c) and this Court relied upon the language, legal relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.198" offset="8212557">Mr. Justice Marshall writing for the majority in Lorillard found that the Congress is imputed with having knowledge of the well developed common law meaning of the term, legal relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.608" offset="8270236">And therefore concluded that Congress knows what it's doing when it uses certain terms and therefore on that basis as well as other bases this Court concluded a right to jury trial under 7(c).</text>

            <text syncTime="2083.457" offset="8481619">"All difficulties of construction vanish if we are willing to give to the words of Section 15, "deliberately adopted", their natural meaning. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.412" offset="8513384">I have already addressed myself to the language of the fact that legal relief is contained in Section 15(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.168" offset="8548492">And again I want to add that it states identically the same statement that is found in Section 7(c), that is a person aggrieved by age discrimination in the federal sector of employment is entitled to bring a civil action in a federal district court for such legal and equitable relief as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter, this chapter being the ADEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.868" offset="8643264">Now, petitioner claims that Section 15 is really different, that it was really modeled after Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.389" offset="8681299">Well, as, again in Lorillard, as Justice Marshall noted, Section 4 of the ADEA which contains the prohibitions against age discrimination were lifted, or derived, in haec verba, from the prohibitions found in 42 USC 2000(e)-2(a)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.487" offset="8769697">But this Court said, aside from the fact that there is Title VII overlay and that there is language found from Tittle VII, you've got to go to the remedies and procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.111" offset="8816195">And in here, in Section 15, as well as Section 15(c), there is a dramatic departure from what is found in Title VII, just as there is a dramatic departure from what is found in Title VII in the Section 7 or the other portion of the ADEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.656" offset="8886412">And what is that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.608" offset="8890174">There is an opportunity to bypass the administrative remedy set out in Section 15(b) for the federal employee and there is significantly the right to seek legal relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.047" offset="8935940">That term VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.968" offset="8955689">The only mention you have in Title VII of any description of relief is the equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.223" offset="8984633">Now, the petitioner at page 38 of his brief says that we should not ascribe or we should not impute to Congress the common law meaning of legal relief when it is found in Section 15(c) because Congress and the Seventh Amendment have always treated the issue of jury trial differently in the context of actions at law against the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.470" offset="9077628">Well, the Seventh Amendment has no applicability here because once sovereign immunity is waived that drops out of the picture, and then the ordinary principles of statutory construction obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.045" offset="9123917">And you go to the statute--</text>

            <text syncTime="2248.948" offset="9143562">--Yes, sir, and as I understand that this Court has held in Pfitsch, Law, Wickwire, and Galloway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.085" offset="9168117">Also, in the 3rd Circuit the Collins case, which I found to be a rather interesting case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.672" offset="9194448">The 3rd Circuit found that the impact of the Seventh Amendment was no longer present once the Government of the Virgin Islands had waived immunity and allowed itself to be sued in a tort action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.916" offset="9247424">Then it said it was free of the impact of the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.218" offset="9260695">Then the ordinary principles of statutory construction then became applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.772" offset="9286817">And, furthermore, in the 3rd Circuit, in that Collins case, that court of appeals concluded that there were two critical determinants present, which were the two same determinants found by the Court of Appeals here in the District of Columbia and here in Miss Nakshian's case, concluding that there was the right to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.351" offset="9365184">Now, with respect to how Congress has treated the issue of jury trials differently, I'm uncertain what is meant by that language except that there have been instances, as the petitioner has submitted in his argument, where Congress has expressly denied a right to jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.563" offset="9438014">One of them is the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.932" offset="9447522">Another is actions, all actions tried under the Tucker Act, and there is another one which is actions to quiet title found at 28 USC 2409(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.870" offset="9491304">Now, on the other hand, Congress has deemed fit to expressly grant jury trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.441" offset="9509589">Those are found in the tax refund suit and in the National War Risk Insurance Act and World War Veterans Act cases, and National Life Insurance Act cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.047" offset="9547937">But in those instances Congress was already responding to a situation in which the case law had already established a right to jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.772" offset="9586912">Now, with respect to the reliance of the Court of Appeals on the fact that there was exclusive jurisdiction in the district courts, again Pfitsch states that the nature of the jurisdiction of the district court is of importance not only because of the questions directly involved but because the answer given to it will determine incidentally whether plaintiffs who proceed under Section 10 are entitled to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.672" offset="9694432">And then it went on to hold that exclusive jurisdiction in the district court establishes as an incident a right to a jury trial, and that has subsequently been followed by other courts of appeals including the Collins case, Whitney v. United States, Hacker v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.134" offset="9764335">Now, the petitioner for the first time, before the Supreme Court argued that the language found in Section 15(f) means that the other rights, remedies, and procedures set out on the other section of the Act do not apply to actions brought by persons aggrieved by federal age discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.547" offset="9849913">Your Honors, if we follow the logic of what the petitioner is saying, we will in effect have a situation where courts will be completely left without guidance as to what the rights, remedies, and procedures are with respect to federal ADEA cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.009" offset="9927862">And why do I say that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.544" offset="9933922">According to the petitioner's arguments made in his brief as well as in his reply brief, courts would not be allowed to turn to other sections of the ADEA and to pertinent portions of the FLSA for guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.435" offset="9977495">For example, Section 4 contains prohibitions against age discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.820" offset="9995049">However, if Section 15(f) is interpreted the way the petitioner would have you interpret it, the Court can't go over this to find out what would establish a prima facie case of age discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.343" offset="10033188">Furthermore, we can't get... according to the petitioner's argument... we cannot get liquidated damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.978" offset="10055653">Federal employees or those aggrieved by the federal sector of employment could not get attorneys' fees and costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.651" offset="10082402">Now, petitioner has conceded that federal employees are entitled to liquidated damages under the FLSA, as reaffirmed in 29 USC 404(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.124" offset="10128273">However, they're saying by the logic of 15(f), you don't get liquidated damages under the ADEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.278" offset="10160874">Furthermore, even if we can assume that Section 15(f) means that the other provisions of the ADEA do not apply to the federal sector, you still have, or one is confronted with, the situation that you still have the phrase, legal relief, found in Section 15(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.876" offset="10239242">You still have Section 15(c) identical to the language of 7(c), on which this Court primarily based its conclusion that public employers and private sector employers are entitled to a jury trial right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.701" offset="10294621">Now, we content that the reason that Congress didn't bother to amend 15(c) in 1978... well, it was probably an oversight, because the main purpose of the '78 amendments was not being focused on the right of a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.830" offset="10367137">That was, as you all know, was incidentally raised October 19, 1977, when HR 5383 came over from Congress over to the Senate for deliberation, and at that time Senator Kennedy made this relatively small jury trial amendment to Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.493" offset="10449788">It is codified at Section 7(c)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.128" offset="10460237">The reason, I contend, that Congress did not bother to amend Section 15(c) at the same time is not because they were deliberately going to deny a right of jury trial to parties bringing actions involving the Federal Government, simply because it would have been mere surplusage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.240" offset="10536724">Congress didn't bother defining the prohibitions of age discrimination in Section 15; didn't bother defining the statute of limitations... that's found in 29 USC 255; didn't bother instructing the Court as to the specificity of legal and equitable relief found in Section 7(b); didn't bother telling the Government you have to post notices--</text>

            <text syncTime="2654.493" offset="10765766">They wanted to expand the rights of federal employees and in fact did so to a greater degree than they did for people covered under the other sections of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.015" offset="10799829">For example, all you have to do is be 40 and you're protected under the ADEA if you're a federal employee or a person aggrieved by the federal sector of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.221" offset="10836610">However, you do have restrictions, qualifications set out in other portions of the ADEA that we contend Section 15(f) means you don't apply it to federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.679" offset="10886451">For example, having to retire at 70 or if you're a professor, maybe teaching at NIH, you're not going to have, I think it's Section 12(c) or 12(d) applied to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.504" offset="10929815">I think that was the focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.104" offset="10940159">Furthermore, the only cases coming up at that time... you have to keep in mind, I think, Your Honor, that in 1967 the Age Act had been around for a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.358" offset="10973178">People had ripened, the courts were getting a handle on how to treat the private sector employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2764.212" offset="11204623">I think it can be distinguished here because there is the standard principle of statutory construction that says acts are construed in pari materia whenever that can be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.270" offset="11252897">And in the same fashion, I think that Congress automatically assumes that all of the other sections of the Act, 1 through 14, 16 and 17, would automatically be applied to Section 15 unless you end up with absurd results--</text>

            <text syncTime="2823.501" offset="11441815">I want to add, also, Your Honor, that while we have approached both in our briefs that, and certainly because the Court of Appeals relies on the language found in Section 15, I've seen nothing in the legislative history that indicates that Congress did not intend that the express grant found at 7(c)(2) would not apply to Section 15(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.168" offset="11552469">In fact, the 1974 amendments stated that the purpose of extending the rights of... or rather, extending the ADEA protection to federal employees was being done in the same fashion as what was being accomplished for the private sector employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.868" offset="11647242">Again, in 1978, the jury trial amendment was an incident to a much more overpowering interest on the part of Congress, and that was the mandatory retirement age, eliminating the upper age ceiling for federal employees and also trying to straighten out the 4(f)(2) defense set up by employers under the... you know, with all the involuntary retirements that were occurring under the pension benefits set out in Section 4(f)(2) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.691" offset="11778585">With respect to the legislative history, in March 15, 1974, HR 93-9113, it stated that the committee expects that expanded coverage under the Age Discrimination in Employment law will remove discriminatory barriers against employment of older workers in government jobs at the federal and local government levels, as it has and continues to do in private employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.268" offset="11952874">Now, this is important because in '74 the law was amended to include all public employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.438" offset="11977534">However, public employers were included by simply amending the definitions, I believe, found in 630.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.627" offset="12006268">Section 15 came in to give jurisdiction to the Civil Service Commission, not because there was an absolute analysis of Section 15 to Section 717, but only because the Civil Service Commission had historically had jurisdiction over all kinds of matters regarding federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.476" offset="12105638">It clearly at that time had Title VII jurisdiction and then, simultaneously in 1974, was given jurisdiction of FLSA claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.284" offset="12144926">Now, the Reorganization Act, I contend, to a certain extent has mooted that distinction, because the Civil Service Commission no longer has jurisdiction of the Title VII complaints nor of ADEA complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.793" offset="12206993">That, along with the relinquishment of the DOL jurisdiction over ADEA claims, has been sent over to the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.547" offset="12237922">One of the purposes of the reorganization plan of President Carter was that he was very concerned with the fact that there was not uniformity of result being obtained because of the different agencies' controlling or trying to administer the antidiscrimination statutes for various employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.245" offset="12324753">And he said, the reason we want to send it over to EEOC is because EEOC has a long history and expertise in administering and resolving complaints of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.101" offset="12364146">If we use the reasoning of petitioner Section 15(f), then we will obtain wholly incongruous results in that that desire of President Carter will not be met by the reorganization plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.047" offset="12431960">For the reasons that I've just stated, we will not be able to get liquidated damages, we will not be able to get attorneys' fees and costs, we will not be able to do... we will not have to do an opt-in class action, we have a different way of going under, we will go under Rule 23--</text>

            <text syncTime="3174.278" offset="12844904">With respect to the petitioner's argument presented in his brief regarding "deep pocket", I don't believe that that theory is applicable to to the instant case for the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.919" offset="12891402">In fact, an age case is the kind of case that is a well set up kind of case for juries in that juries are limited to amounts owing, which generally take the form of back pay, and liquidated damages becomes the measure of that pecuniary loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.464" offset="12969664">The trend of the case law at this time, at least with respect to the 3rd, the 4th, and the 5th Circuits, is that there is no right to compensatory or punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.903" offset="13003415">And in fact, at page 14 of the conference report, it states that the ADEA as amended by this Act does not provide remedies of a punitive nature, and that the liquidated damages become a substitute to compensate for compensatory damages that are too obscure to define in any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.633" offset="13082304">I might add that this Court unhesitatingly applied the right of a jury trial in 1978 to state employers, or to other public employers, unhesitatingly where the theory of the "deep pocket" would have as much applicability as it would in the instant case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3274.960" offset="13247607">With respect to the argument that Rule 38(a)... with respect to whether or not there was the statutory grant of the right to a jury trial, I believe that what the petitioner is arguing is that in order for 38(a) to apply in the instant case there has to be an express grant of jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.991" offset="13347708">Again, I believe that that is based, as I understand the petitioner's brief, on a presumption that there is no right to a jury trial and that again is confused with the doctrine of sovereign immunity, which again, I'd like to emphasize, drops out of the picture once the Government has consented to be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.303" offset="13420956">And then, as the court of appeals held, and as the 3rd Circuit held in the Collins case, as it was held in the Monolith case, the statutory principles, or rather the principles of statutory construction become applicable and the doctrine of sovereign immunity is no longer of any concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.533" offset="13497860">And again, I'd like to emphasize that I believe that that was the instruction set out by this Court in Law, Pfitsch, Wickwire, and Galloway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.841" offset="13543104">In conclusion, Your Honors, I'd like to state that based upon the language of the Act, as the court of appeals found by analyzing Section 15, there is an implied right of jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.672" offset="13626487">And certainly, as has been indicated in prior occasions dealing with the Federal Torts Claims Act, dealing with actions to quiet title to real estate in which the Government is a party, Congress knows how to deny a jury trial, and expressly chose not to take such a deliberate act in the case of the ADEA.</text>
