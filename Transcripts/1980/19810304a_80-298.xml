            <text syncTime="53.385" offset="362740">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="57.503" offset="379249">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.906" offset="400878">The issue involves the construction of Section 38 U.S.C. 2021(b)(3), a section of what are commonly known as the veterans's reemployment rights provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.964" offset="449048">This section, enacted in 1968, provides that reservists</text>
            <text syncTime="79.785" offset="468379">"shall not be denied retention in employment, or any promotion or other incident or advantage of employment because of any obligation as a member of a reserve component of the armed forces. "</text>
            <text syncTime="92.860" offset="520624">The facts of this case are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.295" offset="530446">Petitioner is employed at respondent's refinery in Lima, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.580" offset="547582">This refinery operates around the clock, seven days a week, three eight-hour shifts per day.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.519" offset="575272">Each employee works five days per week for a total of 40 hours, according to a rotating shift schedule that is established by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.958" offset="613097">During 1975 and 1976 petitioner was a member of a reserve component of the armed forces, which entailed certain training obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.981" offset="653117">As a general rule he was required to train with his unit on one weekend per month.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.301" offset="674433">In establishing the shift schedule, respondent took no cognizance of petitioner's training obligations and therefore petitioner was frequently scheduled to work on weekend days that conflicted with his training obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.644" offset="731798">Thus, unless he was able to arrange a voluntary exchange of shifts with a fellow employee, petitioner was unable to work 40 hours during those weeks, and respondent made other arrangements for other employees to substitute for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.320" offset="794491">As a result, petitioner lost 192 hours of work and salary over a 15-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.676" offset="823958">Now, the parties entered into a stipulation in the district court and stipulated that respondent took no steps to provide petitioner with any work hours during these weeks to substitute for those lost as a result of his military obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.436" offset="882994">Petitioner brought this suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, alleging that Respondent's failure to attempt to accommodate his reserve obligations violated his statutory rights guaranteed by Section 2021(b)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="199.195" offset="946002">Based upon a stipulated set of facts the district court granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.533" offset="975363">The court held that respondent had denied the petitioner the right to a 40-hour week, an incident or advantage of employment under the Act by refusing to take account of his reserve obligations in its scheduling.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.174" offset="1025936">On appeal the Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.959" offset="1037012">The Court of Appeals agreed that the right to be scheduled for a 40-hour work week at respondent's refinery was an incident or advantage of employment within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.148" offset="1077763">However, the Court of Appeals disagreed with the district court and with other courts of appeals as to the scope of the protection that the statute provides such a benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.622" offset="1119664">The Court of Appeals held that Section 2021(b)(3) protects reservists only against intentional unequal treatment or on-the-job bias by their employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.597" offset="1167625">However, if a reservist is denied an employment benefit because of the operation of "a facially neutral rule" that is applied uniformly to all employees, in that case, the court held that the statute is not violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.773" offset="1224258">Applying these principles to this case, the court held that respondent had not violated the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.427" offset="1250903">Petitioner's work schedule was established without regard to his training obligations and his training-related absences were treated just as other nonmilitary absences of another employee would have been treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.318" offset="1302521">Thus, in the view of the Court of Appeals, neutral treatment, not bias, was shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.555" offset="1323419">It is our contention that the principles on which the court based its decision stem from an erroneous interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.828" offset="1356542">Congress did not intend that employers would be permitted blindly to follow rules that, although neutral on their face, have an inevitable adverse effect on reservists not in situations where that adverse impact can be completely eliminated if the employer seeks to accommodate rather than simply ignore the fact of petitioner's reserve obligations.</text>

            <text syncTime="340.620" offset="1511709">Okay, well, first of all, we don't think the actual means of accommodation is really an issue in this case because the record reveals that the employer made no effort to make any arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.943" offset="1561029">Often it can be arranged simply by exchanging shifts.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.462" offset="1575030">For example, in this case, other employees had to take respondent's shift, employees that work on a so-called extra board, and there's nothing in the record that indicates why petitioner couldn't then have taken shifts caused by the extra board employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1448.694" offset="5943958">The Court of Appeals position is that the employer is entitled to rely on his rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1661.832" offset="6796594">During the course of an average year each hourly employee at Sohio's petroleum refinery in Lima, Ohio, will have seven weekends scheduled off from work, during that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.124" offset="6845705">For the other 45 weekends of the calendar year, that employee will be scheduled to work: on 30 of those weekends working both Saturday and Sunday; on the other 15 working one or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.947" offset="6897009">There is a reason why life appears to be so draconian at the refinery, and that is because, like most petroleum refineries and like many other workplaces in this country, the refinery operates seven days a week, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.428" offset="6974958">That means that on every weekend a full operating work force is required to run that refinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.249" offset="6998260">If weekends were staffed on a voluntary basis, in most cases there would be serious practical problems getting a full on a weekend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.437" offset="7039011">For that reason Sohio has developed at this refinery, subject to the collective bargaining agreement that exists with the Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers, a system of routine rotating scheduling of weekend work on an involuntary basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.249" offset="7110168">Under this system, which is set forth in the record, every employee will have on the average seven weekends off per year, that I have mentioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="2978.088" offset="12061522">You also have the fact that in another section of the same statute Congress spoke very specifically to what types of accommodation should be provided when you have a conflict between a reservist schedule and a regular work schedule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2995.531" offset="12131321">You also have a very clear legislative history of Section 21(b)(3) which shows that its purpose was to protect against discriminatory treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3060.658" offset="12391814">In our view the Congress in 24(d) specifically addressed this question, and gave very detailed, specific, and workable rules for employers to follow.</text>
