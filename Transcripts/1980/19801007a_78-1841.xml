            <text syncTime="211.351" offset="991531">Your Honor, the factual and procedural posture of the case is briefly summarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.756" offset="1025177">Respondent is a inmate confined in a Pennsylvania prison who was wanted for trial on criminal charges in the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.205" offset="1050986">He was being sought pursuant to the interstate agreement on detainers, and he alleges that this transfer under the Agreement rather than under the Uniform Extradition Act violated his constitutionally protected rights in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.293" offset="1111381">One, the failure to advise him of his right to petition the Governor of the sending state to review the custody request, and secondly, the absence of a pretransfer hearing violated his right to due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.303" offset="1167388">And secondly, the fact that the state did not provide him with a pretransfer hearing as in the case of a transfer under the Extradition Act deprived him of the equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.360" offset="1219633">The district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.311" offset="1243352">An appeal was taken to the 3rd Circuit and that court held as a matter of statutory construction, never reaching the federal issues, that Article IV(d) of the Agreement preserves a prisoner's existing procedural rights under the Extradition Act, Section 10 more specifically.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="292.553" stopTime="300.208">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="292.553" offset="1316390">Which was exactly contrary to the interpretation of the Pennsylvania state court, wasn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="maria_parisi_vickers" startTime="300.208" stopTime="535.551">
            <label>Ms. Maria Parisi Vickers</label>
            <text syncTime="300.208" offset="1347006">That's right, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.864" offset="1349618">Your Honor, in reaching their decision the appellate court relied on the language of Article IV(d) which states that the Agreement does not deprive a prisoner of any right which he may have to contest the legality of his delivery, as provided in paragraph (a) hereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.761" offset="1441151">However, nothing in the Agreement suggests that any right includes Extradition Act procedures, and it is our position that the language which I have just quoted refers only to the right to petition the Governor to disapprove the request of the prosecutor for temporary custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.750" offset="1529131">Similarly, the Court of Appeals relied on the commentary by the Council of State Governments to Article IV(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="355.544" offset="1568315">And here again they relied on language concerning extradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.528" offset="1584302">But here extradition was not defined in terms of the Extradition Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.728" offset="1605096">Therefore they relied on a commentary which was in itself ambiguous and unenlightening.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.412" offset="1639786">They also pointed to language in Article III(e) to the effect that a prisoner who himself requests final disposition on outstanding charges waives extradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.626" offset="1680642">Again, Article III does not define extradition, and there was no necessity for the framers of the Agreement to define extradition here since extradition was being waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.153" offset="1730797">So reference to Article III(e) language is also unenlightening.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.198" offset="1750963">Your Honor, this Court has defined extradition in its cases, and the Extradition Clause of the U. S. Constitution and its implementing legislation do not define extradition in terms of a pretransfer hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.830" offset="1833510">So it would seem to us that it is unreasonable to assume that every time the word extradition is used a pretransfer hearing is implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.622" offset="1880635">Neither the Extradition Clause nor the federal implementing legislation nor the definition of this Court of the term "extradition" would imply a pretransfer hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.321" offset="1931417">Your Honor, we would submit that the Court of Appeals' interpretation of Article IV(d) is not only against the clear and literal reading of the statute itself but it goes against the purpose of the Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.330" offset="1995469">And Article I, the last sentence of Article I, states that it is the purpose of the Agreement to provide cooperative procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.592" offset="2024518">The Article had been talking of the need to have cooperative procedures when there is an interstate transfer of prisoners and the framers clearly said,</text>
            <text syncTime="478.948" offset="2061925">"It is the purpose of the Agreement to provide such cooperative procedures. "</text>
            <text syncTime="483.072" offset="2078434">This language indicates that the framers intended to provide specific mechanism for these transfers; it was an affirmative statement that they were to provide certain procedures to accomplish what was to be the expeditious and orderly disposition of outstanding charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.875" offset="2153667">If the framers had not intended to set out a complete self-contained system, a complete procedure within the four corners of the Agreement, I think that they would have so specified.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.589" offset="2204553">They would have set out a particular procedure and they would not have stated in Article I that it is the purpose of the Agreement to provide the procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.665" offset="2244782">So I believe that the interpretation of the Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit goes against the clear intent set out in Article I of the Agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1331.826" offset="5473412">I don't believe that the extradition process clearly includes a pretransfer hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.714" offset="5500998">The extradition clause in the federal implementing legislation certainly doesn't require a pretransfer hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.491" offset="5528165">And there may be valid state laws which would not require a pretransfer hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.053" offset="5546346">So I don't think that it's logical to assume that extradition process means a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.176" offset="5566826">That is our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.674" offset="5572887">Your Honor, if it please the Court, the consequences of the decision of the 3rd Circuit have some very, what we believe to be some unreasonable effects and consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.948" offset="5657941">First of all, the decision provides greater procedural protections to a prisoner who is wanted for trial in another state than to the man on the street who is arrested on a Governor's warrant and is transferred to another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.816" offset="5725442">Because now you have in effect the procedures of both the Detainer Agreement and the Extradition Act which accrue to a prisoner, whereas the man in the street is simply protected by the Extradition Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.999" offset="5770163">I would submit that if there's a class of people, of the two, that needs greater protection because of the basic interest involved, I would say that the man on the street has a great deal more to lose by what could be a permanent transfer to another jurisdiction than a prisoner who is being transferred for a 120-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.068" offset="5854382">The prisoner's transfer under the Detainer Act is temporary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.690" offset="5880922">The prisoner receives substantial benefits under that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.658" offset="5896805">He may... any charges outstanding in a receiving jurisdiction which are not acted upon in the 120-day period will be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.076" offset="5934421">This is a great bonus to an inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.731" offset="5945079">Also, while he's serving the time in the demanding jurisdiction, his sentence which he was serving in the asylum state continues to be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.399" offset="5991786">He is not losing anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.538" offset="6000354">There might be interruption in his programs, perhaps he loses his job, he's away from his family, but these are minor considerations when compared to the loss suffered, the liberty loss suffered by the man on the street when he's arrested and transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.530" offset="6072243">So it is an absurd result which the 3rd Circuit decision requires, and respondent has argued in his brief that because of the evils of the detainers lodged against an inmate the prisoner requires greater procedural protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.444" offset="6155940">Well, I would submit that that is on its face a meritless conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.707" offset="6181017">And secondly, here it's not the detainer which is being attacked but the transfer itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.658" offset="6204841">Furthermore, there's the matter of the 30-day waiting period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.637" offset="6248727">This defeats one of the primary purposes of the Agreement and that is to expeditiously try the underlying specific detainer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.211" offset="6302957">This 30-day period must elapse before any procedure in court is begun, because during that 30-day period the Governor of the state may sua sponte disapprove the request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.611" offset="6352589">So therefore we must wait... now, in Pennsylvania, this is the procedure we're using... we must wait for the 30-day period to elapse, then take the prisoner before a court of record and at that point he can require a habeas corpus hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.043" offset="6410372">So that there's a great deal of delay which has been built in to the Agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2613.446" offset="10599891">This is an Act for the protection of prisoners and it's being interpreted by the State here to have taken substantial rights away from prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.175" offset="10642836">And I suggest, if that's what the Act was going to do, it would have done so very explicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.018" offset="10658196">There is no language which says there are any rights which prisoners previously had under state law that are being taken away from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.874" offset="10693618">Instead, there is Section IV(d) which says, any rights you have are preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.107" offset="10710545">Secondly, the construction of the detainer agreement within itself plainly supports this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.572" offset="10756416">You have the contrast with Article III, the prisoner-initiated transfer, in which the prisoner waives extradition... precisely the term, by the way, that's used in the Extradition Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.581" offset="10800511">Section 26 of the Uniform Act says, if you don't want to go through all these procedures, you waive extradition, you don't waive Extradition Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.985" offset="10834052">And the Extradition Act was the law of the vast majority of the states when the compact or the Agreement was drawn up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.482" offset="10864041">So they're obviously thinking in precisely those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.293" offset="10875326">They say, if you want to go to another state, you can't also ask for a bunch of rights which you may have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.712" offset="10901030">Whatever you've got, you give up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.305" offset="10907404">But by clear contrast, if a prosecutor somewhere else wants to take you across the state lines, you keep any rights you had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.192" offset="10946901">The framers sent out just a couple of pages of legislative history to go with it, and one of the things they said is, we have some questions whether we constitutionally can take away those rights or whether it's proper to take away those rights, but in any case we have clearly not done so; we've preserved whatever rights existed... not Extradition Act rights; some states didn't have an Extradition Act; then there were no Extradition Act rights to preserve; but we've preserved whatever is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.664" offset="11060795">Finally, interpreting the Extradition Act this way has the great benefit of avoiding some tough constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.816" offset="11101442">I'm assuming... and I do assume this... that this is an interstate compact and that it's subject to interpretation by this Court; then this Court has ample... the worst that could be said about the position that I'm taking is that perhaps the Act has an ambiguity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3083.245" offset="12479140">He alleges that he had an alibi witness, his mother, who would have spoken up for him, and that the New Jersey authorities carefully waited until her death and as soon as she died they filed these papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.630" offset="12540684">It's conceivable that he pleaded guilty in New Jersey, maintaining his innocence to the end but saying, my only witnesses who could have defended me are dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.658" offset="12572762">There are a lot of things that are conceivably proven in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.969" offset="12586033">I don't assume large damages, but we don't know that the damages may be nominal; under Carey vs. Piphus, whether they may be of modest substance; whether he may have suffered the destruction of a program which would have enabled him to get a prison job on which he could have made a little bit of money; you don't know what kinds of damages might be involved.</text>
