            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="163481">We will hear arguments first this morning in American Textile Manufacturers Institute v. The Secretary of Labor, and National Cotton Council v. The Secretary of Labor; consolidated cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.728" offset="238296">Mr. Bork, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_bork" startTime="21.680" stopTime="112.751">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="21.680" offset="250103">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="23.054" offset="255641">These cases are here on writ of certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.082" offset="283749">That Court upheld a health standard promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the standard specifies the maximum amount of respirable cotton dust that may be in the air of any textile plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.421" offset="341114">It is intended to reduce the incidence of byssinosis, which is a respiratory condition associated with cotton dust.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.386" offset="369012">Petitioner in one case are... American Textile Manufacturers Association or ATMI, a trade association, and 12 manufacturer members.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.083" offset="411749">Petitioners in the other case are the National Cotton Council, which represents all seven segments of the cotton industry from farmers to textile manufacturing.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.049" offset="447589">The standard is extraordinarily severe and costly; it requires textile manufacturers to reduce cotton dust within four years to.2 milligrams per cubic meter of air in all yarn manufacturing processes and to.75 milligrams per cubic meter in all weaving processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.058" offset="527628">Now this standard was arrived at by OSHA by applying their carcinogen policy, which this Court remembers from Benzene.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.493" offset="561378">The Benzene case requires that the exposure limit be set at the lowest feasible level.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.880" offset="586978">It is ironic that just two days ago OSHA rescinded its carcinogen policy.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="112.751" offset="614459">Mr. Bork, how do you define the word feasible in that statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_bork" startTime="119.561" stopTime="157.827">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="119.561" offset="641626">Well in a variety of ways, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.342" offset="656777">In the first place, my first point will be that, to find a standard economically feasible, OSHA must have an estimate of costs which is based upon substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.571" offset="713724">It must then find what those costs mean to the industry, what impact it will have upon the industry; how many jobs, how much investment will be lost because of that cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.893" offset="754998">And finally, it has to have a legal criteria by which it is able to state that the impact it finds is economically feasible.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="157.827" stopTime="163.965">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="157.827" offset="794704">And did you draw that definition from the Congressional language or legislative history?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_bork" startTime="163.965" stopTime="181.506">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="163.965" offset="819259">From the Congressional language and also it seems to me, Justice Rehnquist, that it is impossible to say that something is feasible without knowing what it will do to the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.697" offset="854263">And OSHA has made no finding here of what it will do to the industry other than to say that some undefined number of plants may close.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="181.506" stopTime="187.987">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="181.506" offset="889476">Well, and that the industry as such would not go... not cease to exist?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_bork" startTime="187.987" stopTime="215.211">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="187.987" offset="915390">The industry as such, Justice Stewart, will not cease to exist is all they have said.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.500" offset="933466">That finding is thoroughly consistent with 90 percent of the industry being left, or 50 percent of the industry being left, or 10 percent of the industry being left.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.246" offset="972441">In fact, the literal language that OSHA uses would be satisfied if there were a single mil left.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.682" offset="998145">That standard of the industry will continue to exist is not a standard at all.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="215.211" stopTime="217.882">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="215.211" offset="1024268">But it is the one that OSHA applied?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="217.882" offset="1034926">That's the only one, that's right, Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.740" offset="1042345">And one of our contentions is that that standard, if that is considered to be a standard, means that nobody knows what OSHA is doing; judicial review is impossible, and you have the completely uncanalized power over industry that this Court found improper on the benefit side of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.622" offset="1121966">Here, they are claiming the same power through their power to impose costs without limit, or without any real limit.</text>

            <text syncTime="357.340" offset="1592797">However, one thing is clear; that Congress in the OSHA act did not intend just to shut down industries, because they required that the standard be economically feasible.</text>

            <text syncTime="375.348" offset="1664790">My understanding of the act was that Congress had delegated to the executive branch the accomplishment of these particular results.</text>

            <text syncTime="407.850" offset="1794880">So while Congress may have the raw constitutional power to do that, it is perfectly clear that in this statute it has not done that.</text>

            <text syncTime="600.976" offset="2567373">The first one is economic feasibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.240" offset="2580434">And as to that, my point is that three things are required.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.895" offset="2594959">As I said, an estimate of costs based upon substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.410" offset="2613035">Our point here is that the estimate of costs is based upon no evidence, it is pure conjecture.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.719" offset="2634351">But the second two elements of economic feasibility aren't even present here, and that is, what do those costs mean for the industry, how much of this industry is going to be destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.575" offset="2673744">That isn't even addressed here, except to say the whole industry won't be destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.886" offset="2690985">And thirdly, there is no criteria of any sort; no policy judgment, no articulated policy judgment, nothing as to why whatever percentage of the industry is going to be destroyed should nevertheless be considered a feasible policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.661" offset="2750021">So that, two of the three elements which are inherent and inevitable in any finding of economic feasibility simply aren't present here, and that fact alone, I think, requires reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.889" offset="2802998">Additionally, there is no substantial evidence to support the cost for the bases, so that we have economic feasibility requiring three elements, not one of which is present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.633" offset="2869976">And the government's brief I think, quite understandably, attempts to obscure this point which is present in our main brief, by speaking as if we are only arguing about the substantial evidence supporting the cost estimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.299" offset="2924624">We are not only arguing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.737" offset="2930371">We are also arguing that the other two elements which are required for any sensible judgment of economic feasibility aren't even addressed at this point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2095.938" offset="8547220">I wanted to say about the second part of Petitioner's argument, the substantial evidence, that we think the Court of Appeals correctly analyzed that factual question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.685" offset="8582119">But I do want to point out that Professor Bork is incorrect in saying that the cotton dust standard was issued pursuant to any sort of carcinogen policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2117.821" offset="8634678">It was issued pursuant to substantial evidence of a significant health risk at the current exposure level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.613" offset="8665920">The pre-standard current exposure level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.112" offset="8683892">There were 105,000 pages of record in this case, and they pointed conclusively to a substantial risk of material health impairment at the 1,000 microgram level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.156" offset="8720046">Dr. Merchant produced a dose-response curve, it was not subject to serious challenge at the administrative hearing, showed that at that level 26 percent of the workers would be exposed to some risk of byssinosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.150" offset="8776052">Also showed that at the level that the Secretary proposed that risk would be cut in half, to 13 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.929" offset="8807190">There's no question in this case we think, both that the Secretary satisfied the Benzene standard, and that he issued the standard pursuant to substantial evidence of the significant health risk that the standard would reduce, not pursuant to any so-called policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.827" offset="8870720">This is just another industry red herring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.327" offset="8880751">Now Professor Bork made another... a number of other misstatements about the record that are purely factual.</text>

            <text syncTime="2191.292" offset="8928608">I don't think it's very useful here to replay the evidentiary disputes that the Secretary resolved and that the Court of Appeals found were supported by substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.100" offset="8967791">The respirators are not feasible, the record quite clearly shows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.240" offset="8988376">Secondly, the industry's approach in this case, and certainly the basis for the so-called ATMI alternative was this notion that the low-grade of byssinosis were no more damaging than the common cold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.624" offset="9037904">That's absolutely incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.202" offset="9044278">There was substantial evidence in the record of material health risk even at low levels of byssinosis, and more important, the Secretary found that it's a continuum of disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.887" offset="9082939">Dr. Harley, the industry's main witness, testified that byssinosis is a continuum of disease, but it doesn't progress in a rational fashion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3714.602" offset="15021825">And I want to just carry that point one step forward, Mr. Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.085" offset="15035723">If you... reading the industry position knowing as they come before the Court and tell you, that it doesn't require valuing human life, there's only one way to get away from that proposition and they try to get away with it by saying what the Secretary should be doing in setting a standard for one toxic substance, is to compare what the risk is going to be for other potential hazards, what the technological feasibility will be for all of those other hazards, what the cost of compliance will be for all of those hazards, and in that nice, simple, little package, says the ATMI, we have offered a "feasible solution" to ways this statute should be interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.068" offset="15211683">Now that in our judgment, in effect, would be asking the Secretary of Labor, in the name of doing something, to do everything, he would have to inventory the entire list of every single potential toxic substance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3811.315" offset="15408647">We have much clearer guidance from Congress than the discussion and rhetoric that's gone back and forth here in Court today, and our brief spells out what that discussion was and what those concerns were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.887" offset="15471027">Now I know we've got a hypothetical, but let me stay with the concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.244" offset="15484402">The concern was that small employers particularly, were not devoting the necessary capital investments in order to provide safe and healthy work places.</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.582" offset="15533721">Congress understood this was a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3844.535" offset="15541558">This is not a problem that's just emerged in the context of the cotton dust case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.674" offset="15558172">And Congress said, we are going to insist on a uniform, nationwide approach; we're going to compel each and every employer to meet these standards because if we don't go that way we're never going to get it, the ultimate protection that this statute is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.120" offset="15631941">Congress went further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.917" offset="15639047">They also understood, and there's been discussions here of who would go out of business?</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.695" offset="15654198">Well we're way removed from that problem in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.241" offset="15664438">As a matter of fact, in the Court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals opinion says that the American Textile Manufacturing Industry concedes that at 550 million dollars there's no economic feasibility problem insofar as the entire industry as a whole is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.750" offset="15734446">But getting back to my point, Mr. Justice Rehnquist--</text>

            <text syncTime="3916.087" offset="15827755">Not only was the judgment uniform, nationwide, small employers, but there is a recognition that this would well or might well have a severe impact on small employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.894" offset="15878955">That was not something that comes out of the blue; that was a major subject of concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.376" offset="15900898">Senator Dominick repeated that concern, but what was the solution?</text>
            <text syncTime="3939.250" offset="15920438">Was it to carve out or exempt the small marginal employer?</text>

            <text syncTime="3943.498" offset="15957114">Was it to dilute the protection of the statute as to workers in those plants?</text>
