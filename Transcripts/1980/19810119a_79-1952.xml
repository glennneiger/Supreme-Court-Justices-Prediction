            <text syncTime="66.082" offset="356331">It comes to this Court on appeal from an en banc decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals which sustained the validity of the $5000 calendar year limitation on contributions to a political committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.125" offset="420487">The case comes here by way of the unique judicial review provisions contained in 2 U.S.C. 437h, which provide for the filing of actions to construe the constitutionality of the Act and for the certification of those actions to the Court of Appeals with ultimate review on appeal in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.907" offset="515678">Appellants challenged that aspect of the $5000 calendar year limit which restricts the administrative support and unincorporated association may contribute to its political committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.385" offset="569594">Appellants claim that the $5000 limit violates the rights under the First Amendment and that the statutory scheme, which allows corporations and labor organizations to contribute unlimited amounts of administrative support to their political committees violates the equal protection rights of Appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.781" offset="659142">The term “administrative support” as used by the parties and the court below refers to anything of value used for the purpose of establishing, administering or soliciting contributions to the political committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.129" offset="720582">The Appellant, California Medical Association, is an unincorporated membership organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.590" offset="742420">Its membership consists of approximately 25,000 physicians who practice in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.859" offset="767498">The CMA sponsors a political action committee known as the California Medical Political Action Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.579" offset="794352">CALPAC receives in kind administrative support from CMA.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.238" offset="817026">CALPAC also receives contributions from physicians who choose to contribute to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.456" offset="845865">CALPAC supports candidates who run for federal office among other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.081" offset="868331">Appellants, Foster and Rose are members of both CMA and CALPAC.</text>

            <text syncTime="1745.836" offset="7075338">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.393" offset="7089549">There are two matters here, the jurisdictional matter and the substantive regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.439" offset="7117761">While I will try and use the majority of my time to deal with the substantive regulation, I would like to spend a few minutes on the jurisdictional question because it is something that I think has caused great difficult to the Courts of Appeals below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.154" offset="7172618">The question is really, one, I think of -- of statutory interpretation of the proper interpretation of 2 U.S.C. 437h.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.588" offset="7206368">We urged upon the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit as we have urged on other Circuits that that statute should be narrowly construed, that the words in that statute as may be appropriate to construe the constitutionality of the Act do not mean that any question certified up to the Court must be dealt with, with the very extraordinary provisions that 437h provides, not only of en banc hearing in front of the Court of Appeals, but then of direct route -- right of appeal to this Court in -- in an error of course when there has been at least in other instances some indication of trying to limit that kind of direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.619" offset="7358505">So we have urged that there should be a narrow interpretation of that -- of -- of that phrase as may be appropriate and that in circumstances such as this case here, where there was already a proceeding which had commenced in front of the Commission, that it was not appropriate for the Court of Appeals to hear -- to hear that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.165" offset="7432693">The Court of Appeals took what seems to have been a middle course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.807" offset="7447217">They asked us, as noted in the record, that the parties addressed the question of the constitutionality of the requirement that they sit en banc and then, at least, in our opinion, did not sit pursuant to 437h because they specifically said that they would not follow the requirement set forth in the statute that -- by Congress -- that they be required to sit en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.810" offset="7539273">There is -- I do not want to go through the various cases that have dealt with 437h because they have been set forth at length in our brief and in our opponent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.733" offset="7578979">I would like to call attention to the case that was just recently decided last week on January 15th in FEC versus Lance, which is cited at page 15 of our brief, note 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.231" offset="7628925">There, in a subpoena, that was the case in which the Commission had brought an enforcement of some subpoena action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.345" offset="7653376">The subpoena was enforced early in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.096" offset="7668422">The Court of Appeals stayed that action and stayed that action pending hearing on the defenses that had been raised, including constitutional defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.092" offset="7704367">A panel decision was rendering saying that the subpoena should be enforced, that it did not find the defenses acceptable, but that due to the presence of 437h, they felt that the constitutional defenses raised as a subpoena should be certified to the en banc Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.913" offset="7767687">The en banc Court of Appeals, in the decision that was rendered last week, following the Ninth Circuit, indicated that it felt that due to the same kinds of considerations that had bothered the -- the Ninth Circuit, that it should hear that case pursuant to Rule 35.</text>

            <text syncTime="2726.250" offset="10997049">That as applied is really remitted by the statute to the advisory opinion proceedings in the 437g enforcement proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.991" offset="11027978">I would note from -- in contrast to when -- when the statute was before this Court in Buckley that the advisory opinion section of the statute has been altered in 1979 amendments to allow any person to require the Commission an interpretation on any transaction they're involved in so that in -- in vagueness terms, the problem that the Court there was concerned with has to some extent been mitigated by the fact that there is an advisory opinion proceeding where the Commission can indicate its -- its interpretation of the law so that that -- that in -- that in effect, I think that the -- those proceedings in front of the Commission are -- are adequate to take care of as applied situations as opposed to facial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.413" offset="11189728">I would like to turn to the substantive issue here raised because it seems to be one of considerable importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.966" offset="11227867">Basically, the underlying thrust of the entire statute, which I think that Appellants here do not really contest is that the Congress had a right to battle the perception that sizable campaign contributions channeled through various sources should not be perceived that the appearance cannot be there that sizable campaign contributions, not the public interest is what controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.142" offset="11332566">In effect, they do not really challenge the overall interest in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.246" offset="11353046">The real -- the real challenge, it seems to me, is to the -- is to the extent of the limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.501" offset="11378019">They argue that the statute sweeps too broadly that the statute, could and does, in more limited means, achieve the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.284" offset="11425144">The question there, it seems to me is -- is what interests are at stake?</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.995" offset="11439981">You have in effect a statute which seeks to protect the public interest against the corrupting power of money in elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.204" offset="11472791">On the other side, you clearly have important individual interests at stake, individual interest in speech and individual interest in association, and those are very precious individual freedoms.</text>

            <text syncTime="2932.223" offset="11820951">Congress could, and this is quoting from page 30 of Buckley, provide that the opportunity for abuse inherent in the raising of large contributions could be controlled by contribution limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.395" offset="11869643">And at page 38 of that opinion, in validating the $25,000 limitation, that same language was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.767" offset="11899109">And what Congress did in 1976, following the Buckley decision in its attempt to try and put the statute, to enact the statutes back after the -- to reenact the Commission, et cetera, what it did was to say that -- well, what we see is the possibility that if you do not put a limitation on contributions by persons to committees, that you will have inherent in that, a system where there will be many more committees, where -- where committees either by direct or indirect means, people will not be abiding by the contribution limits because they will be able give amounts to this committee, amounts to another committee because persons, unlike individuals, are not limited so that association such as -- as CMA could give $5000 to -- could give unlimited amounts without the $5000 limits to as many committees as they wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.294" offset="12113209">And that while there are in the statutes, the narrow prescriptions which Mr. Zimmerman has referred to, 441a(a)(7), 441a(a)(8), 441a(a)(5), limiting conduits, limiting making as a contribution anything done in coordination with candidates and limiting the proliferation of committees that the very thrust of the Court's reasoning in upholding the contributions limit previously was that Congress did not need to rely on those prohibitions, that the -- that the contribution limit served an independent purpose by -- as the quote says, “avoiding the opportunity for abuse inherent in the raising of large contributions.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3077.733" offset="12402959">That the history of the statutes before 1971 and the history of the hearings particularly, I think, in the 47 hearings are full of the instances that by creating a -- a variety of committees that the then existing limitations were avoided, and that -- so I think that there is a very distinct constitutional limit -- a constitutional underpinning for the limitation of the proliferation of committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.236" offset="12500971">I would like to turn momentarily to the chores that there is discrimination here, in the sense that the provision limiting unincorporated associations, all persons to $5000 discriminates in a way against -- against those organizations because corporations and labor organizations, which are separately regulated and have been again since 1907, are permitted to use their internal funds for the cost of the administrative cost, the -- the very argument that is here made by the Appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.758" offset="12651018">In effect, it seems to me that that is a question of classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.333" offset="12669408">The Congress, over the course of -- since 1907, as the first statute, again I would not go back through all the history of -- of these statutes because I think it's set forth in -- in the -- the great trilogy of cases of U.S. versus CIO, the UAW case and then the Pipefitters case of the -- of the evolution of these statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.108" offset="12744432">But the provisions now in 441b, back then in 18 U.S.C. 610, are really a product of the dialogue between this Court and Congress, where Congress having put a total prohibition on corporations and labor organizations, having concluded that those organizations, because of their direct relationship to the economy, deserved specialized treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.665" offset="12846727">Having put that total prohibition on was worn by this Court that that prohibition could not be used as a means of keeping the organization from fostering its communication to its members and the fostering its legitimate purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.639" offset="12906600">So that you have there a compromise that was worked out back and forth, of course, majorly in the Hansen Amendment which was indirectly before this Court, but heavily covered in the Pipefitters decision, saying that the prohibition of direct contribution to the prohibition of making direct expenditures in -- in elections is balanced in the statute by provisions that specifically provide for communication and specifically resolve the then unanswered question under the previous statute of that one of the matters that could be done, was to provide for this kind of administrative support.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.719" offset="13058946">To suggest as the dissent below does, and as I think Mr. Zimmerman does in his argument, that because Congress, in making that balancing out, has allowed corporations and labor organizations to spend those administrative expenses, that that is a benefit that can be seen apart from and distinguished from the overall total scheme of regulation, which substantially prohibits corporations and labor organizations in a way that no other persons are, is to suggest, I think, as the -- as the court -- majority of the court below indicated is to suggest a false question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.312" offset="13205232">Because in effect, the classification -- I think that the -- the classification of corporations and -- and labor organizations would even withstand strict scrutiny, but I don't think that this Court, in looking that, has ever even thought that strict scrutiny applied to such a classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.832" offset="13271374">But those organizations, what they do is really an offshoot of their economic interest and that very powerful, very strong economic interest is what has led to the congressional regulation of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.288" offset="13369176">In effect, to sum up the Commission's argument on the -- on the statutory issue, it seems to us that the $5000 limitation on contributions, five times that which could be given to, by an individual to a candidate of his choice, where that was spoken of, as or be it a limitation on the matter of First Amendment values was a -- a limitation that was on speech, that was not direct speech, but was really speech that was only -- what -- what was less direct than the independent expenditures issue, and the same limitation on the $25,000 that the $5000 limitation on contributions to political committees serves the same purposes and falls well within the parameters of this Court's decision on contributions in Buckley versus Valeo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.557" offset="13570215">Similarly, I think this Court should reject the argument that because Congress, in adhering to the expressed doubts on the constitutionality of the structure of 610 and now 441b, had worked out a special system of regulation that you would find invidious discrimination because of that careful constitutional balancing, which Congress went through in response to this Court's decisions.</text>
