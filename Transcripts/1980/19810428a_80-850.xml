            <text syncTime="69.094" offset="416706">The question presented is whether, under the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution, a state in furtherance of its interests in protecting its children and enforcing its criminal law may enact a statute which provides that a person who commits the crime of child abandonment and leaves the state is guilty of a felony, whereas a person who commits the crime of child abandonment without leaving the state is guilty of a misdemeanor.</text>

            <text syncTime="120.310" offset="621506">Appellee's challenge and the court of appeals decision is predicated on the ground that the statute distinguishes between two classes of abandoning parents, based upon the exercise of their constitutional right to travel, and that therefore the statute is void under the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.124" offset="704784">Appellee is a father who was ordered by a Georgia court to make child support payments but who never did, who simply went to Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.260" offset="737280">He testified that he did not go to Alabama for the purpose of avoiding his child support obligations but rather to attend school.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.918" offset="775941">When he returned to Georgia to visit his child he was arrested on the warrant for the felony of abandoning his child and leaving the state, and received a three year sentence suspended on condition that he make child support payments, which he never did.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.047" offset="848457">Instead he just left the state again.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.363" offset="857757">He eventually became a resident of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.134" offset="872803">Upon his wife's death he regained custody of his child, but he had some problems with the Florida authorities and moved back to Augusta, Georgia, where the child had to be placed in the Department of Family and Children Services custody, basically a welfare agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.762" offset="943334">And thereafter, the appellee was arrested on an outstanding bench warrant and sentenced to serve three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.799" offset="975517">After having exhausted his state remedies, the appellee filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia alleging that the statute violated his constitutional right to travel and was void under both the Equal Protection and the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.747" offset="1067259">The district court ruled against the appellee but upon appeal to the 5th Circuit the district court's order was reversed and judgment entered for appellee.</text>

            <label>Ms. Carol Atha Cosgrove</label>
            <text syncTime="314.135" offset="1396820">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.635" offset="1402776">I believe only in the First Amendment area has there been a chilling and an overbreadth problem addressed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.391" offset="1437884">The court of appeals reasoned that inasmuch as the appellee did have a fundamental right to travel, that the statute was the subject of strict scrutiny; and secondly, since Georgia has no compelling state interest involved, that the statute would be violative of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.590" offset="1530671">The court of appeals also reasoned that the statute was overly broad in that we had the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, URESA, which was available to vindicate any of Georgia's interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.668" offset="1598903">Appellant appealed that decision on September 19, 1980, and this Court noted probable jurisdiction on January 26, 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.757" offset="1639341">There are two issues before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.457" offset="1650103">First, whether parents who commit the crime of child abandonment do have a fundamental right to travel in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.663" offset="1682913">And secondly, if such a right does exist, whether Georgia's child abandonment statute impermissibly penalizes that right without being justified by compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.388" offset="1737874">Now, turning to the first issue, it is Georgia's position that the fundamental right to travel, to migrate, to settle in other states, was never intended to encompass and protect the criminal's right to avoid the consequences of his own misdeeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.819" offset="1819586">Whatever the constitutional rights of criminals in other contexts may be, their rights to full and free travel are attenuated.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.175" offset="1860963">For example, if a person commits a crime, just leaves the jurisdiction, even without intent to avoid prosecution, he is nevertheless subject to mandatory extradition proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.053" offset="1928464">And in addition, many states including Georgia have statutes of limitations which are tolled the instant a person leaves the state, thus dramatically increasing the time period during which a person may be punished for a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.681" offset="2002965">So, since we do not believe that there are any fundamental rights involved in this case, we submit that it is the rational basis test that should be applied to this statute and that the statute easily passes that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.340" offset="2061688">As this Court has noted, it is the state legislature which is preeminently responsible for defining, and punishing crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.815" offset="2103589">And we submit that the state legislature could rationally have decided that a person who commits a crime, in this instance the crime of child abandonment and leaves the state makes it much more difficult for the state to bring him to justice, that that person deserves a more stringent punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.031" offset="2204421">However, even if strict scrutiny test were to be applied, as appellee urges, we submit that the statute would also pass muster under this more exacting standard, for it is not every constitutional infringement, of course, that is barred, it's only those which rise to the level of penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.065" offset="2300552">It's our position, of course, that this statute in no way penalizes the right to migrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.385" offset="2325839">Indeed, if it has any effect at all upon the right to migrate and settle in other states, that effect is purely incidental and remote.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.977" offset="2380173">For under the statute a parent is free to move to any state he wishes, stay as long as he wishes, and the statute has absolutely no impact upon him at all unless he has committed the crime of child abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.806" offset="2455510">So this statute is unlike provisions which this Court has struck down in, for example, Crandall v. Nevada, a taxing provision that reached everyone who left the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.448" offset="2510054">This statute is narrowly tailored to reach only those persons who have committed a crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="659.992" offset="2780265">Rather, this statute impacts on the most blameworthy persons, those parents who abandon their helpless children.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.733" offset="2827181">So we feel that this statute no more penalizes parents who simply wish to go to another state than does the existence of an extradition law or an indefinite statute of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="745.531" offset="3122364">Of course, even if the Court were to see this as somewhat of a penalty upon the constitutional right to travel, it's Georgia's position that the statute is more than justified by our compelling interest in protecting our children and enforcing our criminal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.442" offset="3194044">And this interest in protecting our children appellee does not even dispute, and it is manifested in at least two other statutes which make this same felony misdemeanor distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.452" offset="3254126">For example, we have a statute which makes it a felony for a husband to abandon his pregnant wife and leave the state, whereas if he stays in the state, it is a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.845" offset="3307625">And similarly, we have a statute which makes it a felony if one is to interfere with the custody of a child who is committed to the legal custody of another, and then to take that child out of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.254" offset="3365303">And again, interference with the custody of a child within the state is only a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.908" offset="3391948">So, I think the Court can see that Georgia is fairly consistent in this design to protect its children.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.947" offset="3432072">Turning to the interest in protecting our criminal laws, practically speaking, when a criminal leaves the jurisdiction, Georgia, just like every other state, is dependent upon extradition to get that person back to face trial or to serve his punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1044.042" offset="4316474">But the court of appeals used as an example of the overbreadth that we did have this alternative means available to us, and I think, quite honestly, that this alternative means simply is not effective for under the version of URESA which has been adopted by approximately 10 states, there is a provision by which an absent parent can totally avoid extradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.699" offset="4459102">He simply submits himself to the jurisdiction of the court of the responding state and agrees to pay some child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.204" offset="4493061">And he never comes back to Georgia, he never sees the inside of a jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.906" offset="4507899">For the remaining states which do not have that automatic avoidance of extradition, many of them nevertheless have a discretionary section which says to the governor of the responding state, basically, if there has not been a URESA petition filed, you don't have to extradite this person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.957" offset="4608105">You can require a URESA petition to be filed first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.259" offset="4621270">And secondly, if there is an outstanding order of some type in existence and the absent parent is complying with that order, then the governor can also just refuse to extradite that person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.370" offset="4689711">I think if we were to follow the court of appeals decision in this case, we could conceivably have a situation where a person abandons his child in Georgia, goes to another jurisdiction, and even if the custodial parent... and I might add, it is usually the custodial parent which files a URESA petition... even if that custodial parent were successful in getting that absent parent into the court of the responding state, it is more likely than not that he could totally avoid extradition by simply agreeing to pay child support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.714" offset="4859089">And the difficulty with that... you know, one might say, well, he's paying child support, that ought to settle the problem... the difficulty is that the duty of support which URESA contemplates is not the duty of support which obtains in the demanding state, in Georgia, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.361" offset="4937770">It would be the duty of support imposable under the laws where the absent parent was, and that's presumed to be the responding state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.734" offset="4975177">So we can have a situation where the absent parent comes into court, he agrees to pay child support, he may well be a respected member of the community by now, and the court simply will not impose a large amount of support on that absent parent, and thus really defeating the order of the Georgia court, and also not meeting the needs of the child.</text>

            <text syncTime="2623.863" offset="10635703">Let me jump ahead to the strict scrutiny analysis which I hope we reach somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.469" offset="10666110">But if you figure that we've got a constitutionally protected right to travel here, then under the familiar formulas of this Court, it would fall strict scrutiny, and I don't mean to repeat it for your edification, but for mine, that would mean that the state would have to show that it's reasonably necessary to promote a compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.864" offset="10739775">The state basically, their interest here comes down to extradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.085" offset="10760568">When you look behind everything they can say about the welfare of the child and about the enforcement of the criminal law, on both avenues it boils down to aiding extradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.556" offset="10802469">But the only... the thing is that that's not necessarily compelling interest because we've got the Extradition Clause of the Constitution, we've got the Federal Extradition Act, we've got URESA, we've got uniform reciprocal... whatever it is... uniform criminal extradition act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.568" offset="10874567">All of these serve, they completely serve that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.554" offset="10886479">As a matter of fact, under the last two, Bobby Helms need not ever have even been in Georgia, much less have been a fugitive from Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.324" offset="10913541">Under all law, the caliber of the crime, the fact that it's a misdemeanor, not a felony, doesn't prevent extradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.913" offset="10947919">He's extraditable under all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.431" offset="10958054">Elevating it to a felony doesn't apparently aid the state's interest one bit except for the argument they make that governors will treat this offense more seriously and everything if it's a felony, which is a pretty good argument if you want to make the whole crime a felony, but it's not a pretty good argument for the distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.229" offset="11033182">The state fails on the necessity aspect of that strict scrutiny test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.201" offset="11077068">Looking at it simply under URESA and everything else, it's just not necessary, and it can't promote it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.404" offset="11101937">Even if it were a felony and the state proceeded under URESA, they would still encounter those relief provisions that the state talked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.646" offset="11138821">A judge in Alabama could still... or, a judge in another state, by entertaining an action brought by the father over there, could completely bar extradition under URESA, regardless of whether it's a felony or misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.322" offset="11201515">But in any event URESA is designed to be a supplementary kind of extradition procedure, not one that necessarily preempts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.312" offset="11241535">I forget exactly what section of URESA it is, but the state's perfectly free to proceed under all its other extradition powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.017" offset="11272359">And again, under all of those extradition powers whether the thing's a felony or a misdemeanor, they still run into the governor's discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.804" offset="11299527">And making it a capital felony is not necessarily going to elude that governor's discretion.</text>
