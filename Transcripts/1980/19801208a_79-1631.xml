            <text syncTime="1504.941" offset="6168510">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.986" offset="6184601">At the outset I want to make a correction on the factual circumstances concerning the Montana presidential primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.201" offset="6229532">This is contained in the amicus brief of the state of Montana and the state of Washington on page 3, I believe it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.777" offset="6259834">There, the procedure for the Montana primary is set forth and under Montana law, each political party has the right to choose its method for selection of delegates and under that law in 1980, the democratic party of Montana chose to select its delegates through the open primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.280" offset="6369861">And as stated there, that's a policy which also violates the rules of the Democratic National Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.384" offset="6414270">So Wisconsin is not the only court... excuse me, the only state that has... is subject to the rule of... in conflict with state law in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.317" offset="6461917">I will address the impact of the party rule upon the state electoral and political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.720" offset="6507579">Wisconsin voter surveys indicate that the largest class of party identifiers in Wisconsin as well as in most states of the country identify themselves as political independents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.542" offset="6562854">At stake here is the impact of the rule upon independents, Republicans, minor party adherents and others who value their privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.909" offset="6636310">What are their rights under the party rule?</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.767" offset="6659716">There are absolutely none.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.672" offset="6667344">On the other hand under the authority of Article II, Section 1, Wisconsin law recognizes and protects their rights to participate in the candidate selection process leading to the election of the highest office in the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.431" offset="6742472">And it protects those rights to participate in a free and open manner without a declaration of party loyalty as a condition of exercising the basic right of all, which this Court has held to be the root of all basic rights, the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.812" offset="6827945">What are the interests that the Wisconsin open primary serves?</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.669" offset="6855321">It's important to note that the direct primary, Wisconsin being the first state to enact such a law in 1905, was a reform effort to cleanse the political process, which up to that time had been dominated by special interests who controlled the selection of candidates through the political caucuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.939" offset="6960438">These privacy interests are eloquently stated by the amicus brief of Washington and Montana, and the brief of Editor Maraniss, I won't go into them here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.949" offset="7024490">This interest broadly serves the expansion of the franchise, it encourages I voting, and it works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.631" offset="7063256">Wisconsin has been in the top three of voter participation turnout in the presidential elections in this past decade.</text>

            <text syncTime="1828.717" offset="7463556">And of course we must remember, and I think it's important to distinguish, the types of political activities that a party engages in.</text>

            <text syncTime="2106.978" offset="8576581">The... probably the issue involved in that case, involved the affirmative action rules of the parties as far as slate-making, as far as age, race, sex; those kinds of qualifications were at issue in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.532" offset="8662786">And there was an intervention by a state court, telling the party and the delegates who were chosen by private caucuses pursuant to party rules, that met all of these qualifications that those folks couldn't go to the Democratic National Convention as delegates because these other folks were elected under state law and state law prevails.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.929" offset="8760379">Now as far as voting qualification... there's one thing that hasn't been said yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.036" offset="8788800">And that is that under Wisconsin direct open primary, we vote for candidates, we vote for President, we vote for the names on the ballot in the Wisconsin Democratic Party... are the party of candidates for President.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.920" offset="8848359">We are not talking about a process under state law which selects the delegates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.635" offset="8875213">Under the state law the delegates are selected after the primary is over with, by the state party, under state law they must be party members, they must be... they must take, the only issue that the party has, is that they must take a pledge under state law to vote in accordance with the apportionment that are the results of the primary election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.388" offset="9002273">That is the only thing that the party disagrees with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.184" offset="9025470">Otherwise, these folks comply with state law, they are chosen by the party, and the only interference by this Wisconsin Court order, which is the narrowest that could possibly be drawn in order to effectuate the purpose of the primary which is to guarantee the vote of those people that went into the privacy of their voting booth and voted for those particular candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.250" offset="9141662">And we feel that Cousins is not applicable here, and in fact, we would draw your attention to Buckley v. Valeo which is, we feel, much more in point as far as the constitutional issues that are involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.477" offset="9222642">Where this Court recognized that in the question of disclosure of campaign contributions, that public disclosure of contributions to candidates in political parties will deter some individuals who otherwise might contribute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2619.382" offset="10626253">The point is that when we have a decision like Moose Lodge from the Court, we have, I believe, a statement from the Court that in order for any of the 14th, 15th Amendment grants to be applicable you must have a finding that the particular activity involved constitutes public action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.840" offset="10720085">And I think that it's very clear by the decisions of this Court and especially footnote 16 in Buckley v. Valeo, that at this point in our history it is beyond doubt that primary contests, party primary contests are elections and that they can be heavily regulated because there is a public action that is taking place and that there would be a certain amount of retreat from that if we could say that this reform measure at the turn of the century from Wisconsin which outlawed the very thing that the National Party wanted to superimpose in Wisconsin... the very thing that was done in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.012" offset="10888732">In Michigan, the Attorney General declared that their open primary statute was unconstitutional and the whole process was displaced with a party caucus where there were fees to be paid and as a result, only 15,000 people determined the delegates from the state of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.832" offset="10968039">It seems to me that that is not the way this country has gone and that is not the direction that it should go; that it's a step back and that a reform measure to increase voter participation in election process has been viewed as, in Buckley, with great favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.806" offset="11043899">And in this context, we're not talking about the seating of delegates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.165" offset="11065319">We... the Wisconsin statute couldn't care less who are the delegates.</text>

            <text syncTime="2788.063" offset="11300944">And in light of Cousins, and the kind of meshing of kinds of public action by a National Party and private action, it should be done in the least offensive manner to make the law effective.</text>
