            <text syncTime="15.193" offset="246517">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="19.545" offset="263966">These consolidated cases are direct appeals by the Government from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois which declared unconstitutional four Acts of Congress that were passed in consecutive years between 1976 and 1979 to hold down or eliminate annual cost-of-living salary increases for all high-ranking federal officials, including the Vice President, Members of Congress, Cabinet and sub-Cabinet officials in the Executive Branch, and federal judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.718" offset="400639">The District Judge held that to the extent these pay freeze statutes applied to judges, they violated the compensation clause of Article III of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.173" offset="442435">The District Court also held that as a matter of statutory construction the statutes were not intended by Congress to be substantive legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.798" offset="480992">That is, they were not intended to wipe out the federal officials' entitlement to a cost-of-living increase but were instead only appropriations measures that refused to provide the money for salary increases required by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.641" offset="540342">The Government in these appeals has challenged each of these holdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.926" offset="557478">Before setting forth the facts that led to these lawsuits I think it would be helpful to begin by briefly explaining the somewhat complicated mechanism by which the pay of federal judges is determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.435" offset="611499">For the first 180 years of our Nation's history, judicial salaries were fixed by Congress essentially on an ad hoc basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.606" offset="644205">During this period Congress raised the salaries of Supreme Court Justices on 12 occasions and raised the salaries of lower court judges on nine occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.231" offset="682657">Congress finally changed this system in 1967 by passing the Federal Salary Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.218" offset="710660">Under this Act the salaries of federal judges as well as the Vice President, Members of Congress, Cabinet officers, and selected other high level officials are reviewed by a blue ribbon commission every four years to determine appropriate pay levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.846" offset="781191">This commission reports its findings to the President who must submit to Congress in his next budget message recommendations for the exact rate of pay for these officials, and then within 60 days both Houses of Congress must vote on the President's recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.308" offset="847019">The first federal salary act review took place in fiscal year 1969 and the review process has occurred every four years since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.830" offset="885054">In fact, just last week the membership of the fiscal 1981 review commission was announced and that commission is scheduled to make its report to the President on increases in judicial and other salaries by the end of this calendar year.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.423" offset="943464">Now, the Federal Salary Act contains no mechanism for annual adjustments of salaries of the officials covered by that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.279" offset="978886">Rather, the only means specified in the Salary Act for modifying such salaries is the quadrennial review process.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.033" offset="1009919">In an attempt to remedy this problem Congress in 1975 passed the Executive Salary Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.539" offset="1043878">This Act applies, by and large, to the officials covered by the Federal Salary Act, including federal judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.478" offset="1071672">Now, under the Adjustment Act judicial salaries are subject to an annual increase equal to the annual percentage cost-of-living increase given to civil service employees in that year, pursuant to yet another statute, the Federal Pay Comparability Act of 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.606" offset="1148159">Under The Comparability Act the President each year must designate a pay agent to compare civil service salaries with the rates of pay for the same levels of work in private industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.014" offset="1197792">Following the study the pay agent submits his report to the President along with a recommendation of appropriate adjustments in civil service rates of pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.238" offset="1242722">After considering this report the President has two options.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.958" offset="1261635">First, he can inform Congress that he agrees with and adopts the agent's recommendation, in which event the recommended cost-of-living increase automatically goes into effect as of the first pay period after October 1st of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.949" offset="1317537">On the other hand, if because of a national emergency or economic conditions affecting the general welfare the President believes that the pay agent's recommendations are too high, the President may reject the pay agent's recommendation and submit an alternative pay raise plan to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.697" offset="1392561">If neither House of Congress disapproves the President's alternative plan, it goes into effect on the first pay period after October 1st.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.468" offset="1435610">However, if the House or the Senate disapproves the President's alternative plan within 30 days, then the original recommendation of the pay agent goes into effect for civil service employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="325.895" offset="1489318">The President's recommendation could conceivably be downwards, and generally it is downwards rather than upward.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.234" offset="1522650">Now, as I mentioned earlier, the Adjustment Act ties the cost-of-living increases of high-ranking federal officials including federal judges to the average cost-of-living increase given to civil servants under the Comparability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.593" offset="1584090">In addition the Adjustment Act specifies the effective date of any such adjustment for judges as of October 1st of each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.016" offset="1617841">So, to summarize, judicial pay is determined by reference to three separate statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.753" offset="1640724">There is the Federal Salary Act which sets a base pay for judges with a review of that base every four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.174" offset="1670504">And then there's the Adjustment Act which provides that judges may get an annual cost-of-living increase measured by the cost-of-living increase given to civil service employees under the Comparability Act, and the Adjustment Act increase goes into effect... if there is one... on October 1st of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.987" offset="1745736">Now, the first year the Adjustment Act was in effect was 1975, and in October, 1975, civil service salaries were increased by an average of five percent pursuant to the Comparability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.747" offset="1808744">And as a result, federal judges and other officials covered by the Adjustment Act received a like increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.584" offset="1836120">The events that led to these lawsuits began in the fall of 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.555" offset="1859944">In October, 1976, the salaries of civil service employees were increased by an average of 4.8 percent under the Comparability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.612" offset="1900172">On September 22, 1976, however, the House and Senate passed a bill which was signed by the President on October 1st providing that none of the funds appropriated in any statute could be used to pay the salary of any official covered by the Adjustment Act at a rate that exceeded the salary in effect for that official on September 30th, 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.411" offset="1999437">In other words, this statute which we've referred to in this litigation as the 1976 Pay Act prevented the 1976 Adjustment Act increases from taking effect for federal judges and a number of other high level officials.</text>

            <text syncTime="510.081" offset="2226076">Now, in each of the next three years after 1976 Congress passed a separate pay act to limit or eliminate the anticipated Adjustment Act increase for that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.039" offset="2273932">In July 1977 Congress passed the 1977 Pay Act which provided that the cost-of-living increases that would have become effective in October, 1977, "shall not take effect".</text>
            <text syncTime="537.417" offset="2335372">The reason Congress did this was because in March of 1977 the officials covered by the Adjustment Act had received their quadrennial salary increase pursuant to the Salary Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.059" offset="2385945">Federal judges, for example, had gotten a pay raise of almost 30 percent under the Salary Act in March, 1977, and there was substantial sentiment in Congress that high-ranking federal officials should not get two pay increases in the course of a single year.</text>

            <text syncTime="1268.009" offset="5257743">Therefore, we believe it's clear that the members of this Court and the District Judge technically have a disqualifying interest within the meaning of the judicial recusal statute, 28 U.S.C. 455.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.150" offset="5306330">Nonetheless, all the parties and amici agree that this is an appropriate instance for invoking the so-called rule of necessity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1553.724" offset="6400652">It seems to us that if every judge is disqualified there's no reason to leave that judgment outstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.259" offset="6418833">However, there's another possibility here which I should mention, and that is, the Members of this Court may feel that they are disqualified because they are parties to this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.182" offset="6454464">Now, not every federal judge now on the bench is a party to this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.185" offset="6470451">A judge who was appointed after October 12, 1979, would not be a member of any of the certified classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.156" offset="6498350">Now, 28 U.S.C. 2109 allows this Court in a case in which there is no quorum, because more than four Justices are disqualified, to remit the case to the appropriate circuit to be heard by a panel of that circuit, and finally determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.884" offset="6569299">So if this Court decides that the rule of necessity does apply but that the Justices of this Court have a special disqualification because they're members of a class, then I suppose the appropriate disposition would be to send the case back to the 7th Circuit to be heard by a three-judge panel composed of judges who were appointed after October 12, 1979.</text>

            <text syncTime="1633.790" offset="6720913">That's why we think this Court should decide the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.640" offset="6728332">But the Members of this Court have two disqualifications; there are members of the federal judiciary now who only have one disqualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.210" offset="6754559">If that is deemed relevant by this Court, then there is the option of sending it back to the 7th Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.698" offset="6772531">I'd like to turn, then, to the statutory basis for the District Court's holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.751" offset="6796773">The court's statutory determination is extremely important for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.321" offset="6815059">First, if this Court agrees with the District Court that the appellees had a statutory right to their cost-of-living increases over the past four years, then there will be no need to reach the constitutional issues raised by the Pay Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.396" offset="6867304">Second, the district judge's statutory holding affects a great many federal employees other than judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.383" offset="6891336">If the District Court is correct as a matter of statutory construction, then not only judges but about 2,000 other federal employees covered by the Adjustment Act would have gotten salary raises in each of the last four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.877" offset="6945253">And, in addition, some 20,000 civil servants whose pay is subject to a statutory ceiling pegged to the lowest executive schedule salary level would also be entitled to receive back pay, because the ceiling would have been raised in each of the last four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.886" offset="7009305">These combined pay increases would total several hundred million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.373" offset="7027277">In light of these two important considerations, the District Court's treatment of the statutory issue is somewhat remarkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.210" offset="7054549">The issue is discussed in a single paragraph at the very end of its opinion in Will I.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.014" offset="7077850">The court merely states that none of the Pay Acts contains any language indicating that it was intended to be anything more than an appropriation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.803" offset="7112959">But the 1977 Pay Act, at least, was not an appropriation statute at all, and while the other three Pay Acts were part of appropriations bills, this Court has made clear on several occasions that Congress if it wants to can suspend or repeal substantive legislation in an appropriations act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1787.540" offset="7335940">Anyway, as the Court said in Belknap, the whole question depends on the intention of Congress as to whether an appropriation statute was intended to amend or repeal substantive legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1848.678" offset="7580446">There's virtually no evidence in the legislative record to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.130" offset="7594239">In fact, because the whole purpose of the Pay Acts was to hold down the pay of high-ranking federal officials, largely as an anti-inflation measure, it would have defeated Congress's express objectives if the Pay Acts had simply been limitations on expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.658" offset="7660381">What this would have meant is that Congress in four consecutive years merely wanted to withhold funds necessary to meet the Government's acknowledged obligations under the Adjustment Act, but to leave those substantive obligations intact, knowing full well that those obligations could be enforced in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.537" offset="7735927">Neither the district judge nor appellees have offered any plausible explanation why Congress would repeatedly have engaged in such a senseless and futile exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.761" offset="7776783">Now, if this Court agrees that the Pay Acts were intended to be substantive legislation, then the question remains whether that legislation is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.116" offset="7818265">The Compensation Clause analysis essentially involves two separate inquiries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.204" offset="7842611">First, were judicial salaries diminished in the constitutional sense by the Pay Acts?</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.710" offset="7868629">And second, if a diminishment occurred, was it the sort of reduction prohibited by Article III?</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.214" offset="7898618">It's the Government's position that the 1976, 1977, and 1978 Pay Acts did not diminish appellees' compensation because at the time these statutes were enacted, the annual cost-of-living adjustments allowed by the Adjustment Act had not yet gone into effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="3180.283" offset="12906918">I guess this takes us to to where the statutes are, what the Constitution provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.254" offset="12930742">The Constitution provides, in very unequivocal terms, that a judge is to receive a compensation which shall not be diminished.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.258" offset="12954775">Mr. Geller opened his comments by saying that these were complex statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.744" offset="12976717">These are about as simple and unequivocal as statutes as appear on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.433" offset="13007437">Not a one of them exceeds more than a few lines that are relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.885" offset="13025305">Section 135 provides a salary for a district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.289" offset="13046935">The language of the other statutes for other judges are in the same language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.177" offset="13070445">One-thirty-five provides that a district judge shall receive a salary at a rate determined under the Salary Act, as has been discussed, as adjusted by the Adjustment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.602" offset="13124152">The Salary Act, of course, is the provision for the quadrennial raises on those few occasions that Congress permits them to go ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.125" offset="13166262">And I might add that the system has now been changed so that it requires an affirmative vote in both houses before a raise can go into effect under the Salary Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.248" offset="13198758">But the Adjustment Act, which is the principal act at issue here, provides in very unequivocal terms... and the relevant portions are again about two lines long... it provides that for each fiscal year judges' salaries shall be adjusted in an amount equal to the percentage adjustment granted general schedule employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.895" offset="13281305">Incidentally, none of the statutes that have been referred to that are intended to prevent that adjustment, including the one adopted in July, 1977, ever mention any intent to repeal or modify or amend the rights under the Adjustment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.558" offset="13359986">The Adjustment Act applies to all executive level employees except with respect to judges.</text>

            <text syncTime="3634.196" offset="14722533">The language of Hamilton that his circumstance should never be less, there just are reams of history on the point, and they all seem to be clearly talking about you can never cut a judge's pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="3663.299" offset="14838935">In fact they specifically considered those points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.417" offset="14851473">In Article I they provided that Congress can set its pay and the pay of other federal employees any way it wants, upward or downward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.238" offset="14878745">And Article II, it says with respect to the President, you cannot cut his pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="4699.933" offset="18985508">At first we quibbled about the formula problem in this case, in the lower court and in the opening briefs here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4706.254" offset="19010794">In other words, we thought that the Government's problem with the concept of a future promise was that, well, we don't know exactly what it is yet, because we don't know what the formula is going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4716.110" offset="19050187">In their reply brief they concede that it's got nothing to do with formulas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4720.530" offset="19067846">Their problem is that it's a promise for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="4725.149" offset="19086340">And so, for example, they said, if the Congress passed the law and the President signed the law providing that judges are to receive a $9,000 increase payable $3,000 March 1, 1981; $3,000 March 1, 1982; $3,000 March 1, 1984, that notes that is not an enforceable promise under the compensation clause until that March 1 date.</text>
            <text syncTime="4753.918" offset="19201384">Now this is directly applicable to what the President attempted to do back in 1975, I think, when President Nixon said he'd go along with the 25 percent recommendation of his commission but he was going to make it payable in three installments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4771.780" offset="19272855">A lot of judges resigned because Congress vetoed that recommendation.</text>

            <text syncTime="5303.852" offset="21401207">First, let me begin by correcting a misstatement which Mr. Forde just made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5310.456" offset="21427539">Three of the four Pay Acts expressly refer to the Adjustment Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="5319.127" offset="21462229">Second, although there was some equivocation in his answers, I think that the salient point of the appellees' argument was the answer that Mr. Forde gave to Justice Stevens' question, yes, if their argument is accepted, then Congress could not repeal the Adjustment Act at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5339.541" offset="21543940">Although, I might add, they do concede, as I think they have to, that Congress could repeal either on a one year basis or permanently the Comparability Act, which would leave judges in exactly the same position as these Pay Acts have left them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5351.699" offset="21592528">I think that shows the technical nature of the arguments that appellees are making here today.</text>

            <text syncTime="5509.014" offset="22221766">But there's no indication that in passing the statute Congress intended to surrender its ultimate authority granted by the framers of the Constitution to raise or to refuse to raise salaries of all federal officials including federal judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="5523.541" offset="22279966">Indeed, we think the fact that the Congress that passed the Adjustment Act was the very same Congress that less than a year later passed the 1976 Pay Act, so I don't think that they thought that by trying to search for a better mechanism to deal with judicial pay they were freezing into the Constitution this Adjustment Act procedure and binding all future Congresses never to be able to refuse to allow increases to go into effect.</text>
