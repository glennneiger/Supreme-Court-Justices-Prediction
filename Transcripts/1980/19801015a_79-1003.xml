            <text syncTime="8.570" offset="175306">Mr. Harmon, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. James H. Harmon</label>
            <text syncTime="62.906" offset="392644">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.723" offset="395884">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="67.758" offset="411975">The issue in this case is whether it is permissible, consistent with principles of res judicata and the Anti-Injunction Act, for the federal court to enjoin enforcement of a ground water exportation restriction in Mr. McDougal's use permit when the California Supreme Court earlier ruled the restriction enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.027" offset="533079">If I may, before going to the facts of the case, I would like to briefly address the geographical setting for this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.418" offset="574666">In this Court's recent opinion in Bryant v. Yellen, the Court described the Imperial Valley as an area located south of the Salton Sea in southeastern California.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.012" offset="637046">It lies below sea level and is an arid desert in its natural state.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.181" offset="665676">That case, the 160-acre limitation case, dealt with lands in Imperial County which are within the irrigation district boundaries and are irrigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.806" offset="708204">Mr. McDougal's parcel, however, lies on the West Mesa of Imperial County, an area totally dependent on ground water supplies.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.697" offset="751776">Going to the facts of the case, the California Supreme Court found Mr. McDougal estopped from challenging, and thereby bound by the export restriction in his use permit based on facts which showed that his predecessor, with counsel, agreed to the imposition of the export restriction, abided by it, and benefited from the limited permit as issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.704" offset="891792">Further, Mr. McDougal when he purchased the property was aware of the restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.274" offset="918124">When Mr. McDougal went to the County officials and demanded removal of the export restriction, he was informed that he should make application for a new conditional use permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.867" offset="980400">Instead of applying for a use permit, Mr. McDougal simply defied the County authorities, entered the subject brokerage contract with respondent Munoz and immediately as many as 44 tank trucks carrying 250,000 gallons a day began export of water to Mexicali, Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.416" offset="1078620">One of the major allegations of the respondent's complaint is that enforcement of the subject export restriction will cause economic hardship to them by requiring them to go eight miles farther north in the County, to the so-called Clifford well, to buy water for export.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.518" offset="1195022">It is alleged that the price of water is higher at the Clifford well, also in the County eight miles north.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="269.572" stopTime="272.524">
            <label>Justice Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="269.572" offset="1219263">How far away is Mexicali from this well?</text>

            <text syncTime="281.397" offset="1266597">--The well is on Highway 98, which kind of parallels the Border, and the Ocotillo well is eight miles north on Highway 98.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.823" offset="1320305">I believe that the res judicata issue is the major issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.114" offset="1365444">The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, of course, rejected the County's argument on res judicata by concluding that the McDougal decision is not a final judgment on the merits as to the respondents' cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.445" offset="1446737">That's fundamentally incorrect.</text>

            <text syncTime="2131.936" offset="8668759">I think that with respect to parties who were not party to the state litigation, we're talking about collateral estoppel and we're talking about issues that were actually decided, issues that we might use as a sword or a shield against those non-parties and for purposes of collateral estoppel it seems to me that the only items that might be asserted for that purpose are issues that were actually decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="2167.775" offset="8812119">At some point in time, I think it's fair to say that third parties who have never been in a court proceedings ought to have the right to have the question decided either for them or against them, unless we can say that those parties were so close to the proceedings in California that they ought to be bound, and that somehow McDougal stood in their shoes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3042.278" offset="12310124">It got to the Court of Appeals and this California Court of Appeals said, it's patently unconstitutional, it burdens interstate commerce, and they declared the entire conditional use permit void.</text>

            <text syncTime="3069.780" offset="12420151">And that makes, I think, a good deal of sense, because there are thousands of restrictions on conditional use permits in the State of California, very few of which probably rise to the dignity of a constitutional challenge, and I don't think California courts wanted to open their courts to those kinds of challenges.</text>

Bimco, will be to tell plaintiffs that 2283 may be used as a forum shopping tool by the respondent or defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.130" offset="12625474">All they need do is raise 2283 to a third party and that third party who has never been in a state court... he's told, gee, you should have started your lawsuit in a state court when we had a federal question with diversity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.739" offset="12683988">In conclusion, I would suggest that to apply 2283 to third party non-litigants would elevate the provisions of that section against the basic fundamental notion and concept that parties ought to be given their day in the court of their choice and with respect to federal questions they ought to be able to bring federal questions to a federal court to litigate it.</text>
