            <text syncTime="863.253" offset="3608903">Well, let me go ahead and address the standing issue at this time, and insofar as it is properly before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.574" offset="3634189">We believe that the standing issue is not before this Court and would urge the Court not to take the government's invitation to remand this case in order to determine if Petitioner has a standing under the more recent case of United States v. Salvucci.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.118" offset="3712348">And our reason for this is that Rakas v. Illinois was decided in December of 1978, which clearly delineated the notion that standing is a function of an expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.782" offset="3787058">Briefs in the Fifth Circuit in this case, by the Appellant and the government were not filed until 1979, so not only did the government have ample opportunity to ask the Fifth Circuit to remand or to... remand for standing or to decide the Petitioner didn't have standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.076" offset="3856230">But moreover, they could have raised it, of course, at the trial level.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.545" offset="3874098">Salvucci raised his standing argument from the very beginning, and of course Salvucci eventually overruled the automatic standing requirement of Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.920" offset="3915580">The government says that because we were all proceeding under Jones, that this Court should reevaluate the case in light of Salvucci, we say the government made a tactical decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.359" offset="3953301">In the Fifth Circuit, they had Rakas to stand on, and they could have asked that the case be remanded; they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.180" offset="3980573">We infer from the record that they didn't, because they knew that they had Cravero in their hip pocket.</text>

            <text syncTime="1425.033" offset="5856060">So we say that the government had to have a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.833" offset="5867241">Now the government also raises, again for the first time in this Court, the argument that because Cravero... United States v.

            <text syncTime="1458.421" offset="5989598">We say in response to that, first, there is substantial doubt from this record that the governments were in fact acting in good faith.</text>

            <text syncTime="1476.466" offset="6061696">And we point to these facts in the record: the confidential informant had said that there had been a drug deal in Florida recently consummated by Ricky Lyons and this individual named Jimmy, that Jimmy had attempted to sell cocaine, a matter of days or a week prior to the conversation that he had in early January with the Drug Enforcement agent--</text>

            <text syncTime="1506.068" offset="6180188">When the confidential informant first told the Drug Enforcement agent about the attempt by Jimmy to sell him cocaine, the agent's first response was not to find Ricky Lyons, was not to get that information, but was to try to prevail upon the confidential informant to set up a drug deal with Jimmy and have this one go through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.200" offset="6272661">Second, that same agent testified at the evidentiary hearing on the motion to suppress as to whether or not it was his impression from the confidential informant that the house where Ricky Lyons was, was a "stash house for narcotics".</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.810" offset="6339117">He answered, I asked him that, if he knew there was going to be any dope there, he says they always had dope around.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.629" offset="6366389">I said do you know if there's going to be any there, he said well I don't know, but they deal in it, they might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.600" offset="6390317">And that's in Volume II of the suppression hearing at page 47.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.171" offset="6404527">Moreover, Agent Goodowens testified... who was one of the Drug Enforcement Administration agents... testified that the confidential informant believed that there would be drugs there, but that he didn't have it on what the agent called hard information, in other words, the government agent did not have sufficiently hard information to get a search warrant for drugs, but they believed that drugs would be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.970" offset="6503793">Finally, a Gwinnett County police officer, which is the county in Georgia where this house was located, testified that one of the Drug Enforcement Administration agents had told him when the agent first called him to organize this raid, that he had information there might be a quantity of marijuana in this house and he testified that to the best of his recollection the agent told him 1500 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.370" offset="6613402">Finally, after the quick, first search of this house, when the agent came back outside to report what he had found to the other agents, he did not say, as they were looking for this armed and dangerous Ricky Lyons, no luck, Ricky Lyons isn't here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.017" offset="6687904">He said, I think I found some cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.433" offset="6697621">We believe Your Honors, that there is substantial doubt in the record that they were acting in good faith; indeed, we believe there is a great likelihood that the agents in this case did exactly what Cravero gives them an incentive to do, and that is, they used an arrest warrant to circumvent the search warrant requirements of the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1683.200" offset="6888733">Secondly, on the good faith argument, in order to apply a good faith exception here in this case the Court would have to avoid reaching the actual issue it has taken certiorari on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.975" offset="6955815">Article III, of course, would prevent this Court from finding that a search warrant is necessary in these circumstances, but it's not... and will be necessary from now on, but it's not necessary to apply the exclusionary rule in this case because the government was acting in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.039" offset="7040034">That would stand as mere dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.408" offset="7049543">Therefore, an order to avoid applying the exclusionary rule to Petitioner's case by adopting some sort of a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule, the Court would have to avoid the central issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.100" offset="7108266">We urge the Court not to do that, the question has evaded review for quite some time; it was characterized as a grave constitutional issue as long ago as 1958 in Jones v. United States, and the Cravero rule or its equivalent, is used by a number of the Circuits... it is not used by others, the states are split on the use of it, as are the commentators.</text>

            <text syncTime="1813.585" offset="7410242">The Cravero says that reasonable belief embodies the same standard of reasonableness as probable cause, but simply gives the police... or permits the police to avoid a second trip to the magistrate, in other words, having been there once to get the arrest warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1833.628" offset="7490385">That to me, implies that they had to have what would have been necessary to convince the magistrate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1839.280" offset="7512955">Which would have been probable cause; it wouldn't do any good to go to the magistrate with something less than probable cause, because you wouldn't get the search warrant.</text>

            <label>Mr. John Richard Young</label>
            <text syncTime="1845.520" offset="7537928">Well, but Your Honor, we say that probable cause is... goes hand in hand with one of two things: a magistrate, or exigent circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.625" offset="7578366">And in this case, or in Cravero, since the Court permits a finding of probable cause without exigent circumstances and without a magistrate, that is why they have called it something of a lesser standard, namely reasonable belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.401" offset="7641477">It is also the authority upon which Cravero relies, is really a strain of authority from the previously discredited Rabinowitz decision that also dealt in terms of a reasonable belief standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="1898.987" offset="7751819">On the basic argument, the government says that the common law is against you, and I don't think you respond to that; do you concede they correctly interpret the common law?</text>

            <text syncTime="1908.993" offset="7791838">In fact, having read several of the cases upon which the government relies, we say that there are two significant errors in the government's analysis of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.484" offset="7841784">And the first is, that for example in... I think it's Semayne's Case, Lord Coke is addressing a situation where the house which is entered is the defendant's house himself, not a third party's house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.160" offset="7896537">Moreover, in the Semayne's Case, Lord Coke is somewhat elaborating upon the rationale for his decision in that case, which was a civil case incidentally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.837" offset="7951185">And he gives an example in which the type of arrest that occurred in this case would be permitted, and it was a hot pursuit example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.657" offset="7982532">It's a straight Warden v. Hayden, decided in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.828" offset="7999146">Finally of course, because of the reverence of common law for the sanctity of the privacy of an individual's home as opposed to the right of privacy in other situations, we believe that the common law did not permit this type of search and if... but in any event, or at the very least, it is unclear whether the common law did or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.676" offset="8098620">Additionally, the arrest rules of common law arose in the context of usually civil damage suits or either false arrest or trespassing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.536" offset="8158075">And consequently, they are not... even if they are as the government says they are... they are not directly applicable to the situation we are dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.876" offset="8195378">And the officer's authority to enter was generally established in cases where he was being sued and that was his defense, that he had the authority to enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.331" offset="8229233">And finally, of course, as this Court noted just last term, in Payton v. New York, this Court does not simply freeze into constitutional law, law enforcement practices that existed at the time the Fourth Amendment was enacted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2045.546" offset="8338111">This case presents three distinct issues to the Court: the first is whether Petitioner's legitimate expectations of privacy were implicated by the entry into the cabin so that he is entitled to raise the substantive Fourth Amendment issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.623" offset="8394326">The second is whether the Court should decline to consider the substantive Fourth Amendment issue in this case as a matter of exclusionary rule, and retroactivity policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.729" offset="8434764">And the third, if the Court reaches the issue, is whether an arrest warrant plus reason to believe or probable cause to believe the subject of the warrant is on the premises suffices to justify an entry into third party premises to execute the arrest warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.373" offset="8501324">With the Court's permission, I will treat these issues in the order I have listed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.742" offset="8522849">First, with respect to what I hope Justice Rehnquist will give me the liberty of calling the standing issue, this is essentially offered to this Court as an alternative ground for affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.068" offset="8576139">We do not in fact suggest affirmance on this ground, although we think the record would permit it, but, in light of what the Court did in Combs and what the Court did last term in Salvucci, and the fact that there was no focus on the issue of Petitioner's expectation of privacy in the cabin, we think fairness would justify giving him an opportunity to demonstrate that on a remand.</text>

            <text syncTime="3153.990" offset="12771822">Now laying this point aside and considering the matter from the standpoint of logic and policy, the argument is not all one-sided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.661" offset="12806513">Now, we grant that there will be some cases in which a search warrant requirement would be useful in interposing a magistrate and preventing overzealous police officers from unreasonably invading third party premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.403" offset="12857504">But the issue must be placed in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.855" offset="12867326">Because we are talking about third party premises and not the residence of the individual named in the warrant, we are dealing with a class of cases in which, by definition, the connection of the suspect to the premises is likely to be brief or transitory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.782" offset="12926989">Accordingly, a much higher proportion of this class of cases will involve exigent circumstances or at least circumstances in which recourse to the warrant procedure with the delays it often entails, will render the information regarding the presence of the subject on the premises stale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.910" offset="12999505">What I'm saying is that the benefits that we may reasonably expect to reap from the imposition of a search warrant requirement, are considerably diminished as against those which could have been anticipated from the decision in Payton.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.484" offset="13053840">With the weight on one side of the scale thus diminished, it seems to us questionable conclusion that an arrest entry by officers armed with an arrest warrant and possessing sufficient reason to believe the subject of the warrant is on the premises, is unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment unless they also possess a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.965" offset="13131789">Now let me summarize the factors that favor continued adherence to the common law rule that an arrest warrant suffices to enter any premises in which the suspect is reasonably believed to be located.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.522" offset="13177974">First, the arrest warrant means that the magistrate has determined one of the elements required to be determined by the warrant clause; that is, he has determined that there is probable cause to seize the person named in the arrest warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.913" offset="13235548">We concede of course that he has not determined that the person named in the arrest warrant is on the premises to which entry is to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.137" offset="13272433">And I think that the case is weaker than Payton, that is, Payton's conclusion that an arrest warrant sufficed to enter into the premises of the individual named in the arrest warrant, rests on stronger grounds because of the greater likelihood that the individual will in fact be on his premises, and because of the fact that there are no general warrant problems associated with treating the arrest warrant as a power to enter into premises--</text>
