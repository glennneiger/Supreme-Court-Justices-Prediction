            <text syncTime="2522.519" offset="10236339">On the merits of the case, on the constitutionality of the statute in question, the Court must first address itself to a threshold question, and that is whether under any situation, under any circumstances, can a state's treatment of foreign commerce ever be discriminatory towards interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.819" offset="10349502">Obviously the Congress has the authority to regulate interstate commerce, and a state statute which places a discriminatory burden on interstate commerce is violative of the Commerce Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2601.798" offset="10553466">On top of that a two-pronged foreign commerce test was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.296" offset="10575409">In that situation the four-pronged complete auto test still had to be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.872" offset="10597769">One of the aspects there is whether the statute is discriminatory or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.621" offset="10616682">Does the statute regulate evenhandedly?</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.682" offset="10628907">If it does it probably will be upheld unless there is an excessive burden placed on commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.633" offset="10656806">In this case, we have a statute which does not regulate even-handedly on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.097" offset="10682615">Therefore, the Court of Appeal properly looked at the statute itself as opposed to the interest to be justified by the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="2667.304" offset="10815422">However, the statute differentiated on its face between commerce interstate and domestic.</text>

            <text syncTime="2705.757" offset="10969231">Similar, our statute operates the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.318" offset="10987516">We have a legitimate means, legitimate interests in California in protecting its port and warehousing trade as a pure economic interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.266" offset="11031298">It's not health and safety; pure economics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.546" offset="11040388">It cannot justify a discriminatory statute, especially when there are at least two alternatives available to it to achieve this same purpose with no discriminatory impact on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.462" offset="11108098">California could have exempted all business inventory to be shipped out of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.975" offset="11134115">That would have had the same effect in fostering and encouraging the local economic interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.301" offset="11159402">Or it could have exempted all business inventory within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.409" offset="11175911">That too is an available non-discriminatory alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.280" offset="11195346">California finally chose the latter course of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.920" offset="11205900">It amended Section 219, which had the effect of repealing Section 225, the statute in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.589" offset="11240591">Hence, California has recognized the invalidity of the statute and now has moved to cure it in a manner in accord with other states in the nation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2822.570" offset="11436509">It can be derived simply by looking at the benefit to be obtained by foreign commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="3580.162" offset="14466922">Yes, Mr. Justice, I agree that in virtually every case decided by this Court in the last five years, more, there have been protectionist overtones, a State attempt to isolate itself in some economic manner to benefit its citizens, its industry vis-a-vis out-of-state industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.043" offset="14578413">We do not have protectionist measures here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.228" offset="14591160">There is no attempt by California to isolate itself or its businesses.</text>
