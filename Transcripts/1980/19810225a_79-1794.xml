            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="178161">We will hear arguments next in Michigan v. Summers.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.372" offset="215568">Mr. Baughman, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Timothy A. Baughman</label>
            <text syncTime="61.655" offset="424757">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="65.542" offset="440326">I would like to take just a few moments to review the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.910" offset="453701">But before I do I would like to first state concisely the framework in which the State of Michigan views this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.298" offset="483271">We view this as a warrants case involving an issue as to the scope of the search allowed under a warrant which is directed at premises involving an issue as to the authority given to the executing officers by the warrant itself to detain persons on or departing from the premises for a period of time reasonable and necessary to insure the full and faithful execution of that warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.799" offset="585253">Now, the facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.650" offset="592672">One October tenth at approximately 10:10 p.m. a team of Detroit police officers arrived at a residence in the City of Detroit to execute a search warrant for narcotics and narcotics paraphernalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.058" offset="642305">The affidavit in support of that warrant indicated that a purchase of heroin had been made inside that residence the day previous from a black male known as George.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.014" offset="682115">As the officers arrived to execute the warrant they observed respondent, George Summers, come out of the house and proceed down the front steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.770" offset="717224">They stopped him and asked him if he lived in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.989" offset="730076">He answered affirmatively and was shown a copy of the search warrant and asked if he could get the officers inside the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.144" offset="758706">He responded that he had left his keys inside but could ring someone over the intercom.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.962" offset="777932">He did so and a person later known to be Dwight Calhoun answered the door by opening the inner door.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.300" offset="803323">He realized the officers' authority and purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.435" offset="815862">He slammed that door shut and the door was then broken down by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.320" offset="835402">Mr. Summers was then brought inside the dwelling and taken into the living room.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.058" offset="858390">Once the premises were secured, and by that I mean, once Mr. Summers and the other seven persons who were present in the house at the time were gathered in the living room, one officer as part of his duties in executing the warrant went to the basement to search, and there he found heroin, in the basement.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.418" offset="919830">Mr. Summers was then arrested for the possession of this heroin, the heroin found in the basement, and a search of his person incident to that arrest revealed heroin also in his jacket pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.091" offset="958491">It was the heroin in his jacket pocket which ultimately formed the basis of the charge against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.409" offset="979702">He was bound over for trial on that charge but the charge was dismissed by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.547" offset="1000287">The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed that dismissal, holding that the arrest for possession of the heroin in the basement was without probable cause because the officers did not possess sufficient facts to sustain conviction on that charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.140" offset="1058697">The Michigan Court of Appeals also rejected the argument that Mr. Summers could be searched under the authority of the warrant itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.311" offset="1087327">The Michigan Supreme Court granted leave on those issues but decided the case on a different issue after this Court's decision in Dunaway v. New York, holding that the initial detention of Mr. Summers when he was brought from the porch inside the house was without probable cause and that being without probable cause it was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.522" offset="1156185">And this Court then granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.909" offset="1177710">It is our position, first, that the search of Mr. Summers was justifiable under the search warrant itself, that a search warrant for private premises allows a search of reasonable scope and intensity of persons present on the premises where the items particularized in the warrant might be found on the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.488" offset="1252107">Now, it is true that the officers in this case--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="270.505" offset="1260153">This would go to anybody who was on the premises?</text>

          <turn speaker="timothy_a_baughman" startTime="272.174" stopTime="274.107">
            <label>Mr. Timothy A. Baughman</label>
            <text syncTime="272.174" offset="1266840">--That's correct, anyone.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="274.107" offset="1274572">Under your theory, if there were, let us say, six or eight men in the house and, as the officers entered, all of them rushed toward the door and wanted to get out, they could be stopped long enough, on your theory, to fulfill the purposes of the warrant?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="timothy_a_baughman" startTime="294.688" stopTime="345.371">
            <label>Mr. Timothy A. Baughman</label>
            <text syncTime="294.688" offset="1356910">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.040" offset="1362239">It would be... in this case there in fact were eight persons on the premises, and under our first argument the search, that the people could be searched under the warrant itself, all those persons pockets, their outer clothing, could be searched for the items named in the warrant, assuming, as in this case, that the items are of the type which could be concealed or found on the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.251" offset="1431098">If there was typewriters or something like that, then they could not be searched, because it would not be reasonable to expect to find the items on the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.255" offset="1463177">The officers did not, of course, in this case search Mr. Summers on the basis of the warrant, but this Court has held that it is not necessary that the officers have the subjective legal justification which supports their action so long as we objectively, the law does support the action which was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.133" offset="1534648">And we submit that that is what happened in this case, that the search warrant does support the search of Mr. Summers.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="345.371" stopTime="360.796">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="345.371" offset="1559621">You don't think it supports... you don't think you could hold a person just because, if you find something in the house, you could arrest the owner of the house?</text>

            <text syncTime="360.796" offset="1621270">It's first our position that without regard to whether they had found the heroin in the house they could--</text>

          <turn speaker="timothy_a_baughman" startTime="366.750" stopTime="373.288">
            <label>Mr. Timothy A. Baughman</label>
            <text syncTime="366.750" offset="1645093">--Yes, that they could have searched Mr. Summers simply as they could have searched a nightstand or a desk drawer because the heroin could be inside.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="373.288" stopTime="400.957">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="373.288" offset="1671216">Right; right.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.390" offset="1675709">Going back to the hypothetical I gave you, which by coincidence happens to be the same number, is it your theory that if the eight people immediately wanted to dash out of the house, the officers would have no way of knowing which was the owner or who were the owners, and therefore they could detain all of them long enough to consummate the execution of the warrant?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="timothy_a_baughman" startTime="400.957" stopTime="423.804">
            <label>Mr. Timothy A. Baughman</label>
            <text syncTime="400.957" offset="1781975">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.007" offset="1786154">And in fact, it would be our theory, as I will explain more fully in a moment, that even if a person were to say, I am not the owner, I am a visitor or I am a neighbor, that the officers would not have to rely on that declaration, but that they would nonetheless be allowed under the authority of the warrant to search all the persons present on the premises for the items named, in this case for heroin, if the items might be found on the person.</text>

            <text syncTime="423.804" offset="1873299">Mr. Baughman, is there a presumption in Michigan that the owner of the house is responsible for what's in it?</text>

            <text syncTime="435.611" offset="1920528">In fact, the Michigan Court of Appeals based its decision in part on the fact that under a peculiar Michigan law it's circumstantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.367" offset="1951562">Michigan holds... however, there's some dispute as to this... that you need to negative all theories consistent with innocence to support a conviction on circumstantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.156" offset="1990745">And therefore, ordinarily, when there is more than one occupant of the home, you can't convict anybody for possession of an item found in a common area.</text>

            <text syncTime="530.842" offset="2301498">In that case, of course, this Court held that a search warrant for Ybarra did not permit a search of the patrons in the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.579" offset="2332427">We believe first, that this is distinguishable in that Mr. Summers had a relationship to the premises in this case, the premises to be searched, and that he was an occupant owner of the premises; whereas the patrons in the Aurora Tap-Tavern in Ybarra had no nexus to the premises at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.006" offset="2394181">Under a traditional scope and intensity analysis, a search warrant allows the search of places within the premises where it's reasonable to believe that the items might be found.</text>

            <text syncTime="794.825" offset="3357368">The difficulty with the relationship of to the person to the premises or the nexus test is that in most cases the police will not have any idea of the relationship of the people to the premises, and in fact people may lie about their relationship to the premises if questions are asked.</text>

            <text syncTime="857.666" offset="3608770">Particularly when those requirements are considered, the authority to search persons on the premises makes sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1376.733" offset="5685087">Our position is, on this detention issue, that the Fourth Amendment contains two separate and independent clauses, a reasonableness clause and a warrant clause, and that the warrant clause is textually linked to the probable cause concept, but that arrests, seizures of the person, do not generally fall within the warrant clause and that even when they do, as in Payton v. New York, the concern of the Court is not with the warrantless seizure of the person but with the warrantless entering into the dwelling to effectuate that arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.550" offset="5792293">So we believe that seizures of the person should be reviewed for reasonableness and that detention of the persons on or departing from private premises when a search warrant is about to be executed is a class of reasonable detentions under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.141" offset="5842657">We go through a number of cases from this Court in our brief, and this Court always expresses the test as striking a balance between the public interest and the individual's right to personal security free from the arbitrary interference by law enforcement officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.884" offset="5901694">And we believe that the teaching of those cases is that detentions are constitutional, if reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.637" offset="5924682">And that reasonableness is a balancing between governmental interest and the individual's interest in personal liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.443" offset="5951849">The more severe the intrusion, the more information and the higher the governmental interest that's required to justify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.031" offset="5978285">Arrest to hold someone to answer for a crime requires what we would call probable cause in the traditional sense, because as stated by Chief Justice Warren in the Terry case, an arrest is the initial stage in a criminal prosecution and it is inevitably accompanied by future interference with the individual's freedom of movement, whether or not trial and conviction ultimately follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.761" offset="6057175">Detentions for custodial interrogations, as this Court held in Dunaway, require traditional probable cause because they are in many respects indistinguishable from an arrest to hold someone to answer for a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.466" offset="6100016">Other classes of detentions, this Court has held, do not require probable cause in the traditional sense, Terry stops, certain sorts of border stops.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.922" offset="6137841">And we submit that a search warrant itself should be viewed as authorizing a class of reasonable detentions, as I've said, those detentions which are reasonable and necessary for the full and safe execution of the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.516" offset="6192176">That authority should be implied from the fact of the warrant itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.636" offset="6212656">The governmental interest in allowing this class of detentions, we believe, is a weighty one, insuring the full execution of the warrant, avoidance in many cases of frustration of the warrant... since, as I've said, the police have to knock and announce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.360" offset="6259572">And even in this case, although Mr. Summers was coming out of the premises as the officers approached and we don't know what he had seen or hadn't seen, it is certainly not inconceivable that he saw the eight officers arriving, and put the item in his pocket and attempted to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.118" offset="6310563">And it's certainly not inconceivable that were he allowed to go about his business outside, that he might, as the Michigan Supreme Court dissenters noted, summon aid to interfere with the execution of the warrant or interfere with it himself from the outside.</text>

            <label>Mr. Elliott Schulder</label>
            <text syncTime="1729.521" offset="7096221">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.973" offset="7110014">In the brief time available to me I would like to address the aspect of this case that is of primary concern to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.329" offset="7143451">We view this case and the decision of the Michigan Supreme Court as sweeping well beyond the context of the execution of a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.268" offset="7179186">The question here is whether the Michigan Supreme Court properly read this Court's decision in Dunaway v. New York, to hold that any detention of a suspect beyond a momentary stop for brief questioning is not permissible under the Fourth Amendment, regardless of its reasonableness unless the officer has probable cause to arrest the suspect on criminal charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.281" offset="7263196">We believe that this decision is inconsistent with this Court's basic approach in this area of Fourth Amendment law, and that it unjustifiably precludes law enforcement officers from engaging in appropriate and legitimate law enforcement investigative activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.124" offset="7322651">In Dunaway the Court held that the detention of a suspect for custodial interrogation required probable cause for his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.480" offset="7360058">We believe that that was undoubtedly a correct result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.348" offset="7375523">The detention process itself is an unstructured and potentially open ended one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.085" offset="7394435">Moreover, as Justice Stevens noted in his concurring opinion in Dunaway, the possibility of obtaining a confession may increase in direct proportion to the length of the detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.477" offset="7439993">Most importantly, we submit, the police could prolong investigative stops in every case on the basis of reasonable suspicion, if they could simply justify the detention on the need for continued interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.053" offset="7502373">Thus, as the Court held in Dunaway, to have allowed prolonged detention in that case simply on the justification of custodial interrogation, would have permitted the police to go well beyond the narrow confines of the reasonable suspicion stop standard that the Court developed in Terry and its progeny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.685" offset="7600803">However, as Mr. Justice White emphasized in his concurring opinion in Dunaway, there is room within the Fourth Amendment, and the Fourth Amendment's reasonableness standard, to accommodate certain exceptions to the normal rule of probable cause where flexibility is essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.766" offset="7677185">Terry provides a case in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.118" offset="7686589">The detention in Terry was momentary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.919" offset="7705815">It occurred as the officer observed Terry and his companions parading around in front of a store and looking as if they were about to commit daylight armed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.143" offset="7750641">The officer in that case approached, asked a question of the suspects, and when the suspects muttered a response he seized Terry, turned him around, patted the outside pockets of his coat, discovered a weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.135" offset="7802677">That detention, although it took only several seconds, the Court held was a seizure of the person under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.009" offset="7842174">However, since the seizure was so different from the type of intrusion that accompanies an arrest, the Court found that there was a narrow exception to the probable cause requirement, and that reasonable suspicion alone was sufficient to justify the stop and the frisk of Terry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.737" offset="7921064">Now, in subsequent cases, the Court has applied the Terry reasonable suspicion standard to stops of automobiles and in Brignoni-Ponce the Court noted that the stop in that case involved simply the asking of several questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.032" offset="7998282">The Government had stated that the stops had taken usually no more than one minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.570" offset="8028375">In Martinez-Fuerte, however, involving fixed checkpoint stops, the Government in its brief pointed out that the average length of detention at the San Clemente checkpoint was from three to five minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.628" offset="8080620">That was at the secondary area where the officers in their discretion were able to direct drivers over for further investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.568" offset="8116355">And that detention occurred without any requirement of reasonable suspicion at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.672" offset="8140806">The Michigan Supreme Court in this case held that any detention for more than a brief or momentary period is per se unreasonable in the absence of probable cause without regard to the particular circumstances that may justify the detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.766" offset="8209142">We believe that this approach is not only contrary to the Fourth Amendment's central notion of reasonableness, it's also unduly restrictive of legitimate law enforcement activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.557" offset="8252297">There are numerous occasions when a suspect's responses to an officer's questions may intensify the officer's suspicions and yet not necessarily provide probable cause to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.347" offset="8295451">In these situations the police may attempt to maintain the status quo for a limited period in order to determine whether to arrest or release the suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.369" offset="8331604">As we pointed out in our brief, we have given several examples, such as the situation where the police responding to a report of a burglary or robbery see a suspect near the scene of a crime, pick him up, and return him to the scene for possible identification at a show up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.314" offset="8399314">Similarly there is a situation involving a computer check where the police stop an automobile which they suspect reasonably, but have no probable cause to believe, is stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.455" offset="8443931">They then radio in to headquarters for a check to see whether in fact the automobile has been reported as stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.726" offset="8472979">Under the Michigan Supreme Court's decision in this case these reasonable examples of good police work would not survive constitutional scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.266" offset="8519163">We wish to stress that our position here will not leave the police in an unstructured situation where they may arbitrarily detain suspects for extended periods on no more than a whim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.426" offset="8571826">In the first place, the officer must have reasonable articulable suspicion that the individual is involved in criminal activity before he may stop the individual for brief inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.299" offset="8611323">In order to detain the individual further after the individual has responded to the officer's questions the officer must have in mind a specific, independent avenue of investigation that requires the continued presence of the suspect, and that is reasonably likely to resolve the matter one way or the other, that is, whether to release or arrest the suspect within a relatively short time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.497" offset="8708081">The police may not detain a suspect on the basis of a vague hope that somehow evidence of his criminal conduct will materialize.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.186" offset="8738905">This case provides a good illustration of a situation--</text>

            <text syncTime="4362.939" offset="17629838">The case hinges on a Michigan case called People v.

            <text syncTime="4783.195" offset="19310870">It may be that the Michigan Supreme Court decided simply to discuss these questions in chronological order, and the first issue that comes up is the legality of the detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4792.551" offset="19348277">It may be that was the sole basis of why they addressed the detention issue rather than the subsequent state law issues that were found dispositive in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4801.489" offset="19384117">I think in those circumstances a remand would be appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="4805.024" offset="19398223">You said you did not want to get into the facts, but let me put this hypothetical to you that I put to your colleague.</text>
            <text syncTime="4811.714" offset="19424972">Suppose a warrant were to search for machine guns and hand grenades that were about to be sent to the IRA in Ireland, and they send a team of seven or eight officers out, adequately prepared for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.109" offset="19502504">Then do you think they may not detain the man at the door?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bruce_j_ennis_jr" startTime="4837.196" stopTime="4904.923">
            <label>Mr. Bruce J. Ennis, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="4837.196" offset="19526850">Well, Your Honor, I believe that the answer to that question can probably be resolved under existing law, under Terry v. Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.935" offset="19557883">Obviously, as you are aware, Your Honor, Terry does permit a pat down for weapons in circumstances where the police have reasonable suspicion to believe that a person might be armed and dangerous, even if they do not have probable cause to detain for a lengthy period of time or to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4861.578" offset="19624443">The interesting point here is that the Michigan Supreme Court did not even consider whether Terry, existing law, would have authorized that kind of a search involved in this case, because it went off on the quite different ground, under Dunaway, that there could be no detention whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="4881.124" offset="19702602">That, I think, is an additional reason why cert should be dismissed as improvidently granted, if the Court decides to reach that question, since that particular question, the scope of Terry in the circumstances of this case, has never been considered by the Michigan Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.320" offset="19767385">Again, I do appreciate the permission to argue as amicus.</text>
            <text syncTime="4900.955" offset="19781910">Thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="4996.545" offset="20164238">We believe that it is an error to view the permissible scope of Fourth Amendment detentions as only existing in a criminal context somewhere between reasonable suspicion and probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5008.101" offset="20210527">Reasonable detentions may occur without any particularized suspicion as to any individual, as this Court has held in border cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="5015.940" offset="20241874">People can be held against their wills to be witnesses in cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5019.158" offset="20254726">Those detentions are without probable cause and reasonable suspicion, or anything that those persons are involved in criminal activity, but they're reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5027.680" offset="20288790">I believe they do fall under the Fourth Amendment because of the governmental interest involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5030.866" offset="20301537">We are submitting that there is a class of detentions here of persons on or departing from the premises that is reasonable, to insure the full and faithful execution of the warrant, without regard to individualized suspicion as to criminal activity by that person.</text>
            <text syncTime="5044.042" offset="20354305">And it's on that ground that we're asking this Court to hold that that detention, the detention of respondent when he was brought in the house, was constitutional.</text>
