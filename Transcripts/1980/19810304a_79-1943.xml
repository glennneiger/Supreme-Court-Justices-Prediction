            <text syncTime="67.273" offset="415954">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="71.327" offset="432150">This matter involves consolidated matters arising from the 3rd Circuit on appeal from and certiorari to the 3rd Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.718" offset="477708">I'm of counsel in the Alessi v. Raybestos matter, and with the Court's permission I'll address the 203(a) issue of ERISA and Mr. Gettis will then address the preemption question.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.126" offset="527340">The 3rd Circuit decided in this matter that notwithstanding the very broad nonforfeitability guarantees in Section 203(a) of the Pension Reform Act with respect to normal retirement benefits, that a workmen's compensation offset provision in a retirement plan did not violate that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.908" offset="622426">The decision and analysis of the 3rd Circuit has been disagreed with by at least one other circuit, the 6th, and by at least seven district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.380" offset="668402">And I will respectfully suggest that the 3rd Circuit paid excessive attention to form and indeed to the form of a regulation whose nature the intended beneficiary, the IRS, does not agree with.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.274" offset="719915">The fact of the matter in this situation is that normal retirement benefits earned over the life careers, working careers of the affected individuals, have indeed been forfeited, and that is seen very directly by looking at the facts.</text>

            <label>Mr. Theodore Sachs</label>
            <text syncTime="175.828" offset="850109">No, that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.128" offset="855334">There is certain administrative authority with respect to Treasury; there is certain administrative authority with respect to the Department of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.384" offset="888353">But there is none of the kind of administrative or rule making authority which the 3rd Circuit conceived to be applicable and which the Internal Revenue Service renounces.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.858" offset="934224">The Internal Revenue Service does not claim legislative rule making authority which the 3rd Circuit found.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.412" offset="960451">Treasury purports to find that authority in an interpretive basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.466" offset="976751">But the interpretive basis, we submit, is contrary to the statute in question and indeed the argument made by the Government brief here is contrary to the argument which it made below.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.557" offset="1025025">There is a diametrical change in position.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.309" offset="1036101">If I may, the specific facts will highlight how the statutory provision directly works.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.081" offset="1071210">Each of these employees had put in, in the case of Raybestos, more than 30 years when they retired in '72 and '73.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.687" offset="1117603">They earned normal retirement benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.239" offset="1127843">I emphasize there was no disability pension question here; they earned normal retirement benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.526" offset="1148950">Each had reached age 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.045" offset="1158981">Similarly, in the case of the General Motors plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.480" offset="1172774">Each had reached normal retirement age of 65 and had rendered a number of years of service almost as much.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.069" offset="1207151">They in fact began to receive 100 percent of the normal retirement benefits under the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.658" offset="1237453">They did so for several years, and then a funny thing happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.843" offset="1258246">They made an application for partial permanent disability under the New Jersey Workers Compensation Statute and they were awarded that.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.701" offset="1297639">This was for a variety of permanent occupational diseases and injuries, including pulmonary conditions, asbestosis, other serious disabling conditions, and at that point invoking the respective plans, General Motors and Raybestos-Manhattan cut off the pensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.735" offset="1401815">The pensions ceased at that point in an effort at recoupment by both companies of an amount equivalent to the workers' compensation awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.857" offset="1446224">They did so in the case of GM under a plan which is plainly conditioning the benefits upon forbearance from filing that workers comp. claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.649" offset="1485407">If the individuals in the GM plan had not filed for workers' compensation, they would have continued to receive their pension, and indeed had they filed their application for workers' compensation within two years after they had retired, under the plan itself GM could not have claimed an offset.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.876" offset="1562312">So there was a double condition here: one, in the first place, filing for workers' comp. cut off the pension; in the second place, if that claim were not filed within two years, the pension was cut off.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.768" offset="1605884">In the Raybestos plan the specific language begins,</text>
            <text syncTime="369.136" offset="1623334">"Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article 6, the following condition shall apply to the payment of retirement income. "</text>
            <text syncTime="376.726" offset="1653740">And then under this extraordinary clause in the Raybestos plan, a whole array of benefits, collateral benefits, which the employee might receive are then used to invoke a forfeiture to cut off his pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.485" offset="1708806">Not merely workers' compensation or occupational disease, but unemployment compensation, a factor, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, which the Internal Revenue Service itself doesn't recognize; cash sickness benefits, which Internal Revenue has not recognized.</text>

            <text syncTime="449.790" offset="1945998">The Treasury rulings, pre ERISA, which had been invoked by the various defendants here and the various amici supporting their position don't go so far as to permit what Raybestos has done and claimed here, as part of this plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.350" offset="2012245">IRS, we sought to suggest in the briefs and other courts have recognized, has drawn absolutely irrational lines as to what kind of offset is permitted or what kind of offset is not permitted, and all I was meaning to suggest, Your Honor, in my last comment, is that there are elements within the Raybestos plan which don't satisfy even the irrational standards of Treasury, as those had been enunciated in a variety of Treasury rulings.</text>

            <text syncTime="595.233" offset="2527797">But I make the point because there is a claim of reliance, there is a claim on contractual provisions, as though that could somehow overcome the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.472" offset="2560712">But there is no reliance, in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.205" offset="2567713">The point, additionally, that I wanted to make is that the workmen's compensation benefits which was awarded under New Jersey law had no relationship to wage loss, was not dependent on wage loss, and in fact it would have been paid and could have been paid had the claim been made while these men were still working and had not retired.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.986" offset="2642736">So that we ought to dismiss from the picture any suggestion here that they are somehow receiving workmen's comp., something beyond what they otherwise could have received.</text>

            <text syncTime="636.527" offset="2692996">The retirement benefit was earned.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.011" offset="2706893">But, directly responsive to your question, Mr. Justice Stevens, Congress said in enacting this statute that we are dealing here with reform.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.819" offset="2754122">That's why this is called a pension reform act; this is a broad remedial statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.257" offset="2771886">And what Congress wanted to do, and the debates make absolutely clear it wanted to do, was inject notions of equity, so that workers' legitimate expectations could be realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.183" offset="2831549">And there were two particular areas in the matter of vesting that we're talking about, in addition to the other remedies this statute was designed to achieve which are pertinent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.522" offset="2868957">When we're talking about vesting, what Congress wanted to assure is, one, that when the time for retirement came, there would be money in the coffers to pay the pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.711" offset="2909708">And that's what this Court dealt with in Nachman.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.080" offset="2919112">And the other thing Congress wanted to do was to make sure that the small print would not take away what the employee anticipated over his working career he was in fact going to receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.004" offset="2962893">And that is why, based upon the findings of Congress, that workers with long years of service and significant periods of service were losing the retirement benefits on which they had planned for a working career lifetime.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.263" offset="3023915">Congress enunciated an extraordinarily broad rule in Section 203(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="724.751" offset="3045858">It's stated that all is forbidden except which we permit with respect to normal retirement benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.371" offset="3076369">203(a) says that a worker is entitled, and coupling this with definitions in (3), part 19, of the Act,</text>
            <text syncTime="741.477" offset="3112731">"a worker is entitled to an unconditional right to fulfillment of his normal retirement benefit when he reaches normal retirement age and when he attains any of the alternative minimum mandatory vesting schedules of the Act. "</text>
            <text syncTime="765.561" offset="3209071">Now, when Congress intended exceptions it said what it wanted to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.648" offset="3233417">And in 203(a)(3) it stated the exceptions which it was willing to recognize, and this is not one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.052" offset="3263092">Congress did not permit any exception for workers' compensation, never; never in this Act, never before this Act, never in any pre ERISA history has Congress ever acknowledged the euphemism which is used by the defendants that this has something to do with integration, the euphemism with which the 3rd Circuit was, unfortunately, taken.</text>

            <text syncTime="944.140" offset="3923363">Congress didn't see this as a solution, it saw it as a problem, that of social security benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.376" offset="3940395">And the compromise which Congress reached in enacting ERISA was to say for the moment, we'll freeze social security levels of integration so that if they go up, you can't cut down the amount of pension which is otherwise going to be payable.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.869" offset="3994312">But the point, Your Honor, is they addressed social security as such, explicitly legislated on social security as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.239" offset="4023778">The 3rd Circuit somehow had the notion that we were claiming that if you can't fix social security under one of the sections to 203(a), it can't stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.447" offset="4060663">Social security integration doesn't relate to 203(a) and isn't dependent on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.532" offset="4076963">It is independently dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.301" offset="4088039">Social security came into the picture again in 1942, and has been carried forward in the Tax Code for totally unrelated reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.057" offset="4119073">Treasury was never in the business of evaluating the fairness of workers' benefits or assuring that they would not be lost except only in the context, very peripherally, of making sure under 401(a), which is the section on tax preference for pension plans, of making sure that there would not be discrimination in favor of higher compensated persons and officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.774" offset="4225966">As part of that analysis, Congress in permitting the supplementing of social security benefits said, okay, we recognize that if we permit the so called integration, lower compensated employees might lose out; we'll make an exception in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.536" offset="4300989">They did it in '42 and they continued it ever after.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.654" offset="4313424">In 1974 and in preceding years, when Congress considered adoption of this statute, they were very much concerned about that, and they thought there was a social problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.009" offset="4350831">But they also recognized that there were cost factors as to social security, and the compromise is what I have indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.013" offset="4374864">But that whole discrete history has absolutely nothing to do with this entire new set of regulations which Congress imposed under 203(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.902" offset="4418436">It recognized it was dealing with new standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.554" offset="4429094">Indeed, in the 3rd Circuit analysis, it carried the social security comparison so far as to say, well, you can have social security disability offsets against normal retirement benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.628" offset="4469322">And again, it unfortunately was persuaded of something that can't be a fact, because social security disability benefits end at age 65 and retirement benefits begin, your normal retirement, at 65.</text>

            <text syncTime="1188.163" offset="4899507">We've agreed all along that Section 514 does provide for broad preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.217" offset="4919673">However, we find it remarkable that all but one of these briefs virtually ignore the existence of Section 4(b)(3) of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.371" offset="4952274">That section provides an express exception to preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.942" offset="4966589">Among other things, it exempts pension plans maintained solely to comply with state workers' compensation laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.846" offset="4994175">It exempts these plans from Title I, and Section 514 is a provision of Title I of ERISA.</text>

            <text syncTime="1289.779" offset="5305972">But other than the decision of the 3rd Circuit below, no case has held a state workers' compensation statute preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.552" offset="5337006">In fact, one district court and one court of appeals, the 9th Circuit, has recognized workers' compensation laws of states as an exception to the preemption doctrine of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.442" offset="5380578">The focus of the inquiry under 4(b)(3) should not be, as our adversaries suggest, whether a plan is exempt under 4(b)(3).</text>

            <text syncTime="1320.250" offset="5427807">If a plan maintained to comply with a state workers' compensation law is exempt from ERISA preemption, a fortiori the underlying workers' compensation statute must be preempted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1419.812" offset="5826122">In the area of domestic relations and support, preemption challenges have been litigated under ERISA where a state court has ordered a pensioner's pension benefits to be garnished or severed to satisfy that worker's obligations under state laws, either support obligations or community property laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.908" offset="5914521">Two courts of appeals, both the 2nd Circuit and the 9th Circuit, have held that such state laws are not preempted under ERISA, that these laws only marginally affect pension plans and are within an area of strong state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.402" offset="5968437">One court of appeals which has not permitted a state court to garnish a pension has done so under Section 206 of ERISA, and did not engage in any preemption analysis of the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.292" offset="6015980">We agree with our adversaries' contention that ERISA preemption is intended to assist in the congressional goal of providing for uniform regulation of pension plans, but our adversaries incorrectly assert that the New Jersey law in question frustrates this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.469" offset="6076689">In fact, it is the use of the pension offset by General Motors and Raybestos-Manhattan which frustrates this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.956" offset="6106677">Due to the offset of workers' compensation benefits, the pension benefits may vary from state to state, depending on the particular workers' compensation statutory scheme in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.614" offset="6149309">A finding that Chapter 156 of the New Jersey Laws of 1977 is valid, if anything would assist in achieving the congressional goal of uniformity of pension plan regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.154" offset="6195494">Our adversaries have tailored their arguments depending upon which issue in this case they're addressing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.558" offset="6221094">When arguing that Chapter 156 of the New Jersey statutes is preempted, our adversaries claim that New Jersey is attempting to regulate pension plans and such regulation is not permitted by ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.366" offset="6268323">When arguing against nonforfeitability under ERISA, our adversaries suggest that ERISA does not protect state workers' compensation awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.472" offset="6308761">It is clear that the New Jersey statute in question protects workers' compensation awards whereas ERISA protects pension benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.160" offset="6339481">These are separate benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.612" offset="6353273">Even if this Court should find that Section 203 does not prohibit the offset in question, which of course petitioners strongly suggest it does, Chapter 156 of the New Jersey Laws would still stand as a valid exercise of the state police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.655" offset="6417430">Even if this Court were to hold Section 203 not prohibiting the offset, it still cannot in any way be said that the permitting of such offset was a congressional purpose in enacting ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.363" offset="6464242">Congress clearly set forth its purposes in Section 2 of ERISA to prohibit certain abuses which had taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.019" offset="6498932">They set forth vesting standards, minimum funding standards, disclosure requirements, and fiduciary requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.855" offset="6526309">In no way did Congress show any intent to permit offsets of workers' compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.543" offset="6548983">Therefore, the state law in its attempt to protect workers' compensation benefits does not in any way stand as an obstacle to the attainment of congressional objectives and goals which Congress had in mind when enacting ERISA.</text>

            <text syncTime="1750.871" offset="7150322">The issue before the court: is the right of a defined pension plan such as the General Motors and Raybestos-Manhattan plans to continue since ERISA as before, to integrate workers' compensation benefits with pension plan benefits?</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.583" offset="7221166">Integration describes a benefit structure by which a pension plan takes into account employer financed benefits under a governmental benefit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.741" offset="7277799">In determining employer financed pension plan benefits, whether by way of reduction or offset, the right of integration of benefits proceeds from the basic structure of pension plans in the United States, the fundamental proposition that whether an employer furnishes post retirement income to its employees and how much that employer furnishes to its employees is a matter of determination in the first instance by the employer and in the case of a collectively bargained plan, such as the two plans involved in these cases, a matter of contract between the employer and the union representing the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.542" offset="7485002">Integration has been an integral part of pension plan benefit structure in the United States since at least 1942 when it was expressly approved by what is now Section 401(a)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.221" offset="7555742">Social security is indeed the most universal and ubiquitous of these benefits that is integrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.229" offset="7607778">However, it is by no means the only benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.766" offset="7621884">Another is railroad retirement benefits, and third is workers' compensation benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.902" offset="7654485">In 1968 workers' compensation benefits were held subject to integration by the Internal Revenue Service in a ruling, Revenue Ruling 68-243.</text>

            <text syncTime="1964.760" offset="8005884">Now, the concept of nonforfeitability did not spring out of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.566" offset="8045068">Indeed, it existed at the time ERISA was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.720" offset="8061682">It dates back at least to Section 401(a)(7) which was introduced into the Internal Revenue Code in 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.726" offset="8101701">Section 401(a)(7) at that time provided merely for nonforfeitability upon plan termination or discontinuance of contributions, saying essentially the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.569" offset="8157081">ERISA, indeed, expanded the application of the concept of nonforfeitability contained in Section 401(a)(7).</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.077" offset="8199190">Now, as Mr. Justice Stevens' question, I think, observed, the 3rd Circuit's argument in its opinion was that Section 203(a) if it is deemed to include workers' compensation integration as a forfeiture must include every integrated offset as a forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.966" offset="8350700">To do that requires ignoring the plain evidence in ERISA that Congress did not intend to disturb social security integration, which is merely one of the integrating offsets available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.512" offset="8416842">That evidence exists in Section 401(a)(15) of the Code and Section 206(b) of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.433" offset="8452578">Contrary to the petitioners' and appellants' argument, those sections do not authorize social security or railroad retirement benefit integration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.591" offset="8505241">They merely describe a limitation upon that integration, a limitation, moreover, which was neither new to ERISA... on the contrary, the legislative history makes clear that the two sections merely codified with a slight extension the preexisting IRS administrative practice on limiting social security integration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.398" offset="8644421">Now, Section 203(a) requires that the employee's right to his normal retirement benefit be nonforfeitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.254" offset="8675873">It does not say what that normal retirement benefit is to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.141" offset="8695412">Neither does the Section 3(19) definition of nonforfeitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.478" offset="8720803">It merely refers to the benefit under the plan, as does the Section 3(22) definition of normal retirement benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.534" offset="8760927">Therefore what is nonforfeitable is the benefit which the plan provides; in this case that benefit has never been anything other than a benefit integrated with workers' compensation benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.045" offset="8831040">And, indeed, since Mr. Sachs has referred to the time span within which this particular provision has been in the General Motors pension plan, I should call to the Court's attention that it was in the General Motors hourly rate pension plan, the plan before the Court, from 1950 to 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.328" offset="8924140">It was absent from 1961 to 1970.</text>

            <text syncTime="3103.704" offset="12561639">On the vesting question I'd like to address three short points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.775" offset="12577940">I think it's important to keep in mind that we're dealing with private contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.827" offset="12594135">Agreements by the private parties deal in their own way with economic security during retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.297" offset="12616078">In agreeing to set up a retirement plan for its employees, the employer faces two competing interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.051" offset="12643037">The employees want the employer to agree to pay them and to assure them some level of monthly income during retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.104" offset="12667278">The employer as a businessman is willing to incur some level of retirement costs for his employees but no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.025" offset="12694968">The private retirement contract reflects how these two competing interests, retirement costs and monthly payments, were balanced by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.281" offset="12724016">The benefit agreed upon under the Raybestos plan is an integrated benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.185" offset="12743556">The plan takes into account any benefits paid by Raybestos during retirement under the workers' compensation program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.956" offset="12774694">This was the benefit decided upon by the parties in collective bargaining as stated in the plan document, both before and after ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.795" offset="12806041">The vesting rules, which are at issue here, operate on that integrated benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.031" offset="12826939">The right to that integrated benefit, whether the plan integrates with social security, railroad retirement, or as here, the benefits paid by Raybestos at the same time during retirement under the workers' compensation program, the right to that integrated benefit vests and is nonforfeitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.708" offset="12889633">The plan assure a defined level of monthly income during retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.643" offset="12905411">There is never any moment when the plan participant does not receive that monthly income during retirement assured by the private plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.849" offset="12938220">When, for example, the plan member's also receiving certain periodic income under the workers' compensation program during retirement, and that statutory payment ceases for whatever reason or is even taken away retroactively, the private plan assures a defined monthly benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.775" offset="13001959">There is never a moment when that assured monthly benefit is conditional or not fully enforceable against the private plan.</text>

            <label>Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="3221.297" offset="13032052">Are you saying that the Raybestos collective bargaining contract expressly contemplated workmen's compensation payments as a part of the pension plan?</text>

            <label>Mr. Warren J. Casey</label>
            <text syncTime="3233.022" offset="13078968">Exactly, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.855" offset="13082312">The employer takes into account any other periodic income under the workers' compensation program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.876" offset="13106344">It did not, for example, offset with social security, which was another permissible offset.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.528" offset="13124944">Rather, the employer took into account that a plan member may also be receiving by Raybestos certain periodic income under the workers' compensation program during retirement, and it assures each plan member, it addresses the economic security for each plan member.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.421" offset="13192549">In setting up the plan it assures each employee who vests this defined level of monthly income assured by the private plan, and the right to that integrated benefit; whether it's zero or $100 a month, it's an integrated benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.199" offset="13255660">The right to that integrated benefit, to that monthly income assured by the private plan is nonforfeitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.819" offset="13282096">This integration was approved prior to ERISA, first in the 1968 Revenue Ruling, which Mr. Reich alluded to, and also in the comprehensive guides for pension plan qualification which were published and republished during Congress's consideration of the ERISA bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.215" offset="13359732">Those comprehensive guides brought together in a simple approach the general requirements of the Government for the qualification of retirement plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.505" offset="13396826">They stated what integration with what statutory income programs during retirement may be permissible under the Tax Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.892" offset="13430367">ERISA is a highly technical, highly specific statute, the result of a decade of study of the private retirement system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.715" offset="13465685">When Congress intended to effect subsequent changes in the existing rules, it acted with precision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.352" offset="13488255">Nowhere in the statute or in the thousands of pages of legislative history did Congress ever prohibit this integrated benefit or did it ever suggest to the Treasury Department and to the private parties who draft these contracts that the integrated benefit should be prohibited under the vesting rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.730" offset="13553770">It simply never was, prior to ERISA, nor was there any time after ERISA, was there any inconsistency between a private plan agreeing to provide an integrated benefit during retirement, fully financed by the plan's sponsor, and the entirely separate requirement that the employee's property right to that integrated benefit must at all times be unconditional and fully enforceable against the private plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.796" offset="13650005">There is never any reduction in the monthly income assured by Raybestos under the private plan, and all paid by Raybestos.</text>

            <text syncTime="3382.883" offset="13678322">Mr. Casey, how do you... do you have an answer to Mr. Gettis's argument based on 4(b)(3)?</text>

            <text syncTime="3389.438" offset="13704549">Your Honor, Mr. Gettis basically argues that ERISA does not preempt and includes express relief from preemption for any state law related to retirement plans so long as it is part of the workers' compensation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.748" offset="13765884">This simply misstates the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.914" offset="13774452">The statute relieves from all the coverage provisions of ERISA, including the vesting funding, any plan that's maintained solely to comply with the workers' compensation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.203" offset="13815621">As Mr. Gettis stated and it has always been agreed, that these plans simply are not maintained solely to comply with the workers' compensation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.910" offset="13858462">This 1977 New Jersey statute directly prohibits a private plan from providing a benefit during retirement integrated with other benefits the private employer pays at the same time, concurrently, periodically, with that retirement income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.920" offset="13922514">It directly regulates these private retirement plans and directly regulates the terms and conditions of the retirement plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.193" offset="13951562">It affects nothing else other than retirement plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.228" offset="13963788">For that reason it's preempted under 4(b) assertion.</text>

            <label>Mr. Warren J. Casey</label>
            <text syncTime="3468.185" offset="14019585">Justice Brennan, under most state workers' compensation laws, an employer may either pay into a state fund an insurance premium which will then fund the periodic income for the disability or it may make arrangements with a private insurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.966" offset="14098684">The third possibility is for an employer to be a self insurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.251" offset="14115820">In order to be a self insurer he just can't say, I'm going to agree to pay these benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.257" offset="14143824">He has to, I believe in just about every state, have an approved plan, a plan approved by the state, which specifies what, for example, the claims processing procedures often are part of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.401" offset="14220415">But assuming--</text>

            <text syncTime="3518.868" offset="14222295">Is there anything in the legislative history of 4(b)(3) to show us that kind of plan and only that kind of plan was in the reach of 4(b)(3)?</text>

            <text syncTime="3528.026" offset="14258971">--As I recall, the legislative history in that provision is very scant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.061" offset="14271092">However, as I recall, the legislative history does note that there was no reason to worry about the vesting and funding of these plans, because they're totally divorced from a private employer plan which is voluntary, are going to provide a period income benefit during retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.755" offset="14337861">This Raybestos plan was a collectively bargained plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.074" offset="14363148">This was a benefit, it was a voluntary plan between the union and the employer, agreed to in 1967.</text>

            <text syncTime="3574.922" offset="14446531">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.674" offset="14453531">I would submit that it's an extraordinary mode of interpreting a pension reform law to look at prior practices which we submit Congress intended to end, because they were abuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.664" offset="14497522">Now, it's been suggested to you that nothing has changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.433" offset="14508597">I suggest to you that by this Act everything has changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.918" offset="14522495">In the first place, those practices which are sought to be escalated here into justification for continuation of the practices were never permissible before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.724" offset="14561783">26 U.S.C. 401(a)(5) which appears at 1a of appellants' Appendix indicates that this word integration, which doesn't appear in the plan, but it's the euphemism which now permeates all the briefs... 401(a)(5) says that the difference may be permitted</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.070" offset="14639105">"because of any retirement benefits created under state or federal law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.091" offset="14663242">Now, the U.S. brief to the 3rd Circuit acknowledged that the word retirement had to be read into the regulation it was relying on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.497" offset="14696784">Unless the conclusion can be reached that men suffer disabilities and occupational injuries and occupational diseases as part of a claimed retirement plan, it makes a mockery of this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.238" offset="14751745">In fact, we demonstrated in the brief, in our reply brief citing the legislative history... page 8 of appellants' reply brief, that Congress intended in 203(a) supplemental and additional requirements, in addition to 401(a)(5), even a 401(a)(5) as a tax measure for anti discrimination... totally unrelated purposes... made any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.203" offset="14843696">But I am constrained to point out to the Court in the light of the argument made that there is a misquotation in the appellees' brief, I'm sure inadvertent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.659" offset="14881522">But if you will look at page 26 of the brief of appellees, which talks about the alleged change, fact that there is no change, the sentence reads, purporting to quote from the committee report:</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.817" offset="14930109">"Moreover, the conferees intend that the anti discrimination rules of present law are not to be changed. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.054" offset="14959053">The legislative history, at 3 Legislative History 4544, inserts after the word "law" the phrase,</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.742" offset="14993848">"in areas other than the vesting schedule. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.144" offset="15007432">So the sentence should read:</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.730" offset="15013806">"Moreover, the conferees intend that the anti discrimination rules of present law in areas other than the vesting schedule are not to be changed. "</text>
