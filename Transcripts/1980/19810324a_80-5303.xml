            <text syncTime="473.621" offset="2043004">The 9th Circuit to a great extent agreed with us on that point, that there was a general requirement of comparability between the medically and categorically needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.619" offset="2086994">Where the 9th Circuit disagreed, however, was in determining that the transfer rule was not necessarily a violation of the comparability requirement, as there were other rules which were the same between the categorically and medically needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.472" offset="2142478">Therefore, the 9th Circuit determined that one different rule wouldn't necessarily violate a comparability requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="831.164" offset="3473260">So that within three months of the transfer she was found eligible for Medicaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.007" offset="3492591">About ten months later she was forced to go into the nursing home.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.926" offset="3512235">At that time, of course, her homemaker chore services were cut off.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.894" offset="3528117">For reasons which have never been clarified, she remained eligible for Medi-Cal until August of 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.235" offset="3557479">She was then found ineligible and she reapplied two months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.061" offset="3584751">At that time she was forced to apply as a medically needy individual, not a categorically needy individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.840" offset="3611918">Several months after that the state for the first time found her ineligible for Medicaid, based on the transfer of assets which had taken place in February, 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.365" offset="3654028">Thus, in the course of two years, she was first... after the transfer, she was first found eligible for Medicaid as categorically needy, and then found ineligible for Medicaid as medically needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.955" offset="3700421">After being denied eligibility she filed a motion to intervene in the then-pending Dawson v. Beach case, which was on the verge of being resolved by summary judgment motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.137" offset="3745143">The defendants did not oppose that motion, and she was permitted to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.418" offset="3762175">I should also add, it's not on the record, but I think it would be helpful for the Court to know that after the 9th Circuit's decision in May, 1980, Mrs. Beltran reapplied for medically needy eligibility on the premise that the period of ineligibility which the state had previously determined was too long.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.190" offset="3841273">She was found eligible at that time, retroactive to March 1, 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.140" offset="3865097">As a result, Mrs. Beltran's period of ineligibility ran for 16 months, from September, 1978, to February, 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.590" offset="3898952">During that period, as I've noted, she ran up nursing home bills of just under.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.168" offset="3913267">$15,000 and those bills remain unpaid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1063.198" offset="4401339">That statute essentially says that except for income and resources, this individual is identical with an SSI recipient, is identical with someone eligible for categorical coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.020" offset="4448673">The statute essentially asks the state to make this inquiry: but for this individual's income and resources, which are over the categorical levels, would this individual be eligible for SSI?</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.452" offset="4506351">If the answer is SSI recipient, the same is a categorically needy individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.308" offset="4537802">Consequently, HHS has determined regularly and repeatedly that on the basis of this statute a state cannot apply more restrictive rules to the medically needy than to the categorically needy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1350.894" offset="5552085">42 CFR Section 435.401(c)(2) implements the statute by stating with no exception that a state cannot apply more restrictive rules to the medically needy than to the categorically needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.060" offset="5616764">That is the general rule and it is set out quite explicitly in the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.463" offset="5634423">Specifically, HHS has implemented this policy in 435.840(a) and.841(a) by saying that a state must use the most liberal resource standards in determining medically needy eligibility which are used in the categorical programs of AFDC or SSI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.659" offset="5719164">Obviously, if there's no transfer rule applicable to SSI recipients, the most liberal resource standard would be no transfer rule for medically needy applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.997" offset="5764513">Furthermore, in 435.845(b), the regulation specifically requires that in determining available income and resources a state can only look to those resources which the individual has at present or up to six months in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.928" offset="5836297">It forbids a state implicitly to look at any resource which the individual had in the past, regardless of why the individual no longer has that resource.</text>

            <text syncTime="1569.477" offset="6426455">The Public Law 96-611, Section 5, which was passed by Congress in December of 1980 does modify the congressional policy towards transfer of assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.785" offset="6479641">It allows a state to implement a rule which denies eligibility to a Medicaid recipient who has transferred assets in the past with the intent of attaining eligibility for Medicaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.982" offset="6528437">I think it is very important to recognize, however, that that statute continues the general congressional policy that the medically need should be treated no more restrictively than the categorically needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.947" offset="6572323">Congress still requires that both the medically needy and categorically needy be treated the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.851" offset="6595938">A state would not be able to apply that transfer rule to only one group or the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="1636.357" offset="6693949">Consequently, the present law, whatever that is, will be in effect until that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.199" offset="6717355">So there are people now in California who have been and will continue to be denied eligibility based on the present California transfer of assets rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1654.552" offset="6766779">I wondered what... isn't the general importance of the issue on which the courts of appeal have divided, much less as a result of the Boren-Long Amendment?</text>

            <text syncTime="1665.268" offset="6809620">The general importance in terms of the amount of money involved both to the state and federal governments is obviously reduced because states will now be able to deny eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.201" offset="6845355">On the other hand, the general rule of the importance of comparability between the medically needy and the categorically needy remains an important issue in a number of other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.868" offset="6880046">Moreover, there are thousands of Californians who have been affected by this transfer rule who are presumably members of this class, and who now owe nursing homes many thousands of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.410" offset="6930201">So it remains significant in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.910" offset="6940232">I admit that, obviously, since this law will change on July 1, it does not have the same significance it had when this Court granted cert in November.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.312" offset="6977848">I would just remind the Court that we did make a motion summarily to reverse this case after the new statute came down and the Court denied that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.559" offset="7014837">We felt that the new statute, and still do, explicitly suggests, at least in the legislative history, that the entire focus of the new legislation is to replace a vacuum, that prior to the new legislation a state could not utilize a transfer of assets rule but now under the new legislation effective July 1 it can utilize a transfer rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.690" offset="7103340">And to corroborate that entire impression, the present California law violates controlling federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1890.097" offset="7708963">Supposing the transfer is of sufficient assets to bring the transferor down into an income level that will make him or her eligible for SSI benefits, would he not then be eligible under Subparagraph (a)?</text>

            <text syncTime="2136.920" offset="8696183">The state must provide medical assistance to a statutorily defined group of needy persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.542" offset="8726694">This group is called the categorically needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.774" offset="8739651">Now, to qualify as categorically needy, two criteria must be satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.039" offset="8756682">First, the individual must be aged, blind, or disabled, and secondly he must qualify for financial assistance under either one of two welfare programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.128" offset="8797015">This includes the SSI program, the supplemental security income for aged, blind, and disabled under Title XVI; or the Aid to Families with Dependent Children under Title IV(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.890" offset="8840065">Now, it should be noted here that the categorically needy are eligible for financial assistance under these programs because they do not have the wherewithal to pay for their own essentials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.401" offset="8882175">Of necessity it makes sense that states be required to provide medical assistance to these individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.804" offset="8907775">Now, there is another group of individuals, and this is what this lawsuit is all about, the medically needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.036" offset="8928673">Now, states have the option of covering the medically needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.801" offset="8943719">We should emphasize the states have the option of participating in the Medicaid program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.252" offset="8961587">So, arguably it was never the intent of Congress that the medically needy get benefits automatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.500" offset="8982589">States would have to participate in the program first, and then the states would have to opt to serve this group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.983" offset="9004532">Now, the medically needy consists of all the individuals who would qualify for SSI or AFDC except they have sufficient income and resources to cover their essentials apart from their medical expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.430" offset="9062315">So, conceivably, anyone can be considered a potentially medically needy person, anyone with substantial assets facing potentially substantial medical expenses could fall into this class so long as they are aged, blind, or disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.455" offset="9114351">Now, they begin to receive medical assistance after they incur medical expenses which reduce their income and assets below a prescribed level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.653" offset="9175164">So the medically needy must incur medical expenses before they become eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.181" offset="9197316">That's a very important difference, and the reason for that is because they have sufficient income and resources or, arguably, they have sufficient income and resources which will be applied toward their medical expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.365" offset="9237962">Now, California has obviously chosen to participate in the Medi-Cal program, and as I indicated, the state plan has been approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.940" offset="9268264">And California has opted to provide this coverage to this medically needy group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.376" offset="9286028">Many states don't even get into coverage to medically needy individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.156" offset="9297208">As part of its plan California has adopted the transfer of assets rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.123" offset="9317061">Now, what is this rule?</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.388" offset="9322077">The transfer of assets rule creates a rebuttable presumption that any transfer of assets for less than adequate consideration within two years prior to applying was made with the intent to qualify for medical assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.287" offset="9389682">Now, to rebut the presumption, the applicant may produce evidence that adequate resources were available at the time of the transfer for their support and medical care considering such things as the applicant's competency and life expectancy and health at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.717" offset="9459376">If the applicant fails to rebut the presumption, then the states can deny benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2357.814" offset="9579853">Her eligibility was estimated as a great period of time but as it turned out it was only for a couple of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.125" offset="9601064">Now, the facts in this case are that Mrs. Beltran had sufficient assets that could have been used to support her present need, medical needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.090" offset="9640875">She had them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.653" offset="9643174">However, she transferred her assets for less than adequate consideration with the intent to qualify for assistance and this transfer was made to her children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.180" offset="9681313">Now what's very important here is that she never bothered to request a fair hearing to produce evidence to rebut the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.786" offset="9715690">In fact, the facts here are a bit confusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.487" offset="9730527">We don't know what... arguably Mrs. Beltran could have rebutted the presumption if she could have shown at the time that she had sufficient assets to meet her present needs considering such things as her health and life expectancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.967" offset="9784444">So she didn't even bother to request a fair hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.700" offset="9791340">Now, she was disqualified for medical assistance under the medically needy program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.087" offset="9812865">We submit that the purpose of the transfer of assets rule is consistent with the Medicaid program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.492" offset="9842540">As I indicated, it's to protect the public treasury and to insure the benefits of aid to those truly in need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.208" offset="9869394">Now, it should be noted here that without the transfer of assets rule aged, blind, and disabled individuals would be able to transfer their assets and not use them to defray the cost of their medical expenses, thus encumbering the program with substantial expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.061" offset="9928744">Now, it should be noted that nationwide, aged, blind, and disabled individuals become most likely to require hospital, skilled nursing and intermediate care facility services, which are the most costly under the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.149" offset="9981198">Individuals who in addition, elderly individuals who enter nursing homes, may remain there for a long period of time or, unfortunately, permanently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.755" offset="10015575">In New York, for example, it is estimated that a single month of nursing care was as much as $2,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.268" offset="10037623">per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.674" offset="10039295">So this is really a very significant group of benefits we're talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.626" offset="10055073">Now, the transfer of assets rule also has another purpose that discourages the intentional divestment of assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.795" offset="10079732">That is, it prevents individuals with substantial assets from transferring their property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.324" offset="10097809">Now, the Senate Finance Committee, interestingly enough, noted that the transfer of assets in good faith... you know, you didn't know about Medi-Cal, you didn't know about benefits... is really very rare.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.445" offset="10138351">It's rare, and... as the Senate Finance Committee found out, also, the transfer of assets rule by some courts has been found to implement another important policy procedure under the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.518" offset="10182655">That procedure is a fraud preventive measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.705" offset="10195402">Now, arguably, the transfer of assets rule is not in the type of fraud that we normally think of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.797" offset="10215778">However, an application for medical assistance made after a transfer of assets is a type of misrepresentation as to the applicant's available resources.</text>

            <text syncTime="3020.078" offset="12228878">No, I would submit that this excepts our income and resource standards, that they don't have to be the same, that you could have a transfer of assets restriction and this would be similar, but not necessarily identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.119" offset="12281019">Now, the transfer of assets rule is also consistent with 42 USC Section 1396a (a)(17)(B).</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.567" offset="12334831">Now, this section requires that only available income and resources considered in making eligibility determinations be considered under the Medicaid program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.361" offset="12374015">Now, when you look at this statute, which is also supposed to conflict with the transfer of assets provision, we notice that there is no plain preclusion of the transfer of assets rule in this section either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.355" offset="12418005">Now, there is nothing in the legislative history which prevents the consideration of a transferred asset as available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.212" offset="12445381">In fact, the purpose of the availability rule prevents the counting of assets of a relative as available to the applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.771" offset="12475683">Transfer of assets rule... this section is not meant to apply to a person who manufactures eligibility by giving away assets that could be used for medical expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.550" offset="12514762">Now, the transfer of assets rule is also consistent with a federal regulation which the petitioners cite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.891" offset="12540153">This is 42 CFR, Section 435.401(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.699" offset="12571396">Now this section in effect provides that states not use requirements for determining eligibility for the medically needy which are more restrictive than those used for the categorically needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.413" offset="12618207">Now, we submit that this section does not apply to a financial eligibility requirement such as the transfer of assets rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.613" offset="12651017">We base this opinion as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.237" offset="12661466">The section was found under the general heading and title,</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.517" offset="12674632">"Subpart (e), General Eligibility Requirements. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.969" offset="12688424">Now Subpart (e) does not apply to financial eligibility conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.546" offset="12706710">It applies to citizenship, alienage, or state residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.371" offset="12726041">Now, further support for this interpretation is found in a prior wording of that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.181" offset="12749237">The prior wording specifically states that it is meant to refer to nonfinancial eligibility requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.772" offset="12783615">Now, it's very interesting to note is that within Part 435 of the CFRs, Subpart (i) specifically covers financial eligibility requirements for the medically needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.970" offset="12828441">In this section it would be logical you would see a transfer of assets restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.235" offset="12845473">There is no such restriction in Subpart (i) which specifically deals with income and resource requirements for the medically needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.105" offset="12876924">I would like to also discuss the Boren/Long Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.415" offset="12906181">Now, it has been argued that the Boren/Long Amendment precludes the imposition of a transfer of assets rule prior to the enactment of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.145" offset="12945156">Now, the law itself was signed into effect on December 28, 1980, and has been designated Public Law 96-611, Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.533" offset="12986638">It's interesting to note that it not only permits transfer of assets rules in a Title XIX program but it also permits them in a Title XVI program, the SSI-SSP programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.121" offset="13033032">Now, it's also very interesting to note is that Congress in these provisions of the Boren/Long Amendment, these provisions are very similar to California's transfer of assets restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.570" offset="13078798">There are some differences but they are very similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.772" offset="13087680">Congress's intent in enacting this Boren/Long Amendment was to correct an abusive practice whereby individuals transfer substantial assets to relatives to qualify for medical assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.673" offset="13143268">So Congress recognized the problem that California had noted all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.171" offset="13157270">Now, it should be noted that not every amendment of a statute demonstrates legislative intent to make a change in the substance of a preexisting law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.260" offset="13201574">We would submit that the Boren/Long Amendment constitutes an exclusive permission to the states to impose a transfer of assets rule, and this is further buttressed by the fact that certain reports of the Senate Finance Committee suggest that the Amendment was the result of congressional desire to remedy the effect of erroneous court decisions striking down the rule, so apparently Congress was aware at this time of these decisions perhaps in the 2nd and 4th Circuits striking down the rule and said, we don't want to give credibility to those decisions, we are enacting this provision, and we want to make sure that it is not intended to show that we agree with those decisions striking down the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.259" offset="13369593">Based on the foregoing, the 9th Circuit opinion should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.864" offset="13408046">If there are no more questions, this concludes our presentation.</text>
