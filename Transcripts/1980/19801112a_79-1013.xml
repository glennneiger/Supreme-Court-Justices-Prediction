            <label>Mr. Louis Bender</label>
            <text syncTime="50.783" offset="335617">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please this Honorable Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="55.385" offset="354007">The question before this Court is a single point, referred to in Point 1 of petitioner's brief, and that is whether the pledge of securities as collateral for a loan is a sale or a purchase for the purpose of invoking the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.141" offset="489008">It is our contention that the pledge is not a sale or purchase under either the 1933 definition of the anti-fraud provisions of the Act, or under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the 1934 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.404" offset="578033">The pledge occurred in this case as the result of series of loans totaling approximately $475,000, by Tri-State Energy, a corporation, by whom petitioner was employed from October 19th, 1972, through December 6th, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.776" offset="703526">That is to say, the loans were obtained over that period, October 19th, 1972, through December the 6th, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.731" offset="743336">The loans were evidenced by promissory notes that were executed by the borrower corporation and were individually guaranteed by some of the officers, including the petitioner who was not a stockholder of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.014" offset="840512">Side collateral was given for the loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.818" offset="859738">And at page 8 of petitioner's brief, the principal witness for the government, an employee of the bank, describes his definition of side collateral to be: that when the loan was made initially the loan was envisioned that it would be repaid from the ongoing operations of the corporation, namely from the sale of coal or natural gas, the collateral was taken as a secondary source of repayment in the event that the primary source, the ongoing operations of the corporation didn't materialize.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.311" offset="1021697">Also given by the borrowers at the time were blank stock powers, corporate resolutions authorizing the pledging and hypothecation of securities of the stock as security for the loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.337" offset="1085749">The loan was defaulted, and I don't think it's disputed here that the bank sued the petitioner in the state court, in New York, on the promissory note based upon his individual guaranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.282" offset="1149593">The evidence of the lawsuit is set forth in the joint appendix at 174(a), which is an affidavit of confession of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.638" offset="1190971">It is undisputed that there was no foreclosure of the securities by the bank, so that actually this Court does not really have to reach any interest in what may have occurred, or interest in the securities as to what may occur if there was a foreclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.587" offset="1282817">To that extent, the Fifth and the Seventh Circuit Courts which support petitioner's position here, and goes that far, we submit, is unnecessary for this Court's decision any more than the Second Circuit Court's decision in Mallis, Bankers Trust Company against Mallis, which considers the release of the security by the bank or the pledgee as being a sale within the anti-fraud provisions, is likewise unnecessary to reach the decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.795" offset="1431611">The charge is set forth, that is, the indictment in this case, is set forth in page 3 of petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.186" offset="1481139">This was a conspiracy plus two substantive counts, Counts I, II, and III.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.757" offset="1511441">The conspiracy encompassed a charge of violating three objects: the only one that we're concerned with is the one which charged a violation of Section 17(a)(1) in the offer and sale of a security, pursuant to a scheme to defraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.472" offset="1606318">And that was under Section 77X of the 1933 Securities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.930" offset="1644143">I should add that petitioner was acquitted of the substantive charge in Count III, which was a violation of Section 17(a)(1) of the 1933 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.254" offset="1701403">He was convicted of the conspiracy which encompassed the three objects.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.891" offset="1720002">With respect to the second count which was a substantive count, also one of the objects of the conspiracy, to defraud the bank of the half million dollars in violation of Section 1014 of Title 18, the jury had... and incidentally, which subsumed all of the alleged fraud in the pledging of the securities in Count I, and that appears at page 28 of our brief footnote in the statement of the prosecutor, the jury did not reach a verdict on Count II.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.885" offset="1879976">But the prosecutor, after the jury had convicted of conspiracy, agreed to concede to a judgment of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.491" offset="1918429">Petitioner does not mount any challenge to the fraud alleged in this case, and of course, that's prominently brought out by my learned brother; but the fact is that since the issue, we feel, is one of law, we assume the fraud for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.010" offset="2040473">It does not necessarily mean that we concede the fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.497" offset="2062416">Petitioner contends that no matter how the fraud alleged in the pledge of the collateral, the pledge transaction did not constitute a sale under Section 17(a)(1) of the 1933 Act or Section 10b or Rule 10b-5 of the 1934 Act, and that therefore, the conviction must be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.301" offset="2189684">Now we take this position because in accordance with the decisions in the Fifth Circuit and in the Seventh Circuit, with which we agree, we believe that if we were to, as the government argues, or my learned brother argues, extend the anti-fraud provisions of the 1933 Act to a pledge, an ordinary, garden variety pledge of stock as collateral for a loan to the terms sale in the 1933 Act or purchase in the 1934 Act, it would add a gloss to the operative language of the statute which, we submit, was not intended by Congress in view of the commonly accepted meaning of those words, sale and purchase.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="580.761" offset="2455506">Well Mr. Bender, do you concede, however, that the literal language of the definition of sale in the '33 Act is broad enough to embrace a pledge transaction?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_bender" startTime="592.735" stopTime="635.664">
            <label>Mr. Louis Bender</label>
            <text syncTime="592.735" offset="2503362">Mr. Justice Blackmun, I personally do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.722" offset="2523320">I do say, however, that the Courts of Appeal in the Fifth and the Seventh Circuits do say that the language is broad enough in the sense that it includes a disposition of an interest in the security as being broad enough to include a pledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.703" offset="2603255">And the reason why I don't, frankly, think so, is because I think that what a pledger does in... and what he did in this case... is simply to buy credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.194" offset="2657171">He doesn't sell anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.545" offset="2666576">And then the motion--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="635.664" stopTime="640.568">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="635.664" offset="2675144">What does the word disposition include other than sale, if you're right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_bender" startTime="640.568" stopTime="738.148">
            <label>Mr. Louis Bender</label>
            <text syncTime="640.568" offset="2694683">--The word disposition, under the Webster's Dictionary, is such a broad thing, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.638" offset="2719029">It even includes a donation, a giving.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.507" offset="2730419">And the point I'm trying to make is that you could say that the realities of the transaction is that a pledger says to a bank, I'm going to borrow half a million dollars from you and I'm going to put up security, I'm going to give you an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.434" offset="2798128">And that agreement is that in the event I default on this loan, you have an interest in my collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.805" offset="2835640">So that actually what I'm saying is that the most a pledger does is give an agreement that if there's a default the bank will acquire an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.597" offset="2878794">But there is not an effective in present disposition of an interest at the time the collateral agreement is entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.386" offset="2917978">In any event, even if we were to assume as my learned brother stresses that the literal definition of the statute, clearly embraces a pledge, it must be apparent that if Congress intended to include a pledge in the definition, it would have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.774" offset="3047545">It did so, but a year later, in 1935; that is two years later, in the Public Utility Holding Act, which I will come to--</text>

            <label>Justice Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="738.148" offset="3085057">Which is the... the Solicitor General seems to rest, pivot his case more on the word sale than on the word dispose.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.819" offset="3115673">I'll confess I'm a little puzzled by his willingness to do that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_bender" startTime="749.956" stopTime="851.505">
            <label>Mr. Louis Bender</label>
            <text syncTime="749.956" offset="3132287">--My learned brother also finds in the legislative history, a very distinct Congressional intention to include a pledge in the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.965" offset="3192264">I must confess that the Courts below, that are contrary to the Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit and the Seventh, find no such clear legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.190" offset="3241165">I must confess further that the legislative history as set forth is rather suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.344" offset="3269795">And the reason why I say that is because on November 10th, 1977, right before this Court, in the Bankers Trust Company against Mallis argument, that's number 76-1359 at page 45 of the transcript, I believe it was Mr. Justice Powell who asked the question,</text>
            <text syncTime="824.671" offset="3431127">"Is there anything in the legislative history of either Act of 1933 or 1934 that supports your position that a pledge is a sale? "</text>
            <text syncTime="835.728" offset="3475327">Mr. Pitt, who has been identified as general counsel of the SEC,</text>
            <text syncTime="840.680" offset="3495180">"If there is anything or something specific on pledges, I must confess I am not aware of that. "</text>
            <text syncTime="846.184" offset="3517122">Secondly--</text>

            <text syncTime="855.623" offset="3554948">No, it... it does not, Mr. Justice Stevens, and if that was the only area in which there might have been a difference, I would be hard put to say the legislative history is suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.854" offset="3627882">But I have an even more significant fact, and that is that the SEC conceded before this very Court on the same argument, that it had never taken a position that the Securities Act of 1933 or 1934 embraced in its definition a Congressional intent to include pledges.</text>

            <text syncTime="904.873" offset="3751911">Because in a civil case, if you've got a loan secured by stock you've got your liability established by the note.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.527" offset="3774585">So there's really no reason to fuss about it in a civil case, is there?</text>

            <text syncTime="915.947" offset="3796215">Well, except that the, in the government's position... I mean, since these cases all come up, for example, Gentile, in the Court of Appeals, was on a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.469" offset="3838324">But all the other cases are civil cases.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Bender</label>
            <text syncTime="929.671" offset="3851072">There are civil cases under 17(a)(1), and civil cases where, under 10(b)(5).</text>
            <text syncTime="938.194" offset="3885240">And for example, the... I believe, so that actually, to answer your question, although the government, or my learned brother would like to separate this issue by saying that this is a criminal case it should not and will not affect what may happen as far as civil actions are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.479" offset="4014389">The fact remains that the Securities Exchange Commission's general counsel and so did the Court of Appeals in the Second Circuit indicate that the same rule that would apply in the criminal case, at least with respect to whether a pledge of collateral for a loan is a sale, would apply in any civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.613" offset="4118879">And the courts seem generally to take that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.767" offset="4135493">And of course, the general counsel of the SEC told this Court the last time that you also can't separate the 1933 Act definitions from the 1934, even though there's a slight difference in the wording.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.877" offset="4199963">Because the statutes are entire materia, they said, so that what you hold with regard to the definition of a sale under the 1933 Act applies under the 1934 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.037" offset="4256597">When Congress wanted to say that a pledge was a sale, it had no trouble saying so; and it did so in the Public Utility Holding Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1120.944" offset="4616251">So I suppose that goes further than an actual physical delivery, right there, when you're talking about a contract of sale, would include an agreement to transfer possession in 60 days or disposition... now that, wouldn't that include any agreement to transfer by pledge, if disposition is such a broad gauge term, as you have suggested?</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Bender</label>
            <text syncTime="1153.732" offset="4747385">--Well as I said before, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the Fifth and the Seventh Circuits seem to agree that it's broad enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.136" offset="4781031">That the language itself is broad enough to include a pledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.290" offset="4801616">What I... what they say, however, is that the economic underlying realities of a pledge indicate that it's so far from what a sale or a purchase really was intended by Congress, that the literal interpretation should not be followed in the sense of reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.719" offset="4883327">And the reason for that is set forth in the totally different kind of rights that exist as between a pledge and as between an actual sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.377" offset="4933900">And the fact remains that for 25 years, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the administrative agency who sat with the Congress at the time that this act was enacted, never took a public position that a pledge was included.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.475" offset="5026373">It was only until the late 1950's that they conceded that they did; and it's interesting, because Professor Loss points out that it was only when the Guild Films decision in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on which the Second Circuit's Gentile decision relies came down did the Securities and Exchange Commission adopt the decision to its corporate bosom and take the position that a pledge was included as a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.902" offset="5200035">Now my learned brother makes no mention in his brief as to why, if the legislative history intended to include a pledge even though it didn't say so, why the Securities and Exchange Commission never took that position publicly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.899" offset="5280074">And this Court had occasion to remark about the divergent views of the Securities and Exchange Commission in the International Brotherhood case, dealing with the includability of the noncontributory pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.027" offset="5352590">I believe Mr. Justice Powell, speaking for the Court, said</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.164" offset="5369100">"when the instant litigation arose, the public record reveals no evidence that the SEC had ever considered the Securities Acts applicable to a non-contributory pension. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.674" offset="5431167">Similarly here, the SEC never took the position that pledges were included in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.398" offset="5474007">And as I say, the Public Utility Holding Act, in 1935, clearly includes pledge in its definition of a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.806" offset="5531686">Now my learned brother says that we shouldn't look to what Congress did in 1935 to determine what it did or intended to do in 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.299" offset="5585602">This Court, we submit, had no trouble in doing just that very thing, even where a greater span existed between the 1933 and 1934 Acts in the International Brotherhood case against Daniel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.010" offset="5660522">Now my learned brother says that Congress intended to protect banks, corporate businesses, lenders... even if the bank was not an investor in this particular instance and of course the bank, really, if you look at the underlying transactions, was not an investor.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="1936.383" offset="7878004">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.560" offset="7930667">The government contends that Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 prohibits fraudulent pledges of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.249" offset="7965462">In making this contention, we rely on the literal terms of the statute, the ordinary meaning of those terms in 1933 and the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.954" offset="8008303">I'd like to take up each of these points in turn with a concluding reference to Petitioner's policy arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.043" offset="8036620">Section 17(a) forbids fraudulent or deceptive practices of any kind in the offer or sale of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.697" offset="8067235">Petitioner doesn't deny that he and his co-conspirators pledged securities with the bank or that they deliberately made misrepresentations about the value, marketability and ownership of those securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.707" offset="8119271">Instead he contends that pledge transactions should not be deemed to be offers or sales within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.544" offset="8150618">In our submission the literal terms of the Securities Act leave no room to doubt that the Petitioner both offered and sold securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.050" offset="8184682">Under the statute, the word sale is not limited to a common law sale in which title or fee simple ownership is transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.406" offset="8218014">It expressly includes every, and I emphasize the word every, disposition of an interest in a security for value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.143" offset="8253018">The word offer is defined by Congress in equally expansive terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.147" offset="8272976">The word offer includes every attempt to dispose of an interest in a security for value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.718" offset="8299307">Petitioner and his co-conspirators offered and sold securities because they attempted to and did convey a legal interest in those securities to the bank-pledgee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.775" offset="8343506">The bank stipulated that it would not part with its money without obtaining that legal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.079" offset="8364718">The interest of course was the pledgee's legal right to possess the securities and to sell them in the event of a default for its own benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.685" offset="8399199">That legal interest which Petitioner correctly describes in his brief as a security interest was formalized by stock powers and powers of attorney which gave the bank the right to sell those securities if necessary to satisfy its economic claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.045" offset="8464610">If Congress had meant to exclude this well-recognized legal interest of a pledgee from the definition of offer and sale, it surely would not have used the language that it did in the Securities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.470" offset="8522288">It would be a remarkable example of legislative inattention if Congress wrote this statute to extend to every disposition of an interest in a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.945" offset="8564189">If it really had meant to say every disposition of an interest except for a pledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.249" offset="8585400">The dictionary meaning of the word interest, which Congress used without qualification, is the legally enforceable right to have an advantage accruing from some thing, or any right in the nature of property but less than title.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.358" offset="8645900">It was settled law in 1933 that a pledgee obtained just such a legal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.912" offset="8672127">Decisions of this Court and the learned treatises of the time, confirmed that a pledgee received a special property interest in pledged securities and that it gave value for that special property interest when it extended credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.939" offset="8732208">Indeed, by 1933, it was a black letter principle of commercial law that a pledgee that received negotiable securities without notice of adverse claims, enjoyed the status of a bona fide purchaser for value, whose legal interest was superior to that of third parties, claiming prior ownership rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.102" offset="8816845">In short, looking to the ordinary meaning of the terms used by Congress when the Securities Act was enacted, it's clear that the Petitioner's pledge of securities was a disposition of an interest in those securities for value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.945" offset="8876195">I might add in this connection that although Mr. Bender has addressed the question in this case with great competence, I have yet to hear him explain to the Court what it was that the bank got, if it wasn't a legal interest in these pledged securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.788" offset="8931575">Petitioner of course also argues that the Court should not apply the statute literally, as Congress has written it, because the legislative history doesn't refer to pledge transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.662" offset="8979118">That omission however, is not sufficing, because the legislative history doesn't describe any of the interests that Congress meant to embrace within its definition of offer and sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.785" offset="9019555">Congress took care of the problem of specifying which transactions it meant to cover, by drafting the statute to apply to every disposition of an interest in a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.843" offset="9067829">And even more fundamentally, omissions from the legislative history can't nullify the plain meaning of the statute as this Court pointed out, last term, in Harrison v. P.P.G. Industries, where the Court stated and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.352" offset="9125821">"it would be a strange cannon of statutory construction that would require Congress to state in committee reports or elsewhere, that which is obvious on the face of the statute. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.143" offset="9168976">I don't mean to suggest from these remarks that the legislative history doesn't shed light on the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.397" offset="9198024">It does shed substantial light and confirms the appropriateness of the literal statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.967" offset="9224355">In the first place--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="2274.903" offset="9232087">Well if we have a literal statutory construction available, why do we look at legislative history?</text>

            <text syncTime="2282.489" offset="9262389">--It's completely unnecessary, Your Honor, if... unless the legislative history were to completely conflict with the plain meaning, the legislative history is merely icing on the cake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.797" offset="9303663">And we offer it in that spirit, because the literal terms of this statute do prohibit fraud in the pledge of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.868" offset="9331875">But just to assure the Court that there is no disharmony in the legislative history in the plain text, I'll refer briefly to the antecedents of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.640" offset="9366984">This history shows that Congress intended its definitions of offer and sale to be broad and expansive definitions, as this Court recently emphasized in United States against Naftalin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.149" offset="9421005">For this reason, the statutory definitions which reach every disposition or attempt to dispose of an interest in a security for value, should not be given an interpretation which narrows the broad language deliberately selected by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.226" offset="9481296">In the second place, the legislative history shows that Congress based its definitional language on the language used in the Uniform Sale of Securities Act of 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.201" offset="9525286">The literal terms of that Uniform Act apply to pledge transactions and the language was so construed by the Ninth Circuit, one year before Congress incorporated that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.157" offset="9569067">This re-inforces the ordinary presumption that Congress intended that the language that it used would be given a literal statutory construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2505.482" offset="10154314">Certainly the Commission never interpreted the statute differently than it is now interpreting it; it's been a consistent interpretation ever since this issue first came up in litigation in '58.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.654" offset="10195065">Because the language that Congress has used is unambiguous and is not at odds with the legislative history, it's unnecessary to dwell at any length on the contentions of policy or statutory purpose that Petitioner has presented in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.383" offset="10266014">But I wouldn't want to leave the impression that those contentions are supportive of his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.954" offset="10284300">To the extent that policy is relevant here, it supports the government's interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.508" offset="10302481">Petitioner, of course, argues that Section 17(a) should protect investors only, and not defrauded banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.077" offset="10332783">That's the very line of argument that this Court rejected in United States against Naftalin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.731" offset="10355353">In Naftalin, the defendant defrauded several brokerage houses which served as financial intermediaries; they weren't investors, they didn't purchase securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.004" offset="10392447">This Court, nonetheless, applied the statute literally, concluding that it forbids all fraudulent devices and transactions that meet the statutory definition of offer or sale, regardless of the identity of the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.745" offset="10443438">The statute protects honest businesses, as well as investors, as this Court held unequivocally in Naftalin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.767" offset="10475516">Petitioner also argues that the bank here assumed a commercial risk rather than an investment risk, and therefore his fraud should be immune to punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.690" offset="10511147">But there is nothing in the statute which suggests that the nature of the risk assumed by the victim of the fraud has any relevance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.462" offset="10542285">I need hardly point out, moreover, that Congress has not defined these terms investment risk and commercial risk, which Petitioner relies on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.902" offset="10576035">It would therefore be most inappropriate to construe a criminal statute such as Section 17(a) by reference to these undefined concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.758" offset="10615428">Congress has drafted the statute without ambiguities, to apply to every disposition of an interest in a security for value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.779" offset="10647506">It makes no difference that that disposition occurs in a commercial or a business environment, or that involves a risk that might be characterized as having commercial attributes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.254" offset="10693482">I should point out, also, in this connection that although Petitioner asks the Court to look to the economic realities of the transactions in which he engaged, the reality of those transactions was that the bank gave value and acquired an interest in several hundred thousand shares of stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.216" offset="10765266">The bank attempted to obtain the same kind of high quality investment range securities that an investor might select.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.787" offset="10795568">And the fraud practiced on the bank deceived it, into believing that it was obtaining valuable securities traded on the public securities markets--</text>
