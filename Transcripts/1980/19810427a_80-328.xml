            <text syncTime="71.529" offset="461527">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="74.898" offset="475006">This case involves the legality of a search conducted by a police officer of a jacket belonging to the respondent and the admissibility of the evidence... in this case, cocaine... which was obtained from that jacket.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.641" offset="533938">The basic issue boils down essentially to whether or not the search was permissible as a search incident to a lawful arrest which was one of the several well-recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.483" offset="597364">By way, just very briefly, of background of the case and how it got here.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.637" offset="613978">The respondent moved to suppress the cocaine at the trial level; that motion was denied after a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.875" offset="646892">The evidence was held admissible; the respondent subsequently pled guilty and appealed the case to the New York State intermediate appellate court, which unanimously held that the search was proper of the jacket in this case, as a search incident to a lawful arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.889" offset="726931">The respondent further appealed to the New York Court of Appeals which in a divided opinion reversed the appellate court, lower appellate court, and held that the officer had in effect reduced the jacket to his exclusive control when he, if you will, picked it up, and therefore a warrant was at that time necessary under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.356" offset="828809">The facts in this case, if I could very briefly run through them... I think they're very important, and they're pretty much... well, they're not in dispute by either counsel for the respondent or myself, but I'd like to go through, and start out by saying that it was on April ninth 1978, that the Trooper Nicot in this case, a state policeman, was patrolling the New York State Thruway, an interstate highway, and he spotted the respondent's vehicle traveling at a high rate of speed on the highway.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.445" offset="969138">There were four male occupants, two in the back and two in the front.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.845" offset="978752">When he went up to the window... it was rolled down by the driver; he went to the driver's side... he smelled fresh burning marijuana and observed on the floor a Supergold stamped container which he knew from his training to be a container that normally contains marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.226" offset="1064329">At that point in time he directed all four occupants to leave the vehicle, which was a two-door vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.082" offset="1099751">They got out of the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.868" offset="1110827">He at that point in time retrieved the Supergold container, which did contain marijuana, in fact, and some four or five "roaches" or burned marijuana cigarettes in the ashtray of the front portion of the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.961" offset="1175192">At that point in time he again patted down or searched further all of the four occupants of the vehicle, read them their Miranda rights, placed them under arrest for possession of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.653" offset="1237991">At this time we had four defendants outside of the motor vehicle there on the expressway.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.474" offset="1261292">The officer then went back into the vehicle and on the back seat there were lying five jackets.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.913" offset="1299013">He picked up the jacket involved in this particular case and he took ahold of it, went through it, and found cocaine in an unzipped pocket as well as a $20 bill and cocaine in a zippered pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.541" offset="1369543">Not that that makes any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.976" offset="1375290">And he then asked each of the four defendants, at this point, occupants of that vehicle, as to who owned this particular jacket.</text>

            <text syncTime="1614.841" offset="6634784">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.591" offset="6645756">Respondent has asserted in his brief that we wholly disagree with the arguments of the state, and I just wanted to begin by making the point that we do not disagree with the state in its arguments that this was within the Chimel scope, focusing on the facts of the case and the reasonableness of the officer's actions under the particular facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.824" offset="6746693">We think that, however, that that kind of inquiry which is amply... the state's position is amply supported, if it be made in this case, is not an inquiry that needs to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.168" offset="6808028">Our argument addresses, then, the question of whether a valid search incident to an arrest can be justified solely by reference to the spatial limitations; that is, whether it comes within the Chimel scope, and the temporal limitations during the arrest process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.866" offset="6894859">We were concerned about the exclusive control notion which both the New York Court of Appeals in this case and the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals in the Benson case, in which we have a cert petition pending, have imported from Chadwick, where I think it had quite a different meaning and intention, into this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.197" offset="6984198">Our argument in this case, contrary to what respondent has suggested in his brief, is not intended to undermine either thoroughly, as he says, or in any way, Chimel, or Chadwick, or Sanders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.890" offset="7046892">It doesn't call the validity of those decisions into question at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.110" offset="7063819">The permissible scope of the search of the person of an arrestee incident to arrest has been settled in Robinson and that scope is broad indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.168" offset="7112094">This case concerns the aspect of a search incident doctrine involving a search of containers or items of some kind that are nearby but not on the person or being worn by the arrested individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.630" offset="7181893">And our position is that such nearby items like the items on the person should be subject to the same test for a valid search incident to arrest as long as the search is made during the period of the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.655" offset="7246050">We would not contend, with respect to a separate container that may have been seized, that the Edwards principle that a search incident to arrest can occur later, would be applicable to such containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.249" offset="7304355">Now, the first question in analyzing the case is whether, when the officer went and seized respondent's jacket, the jacket was at that time within the spatial area defined by this Court's opinion in Chimel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2028.659" offset="8290007">But the decision of the court of appeals here and of the 8th Circuit in our Benson case seems to go beyond that and suggests that even though an item is seized from within the Chimel area, there is a separate inquiry whether at the time it is searched it is within the exclusive control of the officer searching it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.060" offset="8391571">And that test, which as far as I know, is novel to our jurisprudence prior to Chadwick, comes from certain language that was used in Chadwick, and I think in a quite different context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.652" offset="8453952">There are several difficulties that we perceive with the exclusive control notion that has been used by the lower court in several of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.810" offset="8494598">First, I would make the point that it runs afoul of the holding in Adams v. Williams, which was a case where, according to the record that was the appendix in this Court, Williams had been arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.618" offset="8549873">The officer then waited until additional officers arrived on the scene, at which point the car was searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.874" offset="8574846">Now, it was not a subject of analysis in the Court's opinion, but the Court did uphold the search of the car and the seizures of the heroin found in the car as incident to William's arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.396" offset="8616956">The same is true in Draper where, I assume, at the time the zipper bag was searched it was within the exclusive control of the officer in this sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.287" offset="8664498">And the problem with the exclusive control test, the way it's being used, is that it essentially eliminates searches of any item that is capable of being picked up and carried away by the officer as incident to arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2287.891" offset="9326964">But the point in Chadwick was that the Court was merely referring to settled doctrine which had been settled in Preston, that a search subsequent to, some hours later, after the arrest has been completed, is no longer incident to the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.401" offset="9384956">It was not at all talking about a situation of a search contemporaneous with the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.304" offset="9404600">Indeed, the exclusive control argument seems to me totally inconsistent with Robinson, because in Robinson, as Justice Marshall pointed out in his dissent, at the time the cigarette pack was searched it was in the control of the officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.247" offset="9468338">The officer could have taken it and put it away somewhere out of the reach of the arrested individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.735" offset="9490281">Therefore it seems to me that once the Court has rejected that with respect to items removed from the person of the individual, there is precious little logical basis for treating it differently if the item is found nearby.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.411" offset="9552975">Earlier, during my brother's argument, the question came up about whether he had been wearing a jacket, carrying a jacket, had it down on the park bench, or so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.218" offset="9596234">Of course, once, if the jacket is removed from his person and the officer is holding it and he starts looking through its pockets, he has exclusive control in the sense that the lower courts were talking about.</text>

            <text syncTime="2450.761" offset="9978458">That argument is either wholly irrelevant or at least not very significant when we are talking about a search incident to arrest, because the search incident to arrest is not justified by probable cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2467.555" offset="10045645">I think the Court made the point in a footnote in Chadwick that when you are dealing with a type of search like an inventory search, which is not justified by probable cause, cases dealing with the warrant requirement are not really opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.882" offset="10102905">The argument is particularly inappropriate, it seems to me, when you're dealing with a jacket, because a jacket is, of course, the very kind of thing that is most likely to be subject to a search incident to arrest, since a person will usually be wearing it or carrying it at the time of arrest.</text>
