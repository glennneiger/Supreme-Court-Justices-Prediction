            <text syncTime="42.734" offset="312969">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="46.544" offset="328224">Petitioners in this case are truck drivers employed by Respondent, Arkansas-Best Freight System.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.386" offset="351630">They operate out of ABF's Little Rock, Arkansas, terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.915" offset="369707">They are required prior to embarking on an over-the-road trip to conduct a rigorous pre-trip safety inspection of their vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.881" offset="409622">Among other things they must check all of the safety devices, the brakes, coupling devices, and so forth, to make sure they are in good working order.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.518" offset="444104">Generally it takes the drivers approximately 15 minutes to half an hour to conduct this inspection, and when defects are found to take the vehicle to ABF's repair facility, which is located at the terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.496" offset="500110">ABF refuses to compensate the drivers for this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.838" offset="521426">Accordingly, the drivers have filed a series of grievances alleging that ABF's refusal violates the terms of their contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.022" offset="554131">These grievances, in turn, were processed by the union, which processed them through the joint grievance committee procedures spelled out in the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.049" offset="598226">Despite the fact that the lower courts have found that applying a literal reading of the collective bargaining agreement this time would be compensable, the joint grievance committees rejected the drivers' grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.433" offset="655800">Accordingly, with no further remedy left under the contract, petitioners filed suit in March, 1977, alleging--</text>

            <text syncTime="142.880" offset="713583">Petitioners... the grievances had been pursued through final stage of the grievance procedure set forth in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.034" offset="746184">Accordingly, petitioners filed suit in district court, alleging among other things that ABF's refusal to compensate them for this time violated the minimum wage provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. David C. Vladeck</label>
            <text syncTime="170.619" offset="824551">Yes, Your Honor, there was an allegation that it did.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="173.446" offset="835836">But that isn't what this case is about?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_c_vladeck" startTime="175.679" stopTime="252.367">
            <label>Mr. David C. Vladeck</label>
            <text syncTime="175.679" offset="844822">Well, we have not pressed that issue here, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.570" offset="852345">Despite the fact that defendants have pressed the Fair Labor Standards Act issue, however, neither court below reached the merit of that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.925" offset="889752">Rather, both courts held instead that the prior submission of their contract-based grievance claim to arbitration barred the right to have court review of their statutory claim under the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.934" offset="949834">Accordingly, the sole question presented here is whether submission of their contract claim to the joint grievance committee barred subsequent court review of their claim under the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.648" offset="1004691">Petitioners submit that the courthouse door must remain open to review the merits of their statutory claims, regardless of whether there has been a prior arbitrator award and that the resolution of the issue presented here is controlled by two principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.845" offset="1077416">The first principle that I will discuss is that the decision below was inconsistent with the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.121" offset="1110539">This Court in a series of decisions has held that rights conferred under the Fair Labor Standards Act cannot be waived or bargained away as part of the collective bargaining process.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="252.367" stopTime="259.646">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="252.367" offset="1151499">Then you necessarily mean that an agreement to arbitrate is bargaining away those rights?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_c_vladeck" startTime="259.646" stopTime="278.577">
            <label>Mr. David C. Vladeck</label>
            <text syncTime="259.646" offset="1180652">No, Your Honor, what my contention here is, is that this contract as construed by the joint grievance committees violates the Fair Labor Standards Act, and what petitioners want is the right to go into court to litigate that question under the statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="278.577" stopTime="308.846">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="278.577" offset="1256407">And your contention would be not that the arbitrator had applied an improper reading of the contract but that even if the contract had expressly said that this is the wages we will be paid and we will not be paid for the time you claim, the federal law simply prohibits that kind of contract?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_c_vladeck" startTime="308.846" stopTime="320.372">
            <label>Mr. David C. Vladeck</label>
            <text syncTime="308.846" offset="1377511">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.001" offset="1382108">The second point that I will turn to later on is that the decision below cannot be reconciled with this Court's decision in the Gardner-Denver decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="323.605" offset="1436548">Gardner-Denver was a Title VII case, Your Honor.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="325.745" offset="1445011">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.573" offset="1448355">This is not a Title VII case, is it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_c_vladeck" startTime="328.620" stopTime="492.662">
            <label>Mr. David C. Vladeck</label>
            <text syncTime="328.620" offset="1456505">That's correct, Your Honor, but petitioners' position is that the standard of nonpreclusion of court review of federally granted rights should govern in this case, and as I will argue later, the statutes are parallel in all material respects and those parallels demonstrate that Gardner-Denver should govern in this case as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.295" offset="1567264">But let me first turn to my argument under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.732" offset="1580952">The Fair Labor Standards Act is a broadly remedial statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.433" offset="1595790">It embodies a number of distinct and diverse policy judgments made by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.260" offset="1619091">Among other things the Act sets forth a strict policy of guaranteed minimum wage compensation for all workers covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.038" offset="1658275">In addition, it grants certain workers the right to premium pay for overtime work.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.206" offset="1682935">To insure effective enforcement of the statute, Congress has authorized courts to impose a variety of remedies, including double damages, attorneys' fees, injunctive relief, back pay awards in cases where the employee prevails.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.603" offset="1764437">The role of these provisions is dual.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.102" offset="1782513">Congress used them to both determine employer violations and to insure that workers who had been injured by Fair Labor Standards Act violations were fully compensated for their injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.457" offset="1827862">Because of the remedial nature of the statute, this Court has often recognized that rights conferred by the Fair Labor Standards Act can neither be waived nor bargained away during the course of the collective bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.356" offset="1891496">Indeed, this Court has expressly held that any customer contract that falls short of these policies... for example, an agreement to pay less than minimum wages... cannot be used to deprive workers of their statutory rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.522" offset="1956175">Nonetheless, in the face of these decisions, the court below's decision effectively insulates from judicial scrutiny the contract which we contend does precisely that: cuts back on petitioners' right to certain minimum wage compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.095" offset="2022422">Under the lower court's theory, arbitration, which is, at this Court has recognized, an extension of the collective bargaining process, can be used to foreclose employees' right to sue under the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.211" offset="2082921">And petitioners submit that this result simply cannot be reconciled with this Court's prior decisions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="492.662" stopTime="504.470">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="492.662" offset="2112701">Well, we have held, haven't we, in a recent case that a collective bargaining contract could override the Norris-La Guardia Act?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_c_vladeck" startTime="504.470" stopTime="507.813">
            <label>Mr. David C. Vladeck</label>

            <label>Mr. David C. Vladeck</label>
            <text syncTime="511.545" offset="2188247">Well, Your Honor, we're talking here about statutory rights that are conferred on an individual worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.917" offset="2217713">These are not the majoritarian rights that are derived from a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.181" offset="2234850">And our position is that where rights are expressly conferred by Congress and Congress has provided that the courts should enforce those rights, an arbitration decision or a collective bargaining agreement cannot cut back on those statutory rights.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="542.673" stopTime="568.913">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="542.673" offset="2312799">But under the Norris-La Guardia Act, there were stringent restrictions placed on injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.218" offset="2342997">Injunctions run against individuals as well as unions, and yet in some of our later cases we said that those stringent restrictions could be altered by the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_c_vladeck" startTime="568.913" stopTime="626.234">
            <label>Mr. David C. Vladeck</label>
            <text syncTime="568.913" offset="2417707">I am aware of no decision of this Court which supports the proposition that an arbitration award or a contract can cut back on an employee's rights that have been both conferred directly by statute and are enforceable by that statute through the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.250" offset="2487088">And that is this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.827" offset="2497432">The point that I'm trying to make is that unless the Fair Labor Standards Act claim can be brought into court after an arbitration award, then the Act affords employees nothing more than they would derive from the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.973" offset="2590010">In a sense the lower court decision renders the Fair Labor Standards Act a nullity insofar as it applies to workers who are covered by collective bargaining agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="703.813" offset="2957292">Nonetheless, this Court unanimously held that a prior arbitration decision, even under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement that were precisely identical to the statute, did not relieve the federal courts from their duty to examine the statutory claim on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.680" offset="3028763">So, I guess in a longwinded sense, my answer to your question is that even if the contract had borrowed precisely from the language of the Fair Labor Standards Act, courts would nonetheless be required to review the merits of that decision, to review the merits of the statutory claim, to make sure that the rights had not been impaired.</text>

            <text syncTime="757.276" offset="3171183">Well, in some respects, Your Honor, I think it's an easier case.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.258" offset="3183095">Why don't I talk about that first?</text>
            <text syncTime="763.570" offset="3196365">It's an easier case because unlike Gardner-Denver, where Congress had set up an elaborate mechanism of dispute resolution prior to court review, elaborate exhaustion requirements, deferrals to state agencies, as this Court elaborated in the Mohasco decision last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.857" offset="3285495">There is nothing in the Fair Labor Standards Act which bars immediate employee access to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.135" offset="3318618">Now, getting back to the thrust of your question, I think that that was one of the reasons the lower court ruled against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.599" offset="3364489">That is, that they distinguished between the nature of employee wage claims and claims of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.954" offset="3401896">I think there are several answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.281" offset="3415166">In the first place, the decision that wage claims are somehow simpler or less complex than claims of discrimination is inherently a difficult one.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.322" offset="3475352">I doubt strongly that this Court wants to weigh the relative complexity of various federal statutes in deciding how vigorous the Court should be in enforcing a Congress command.</text>

            <text syncTime="876.460" offset="3647865">All that... my point is that... to begin with, apart from the inherent difficulty in measuring the relative complexities of various statutes, this Court... it is a doubtful proposition that this Court wants to waive the relative importance of various remedial statutory schemes passed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.155" offset="3734696">But even assuming that that's relevant, that it's a relevant inquiry, here the long history of the Fair Labor Standards Act and several of this Court's opinions recognizing its vital policy underpinnings, strongly support petitioners' contention that it merits equally vigilant court enforcement as Title VII or any other remedial humanitarian protection of statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="940.233" offset="3903029">Under the lower court's theory, as I read it, and I'm not sure it is without ambiguity, employees would have the option of either first going into court or using the collective bargaining procedure spelled out in their contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.740" offset="3973037">If they opt for arbitration under the lower court's theory, they are barred from going into court thereafter, and an employee who is faced with waiving forever his right to liquidated damages, attorneys' fees, back pay, the host of remedies that could be imposed under the Fair Labor Standards Act, as well as the superior procedural rights afforded in court review, may well opt to go into court rather than to choose for arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.273" offset="4115144">It may well be that the most efficient answer that this Court can provide is the same one it did in Gardner-Denver, and that is to hold that regardless of whether the workers first employ the arbitration process, they retain the right to go into court but preserving the option of arbitration, which is relatively cheap and relatively quick.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.498" offset="4228097">It may well be, as this Court observed in Gardner-Denver, employees will opt first to arbitrate their grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.618" offset="4256518">It may well be in a large number of cases that whatever remedies they're entitled to under the contract will be adequate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1256.823" offset="5169341">I'd like to turn for a moment to one of the arguments raised by the court below in rejecting application of Gardner-Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.599" offset="5224512">The principal reason was, as I think Mr. Justice White suggested, that wage claims are somehow less complex, or somehow less deserving of protection by the courts than discrimination claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.358" offset="5291490">And I think the fundamental problem with that approach is that it rests on a misapprehension of the nature and scope of the arbitrable process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.712" offset="5340913">To begin with, arbitrators have no general authority to apply the dictates of public law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.100" offset="5366513">Rather, this Court has made it clear in a number of decisions that an arbitration award will be only enforced, only so long as it draws its essence from the contract between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.173" offset="5410817">Moreover, the arbitrator would not have the right to impose the broad range of remedies Congress thought necessary to root out violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.888" offset="5457628">The third reason is that the arbitration process is not necessarily adequate procedurally to protect statutory claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.743" offset="5497021">Let me give you an example here, where we're dealing not with conventional arbitration but with a joint grievance committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.663" offset="5520740">There was no neutral arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.834" offset="5529413">Although there are many grievances filed, there is no written decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.316" offset="5547385">Petitioners do not even have a right to have counsel present during the grievance hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.610" offset="5572567">So there is no parallel between the remedies and procedural safeguards that are afforded under this procedure and in general under arbitration, as there are in court procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.042" offset="5630246">And lastly, the finality that is normally given to arbitration award rests in part on the fact that arbitrators are simply proctors of the bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.022" offset="5678206">They are simply trying to derive what it was that the parties privately bargaining for a contract decided to agree upon.</text>

            <text syncTime="1610.525" offset="6584133">The purpose for the Fair Labor Standards Act was to protect the unorganized worker and it was not to protect organized labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.456" offset="6623944">This purpose is implicit in the legislative history of the Act and was exemplified in the exchange in the Senate between Mr. Walsh and Mr. Black in which the question was asked, if upon the adoption of the FLSA it would have any effect on existing or on future collective bargaining agreements?</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.791" offset="6729269">And the negative response was given.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1649.275" offset="6739196">Wasn't there a proposal somewhere along the line in the debate of this pending bill to make the Fair Labor Standards Act applicable only to unorganized workers, and wasn't that proposal rejected?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="s_walton_maurras" startTime="1668.031" stopTime="1981.593">
            <label>Mr. S. Walton Maurras</label>
            <text syncTime="1668.031" offset="6814219">It was, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.141" offset="6818608">However, nothing... To the contrary, the statute was left silent as to whether it was exclusive for unorganized labor or included both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.105" offset="6866464">It did not thereafter go and specifically address the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.167" offset="6882765">This Court, subsequent to the adoption of the Act in the Brooklyn Savings Bank case, acknowledged the fact that the purpose for the Act was to protect the unorganized worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.238" offset="6931039">And although subsequent to the Brooklyn Savings Bank Case this Court decided in Jewel Ridge and in the Anderson v. Mt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.233" offset="6982970">Clemens case that acts which had not previously been determined to be work or compensable under the collective bargaining agreements were compensable under the FLSA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.087" offset="7042425">Congress responded to the decisions of the Court by adopting the Portal-to-Portal Pay Act, and in so doing stated in its findings and purposes that it was necessary to adopt that Act because of judicial interpretation that were in disregard of the customs, practices, and contracts between employers and employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.076" offset="7150363">Again, the Court, subsequent to the Portal-to-Portal Act, decided the case of Bay Ridge in which the Court stated that the FLSA required that certain activity be treated as overtime which had not been treated as overtime in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.550" offset="7252241">The result of the decision was to have the payment of FLSA overtime on top of contractual overtime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.671" offset="7288812">Congress again responded to that decision of the Court with the Overtime-on-Overtime Act, and in its statement of findings for the necessity of the Act said that the claims which had resulted from the Court's decision were windfalls and were in derogation of the collective bargaining agreements as they were understood by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.052" offset="7378255">Congress also said that the arrangements for the overtime was the result of collective bargaining, and that there was no evidence that it was other than at arm's length.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.455" offset="7423917">So I would submit to the Court that because of the subsequent actions of Congress in trying to restrict the decisions so that the FLSA did not take precedence over legitimate bona fide collective bargaining agreements, evidences the intent of Congress to protect the unorganized worker as opposed to organized labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.037" offset="7534259">The FLSA itself does not require that the action for its enforcement be judicial in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.706" offset="7576890">Section 216(b) says that an action for damages for back wages or for liquidated damages may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.168" offset="7630703">It does not use the mandatory "shall".</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.511" offset="7644077">There is no language in the statute that prohibits alternate forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.023" offset="7674170">If Congress had wanted to prohibit alternate forms, it certainly could have done so, as it did in the Securities Act, and said that you cannot... specifically... cannot waive any of the rights accorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.534" offset="7732162">In Donahue v. Susquehanna Collieries, that court acknowledged this idea that if Congress had wanted to exclude arbitration as a method of resolving FLSA claims, that Congress could have specifically so stated in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.306" offset="7815336">Now, the petitioners have stated in their reply brief that Donahue is clouded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.319" offset="7843339">Then I would submit to you that that cloud is more apparent than real.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.146" offset="7862670">The cases the petitioners cite as creating a cloud in fact state that the Arbitration Act cannot be used to enforce employment contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.062" offset="7918363">They do not go beyond that holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.263" offset="7927140">There is nothing in the holdings which says that FLSA claims cannot be arbitrated if the parties voluntarily agree to it in the context of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.773" offset="7989207">And as a matter of fact, in one of the petitioners' cases, the Colonial Hardwood Flooring case, that court says, that while they hold that the Arbitration Act is not applicable, that is not to say that the parties may not voluntarily agree to arbitrate their disputes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2192.882" offset="8913628">Article 44 in this contract says that any controversy which may arise is subject to the arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.597" offset="8944453">It's not limited to controversies arising under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.158" offset="8958664">Article 43 also provides that any grievance of any employee will be processed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2292.514" offset="9312152">But before you get to that question, you first have to determine, are the acts that the employees performed work?</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.635" offset="9356665">Now, to do that you have to go to the Muscoda test and determine whether or not this inspection meets the Muscoda requirements.</text>

            <text syncTime="3351.289" offset="13547228">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.272" offset="13555170">I'd just like to respond briefly to Justice Stevens' question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.895" offset="13573664">Whether this time is compensable under the Fair Labor Standards Act or not turns on the question under the statute of whether it is integral or indispensable to the primary activity of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.062" offset="13626327">That phrase has been the subject of nearly 40 years of judicial construction, a host of Department of Labor regulations, case law, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.557" offset="13684319">It is a statutory question, one that is typically resolved by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.024" offset="13702187">I do not... it is not akin to the question that was put before the arbitrator in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.598" offset="13728518">The second point that I'd like to address is the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.175" offset="13742729">Congress has never suggested in its various deliberations on the Fair Labor Standards Act that a contract providing below the minimum standards set forth in the Act could be used to cut back on those minimum standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.762" offset="13801139">It has considered the applicability of collective bargaining agreements many times, and it's never yet, never reached that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.792" offset="13833217">The last point I would like to make is that counsel for respondent has somehow equated the duty of fair representation standard with one about the correct interpretation of a contract, and that standard be somehow engrafted upon a Fair Labor Standards Act litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.563" offset="13920361">There are two separate standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.469" offset="13927989">Congress has provided distinct statutory rights, rights that are not merged into the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.106" offset="13958500">Neither Congress nor this Court has ever even suggested that a court must accept an arbitrator's resolution of a contract claim as dispositive of an independent claim under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.538" offset="14012208">To the contrary, the decisions of this Court including the decision in Gardner-Denver suggested the opposite, that while contract rights are properly relegated to the arbitral forum the courthouse door must stay open to resolve statutory claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.813" offset="14081380">And I think this case bears out the wisdom of that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.061" offset="14094337">Because unless petitioners can get into court, there is no way that they can challenge this pay practice as being violative of their rights under the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
