            <text syncTime="251.406" offset="1138884">Ms. Burdine was hired by the Texas Department of Community Affairs in January of 1972 as an accounting clerk and was quickly promoted to a coordinating role in the division, in the public service careers division, with some supervisory responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.320" offset="1218505">She worked under a fellow by the name of Mr. Mark Nealy, who was the project director of the public service careers division.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.359" offset="1254658">Nealy quit in October of 1972 and was not replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.913" offset="1276915">And during the ensuing year from January of '72 when Ms. Burdine was hired until the following April of '73, when she was fired, there developed a certain amount of dissension among Ms. Burdine and two other employees in the division, Mr. Roberto Carraveo and Marian Kirkland.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.647" offset="1379837">The public service careers division was wholly funded by the United States Department of Labor and in February of 1973, the Department notified the executive director of the Texas Department of Community Affairs, Mr. B. R. Fuller, that funding for the program would cease due to inefficiencies in its administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.246" offset="1474192">And they specifically noted that there was a failure of fiscal controls in the division, that there had been improper documentation of expenditures, overstaffing and questionable eligibility of some of the enrollees in the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.758" offset="1548275">Mr. Fuller drafted a response to the agency, to the Department of Labor, and convinced them to continue funding the program provided that certain steps were taken to clear up the problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.815" offset="1596445">In particular, he was required to hire a new permanent project director and to reorganize and reduce the staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.919" offset="1628941">In April of 1973, Mr. Fuller hired a new project director, he terminated Ms. Burdine along with the two other employees who had been involved in the dissension in the division and retained Mr. Alan Walz who had previously been supervised by Ms. Burdine but was now promoted to the coordinating role which she had previously held.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.152" offset="1733849">Now the state concedes that Ms. Burdine established a prima facie case merely by showing that she was fired from her position and that she was replaced by a male.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.081" offset="1797587">This is not a very demanding level of proof, but under the McDonnell Douglas test, most of the steps, the four steps in establishing a prima facie case are pretty well satisfied when a person is already being employed by an agency and is then fired.</text>

            <text syncTime="881.514" offset="3659282">Because of the difficulty that a plaintiff encounters in attempting to prove discrimination in the employment context, what this Court did in McDonnell Douglas was to say that if you can eliminate there two most common legitimate reasons then the defendant will have to come forward and tell you why he fired you, for instance, in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.197" offset="3746009">And I think that normally you would expect that that would happen in the discovery stage of the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="920.156" offset="3813823">And then would be able to bring out evidence at trial that those reasons were not the real reasons for the employment decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.529" offset="3851334">In this case, the Texas Department of Community Affairs articulated two reasons for the decision with regard to Ms. Burdine, through the testimony of Mr. Fuller.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.884" offset="3892712">And those were Ms. Burdine's partial responsibility for the problems in the public service careers division pointed out by the Department of Labor and her partial responsibility for dissension in the division.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.894" offset="3952794">Since, under the Fifth Circuit's burden of proof, if a plaintiff comes forward with his prima facie case and then the defendant is unable to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he actually relied upon legitimate non discriminatory reasons then the plaintiff automatically wins the case, because there has been a failure to rebut the prima facie case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1191.460" offset="4899054">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.662" offset="4911906">Initially I would speak on the... just briefly to the fact issue raised by the counsel for the Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.204" offset="4954015">He said that there was proof in the record that the plaintiff Joyce Ann Burdine was involved in dissension within the agency and that there was proof that she was at least partially responsible for some deficiencies in the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.315" offset="5022456">I believe a close review of the record will indicate that the only evidence of that in the record whatsoever was Mr. Fuller's statements to that effect, that order than that, the evidence indicated as the Court of Appeals found, not only was that not true, that she was not involved in any dissension, that the dissension had occurred and it started before she was ever employed at the agency, that the executive director himself was at least partially responsible for it, and that she did not have authority to deal with it anyway, and she had written memorandums to her supervisors bringing forth this problem of... within her division, concerning the deficiencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.644" offset="5203850">The executive director was completely unable to point to any specific area where she was deficient in her job, and he said that there was no way to tell whether she was responsible as opposed to any other person within that division, or even himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.191" offset="5282009">Therefore, the evidence indicated that not only did the plaintiff establish her prima facie case, but the evidence of defendant substantiated the plaintiff's prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.782" offset="5340314">Initially, I would distinguish this case from Sweeney and McDonnell and Furnco, on one important ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.972" offset="5377094">And this was brought out by the Fifth Circuit, Judge Gee, in this opinion, and earlier in Turner v. Texas Instruments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.012" offset="5417218">In McDonnell and in Furnco and in Sweeney, you have a situation where the reason given by the employer, the... in articulating a legitimate, non discriminatory reason, is undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.724" offset="5488167">Such as for example, the plaintiff had a bad absence record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.627" offset="5511782">That is basically undisputed in those cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1475.487" offset="6035171">The Court of Appeals, on that issue, affirmed the decision of the lower court and in doing so, said that the plaintiff had established a prima facie case, that the defendant/employer had articulated a legitimate non discriminatory reason for its conduct; the burden then shifted back to the plaintiff who was unable to show that this was pretextual in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.636" offset="6131720">Therefore, I think it's clear that the Court did recognize the proper legal standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.339" offset="6150528">Concerning the issue involved in this case, with the Court's permission, the Court said we don't have to reach the standard of the question of pretext, because the employer has never proven that the reasons given were the actual reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="2198.843" offset="8928598">But I think the evidence in this case makes it obvious that if you, for example, on the question of upgrading, or promotion, in which the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court, the judge wrote that after making an independent review of the record he was convinced that the finding of the District Court was not clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.780" offset="9036327">Therefore, I think he in fact used the clearly erroneous test, he simply avoided the necessity of sending this case back to the District Court, of saying we need more findings of fact, and bringing it back... this case was filed in 1973 and it's been on the books this far... this long at this point, if it had to be sent back to the District Court, sent back to the Fifth Circuit, I think this rule is one of efficacy in order to keep down the burden of the District Court and it's particularly necessary where there are insufficient findings of subsidiary facts as there were in this case and particularly important in Title VII cases, where discrimination is a hard thing to prove, where the facts are always relevant, particularly in a disparate treatment case, the particular facts are extremely relevant and therefore, it's certainly a rule and even the state, in its brief, admitted the efficacy of that rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2302.530" offset="9343318">Speaking briefly again on the nature of the type of evidence needed to articulate a legitimate, non discriminatory reason, by the employer, I do not believe that this Court has of yet, clearly defined, nor has any Court, clearly defined exactly what is meant by articulation of a reason and what type of evidence is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.447" offset="9455018">In this case, I would argue that the evidence given by the employer was completely hypothetical in nature.</text>

            <text syncTime="2417.802" offset="9804432">In other words, the Court was stating that some evidence other than simply an explanation, an oral statement, is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.158" offset="9837868">And certainly Sweeney did contain that other type of evidence such as another female had recommended Sweeney for the job...

            <text syncTime="2451.040" offset="9937343">And there was other evidence that the Court pointed out and that was in that record that is not in the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.745" offset="9972242">So I would argue that Sweeney is not in conflict and that the Court has not clearly recognized or stated the standard that must be followed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2596.018" offset="10517261">It goes on to state that in this case, on this particular issue, that the plaintiff... all the evidence in the record completely disproves the reason given by the employer for his conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2615.515" offset="10595315">I think the Court certainly recognized the third step because on the first issue of non promotion it reached the third step.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.687" offset="10628020">It said plaintiff had presented a prima facie case, defendant/employer had articulated a legitimate non discriminatory reason, but plaintiff was unable to prove that this was pretext, pretextual in nature.</text>

            <text syncTime="2672.268" offset="10822267">And I think this speaks to what Justice Stevens was talking about earlier.</text>

            <text syncTime="2812.608" offset="11383690">I just would like to point out to the Court that the District Court did specifically find that Ms. Burdine was involved in the dissension in the division on page A3 of the Appendix of the Petition for Certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="2834.221" offset="11470103">"The three individuals who were terminated, plaintiff, Carraveo and Kirkland did not work well with each other and had some disagreements and in light of the Department of Labor's concern about a lack of communication within the staff and other considerations, it was certainly a rational decision for the defendant to terminate those parties.

            <text syncTime="2874.515" offset="11631331">If the defendant fails to articulate a reason, then the prima facie case would require the District Court to rule in favor of the Plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.971" offset="11673127">Once the defendant has gotten on the stand and testified that he had another reason, there's a fact question and it should not be reversed by the Appellate Court unless it was found to be clearly erroneous.</text>
