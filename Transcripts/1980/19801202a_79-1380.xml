            <text syncTime="114.001" offset="593319">The question presented is whether Section 1611(e)(1) of the Social Security Act violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's due process clause by excluding from certain public assistance benefits under the Supplemental Security Income program otherwise eligible individuals who are residents of public institutions and whose care and treatment are not funded under the Medicaid program.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.554" offset="855484">Since Appellees are between 21 and 64 years of age and are patients in mental institutions, their treatment is not funded under Medicaid.</text>

            <text syncTime="340.362" offset="1498724">As I was saying, Section 1611(e)(1), the statute at issue here provides for an exclusion from SSI benefits generally, of all persons who are residents in public institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.888" offset="1560790">However, the statute provides that a small, $25 a month benefit for "comfort items" to those individuals who reside in a medical facility which is receiving a payment under the Medicaid program to pay for the costs of their care and treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.115" offset="1645741">The purpose of this reduced monthly benefit, as expressed in the legislative history, is to allow the recipient to purchase small comfort items, such as magazines, stationery or clothing, not supplied by the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.139" offset="1697881">The statute, the statutory exclusion and exemption at issue here has the effect of denying SSI payments to all residents of public institutions whose treatment, for whatever reason, is not funded under Medicaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.991" offset="1769248">Because of their exclusion from Medicaid, persons between 21 and 64 years of age who reside in public mental institutions are not eligible for the reduced SSI benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.251" offset="1818253">Appellees are indigent individuals between 21 and 64 years of age, who are disabled by reason of mental impairment.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.234" offset="1846257">They thus satisfy the general eligibility requirements for SSI.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.154" offset="1865901">However, because Appellees are hospitalized in public mental institutions, under the operation of Section 1611(e)(1) they are ineligible for SSI benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.353" offset="1906652">They are ineligible for the full SSI benefit, because they are housed in a public institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.116" offset="1929744">And they also do not receive the reduced benefit for comfort items because their treatment in a mental institution is not funded under the Medicaid program.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.019" offset="1965375">Appellees brought this lawsuit for declaratory relief on April... challenging the constitutionality of Section 1611(e)(1) on equal protection grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.858" offset="2016679">District Court, as I mentioned earlier, certified the case as a class action and granted summary judgment for Appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.418" offset="2042906">The District Court first concluded that the statute invidiously discriminates against the mentally ill, it then determined that classifications based on mental illness are sufficiently similar to suspect classifications, such as race or natural origin to require a stricter standard of review than is normally applicable in reviewing social welfare legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="505.937" offset="2160980">Actually what the District Court held in this case was that mental illness was a quasi-suspect classification and thus entitled to an intermediate or heightened level of scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.981" offset="2197238">The only two federal courts of which I am aware, that have specifically addressed the question, have held that mentally ill individuals... or classifications, are not entitled to any kind of heightened or strict scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.818" offset="2256588">We have cited those in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.036" offset="2261395">The District Court ruled in this case that mental health classifications must serve important governmental interests and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.</text>

            <text syncTime="546.170" offset="2321999">The Court held that the statute in this case failed to pass muster under this heightened standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.856" offset="2344673">In addition, the Court expressed the view that the statute appeared to be an accidental by-product of the legislature rather than a deliberate means of serving a legislative end.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.366" offset="2394724">The case here presents a problem of line-drawing in enactment of social welfare legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.065" offset="2433489">In enacting the statutory provision at issue here, Congress drew the line at providing SSI benefits to public institution residents whose treatment was partially funded by the federal government under the Medicaid program, while leaving it to the states and local governments to provide for the comfort needs of public institution residents whose care was wholly funded by state and local government sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.213" offset="2530142">We submit that the statute is rationally based on considerations of conserving economic resources and of respect for the responsibilities of state and local governments for caring for those who are within... caring for the comfort needs of those within public institutions that are wholly funded by those local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.515" offset="2627318">The District Court, however, held that the classification at issue here is based on mental health.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.981" offset="2653231">We submit that the Court's conclusion that this statute discriminates on the basis of mental health, is incorrect, and in fact the Court's conclusion that the statute discriminates on the basis of mental health ignores the fact that individuals such as Appellees, who are disabled by reason of mental impairment are included within the SSI program in the first place, precisely because their mental condition is severe enough to warrant... to constitute a disability, and to warrant benefits under the SSI program.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.717" offset="2800144">Appellees arguments and the conclusions of the District Court, therefore, rest and fall on this tortology.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.729" offset="2832222">Moreover, it is important in this case to focus on precisely what kind of--</text>

            <text syncTime="680.195" offset="2858031">Supposing that they said you are eligible for SSI, one ground would be mental illness, but then they said, however, mentally ill people get half the benefits everybody else gets.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.830" offset="2900559">They would get in because they are mentally ill, but then they only get a lesser benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.173" offset="2918008">Couldn't they then still claim the classification was based on mental illness?</text>

            <text syncTime="731.471" offset="3063145">But one of the points that we are trying to make here is that the District Court's conclusion that the statute invidiously discriminates against them and the Court's ascribing some kind of antipathetic attitude on the part of Congress toward the mentally ill, simply is unfounded in the context of a statute that singles out people who are mentally impaired for special treatment and inclusion in the program in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.399" offset="3166903">And in fact, the statutory exclusion at issue here does not exclude the mentally ill across the board; in fact, there are large numbers of mentally ill individuals who do qualify for the reduced SSI benefit.</text>

            <label>Mr. Elliott Schulder</label>
            <text syncTime="945.213" offset="3918080">Well, we would argue that if the SSI exclusionary provision is read together with the medicaid eligibility provision that sprecifically applies to the appellees, the only factors that are really at issue here are age and presence in a public mental institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.954" offset="4009091">And we submit that niether of these two factors requires a heightened level of scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.514" offset="4035318">First of all, this court held in Massachussettes Retirement Board versus Mergy and Vance versus Bradley that age isn't a factor that requires heightened scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.040" offset="4077427">As to presence in public mental institutions, the fact that certain indivduals have to go to a public mental institution because of indigency does not require heightened scrutiney as this Court pointed out in Harris versus McCray.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.909" offset="4140957">Indigency is not a factor that calls for any heightened judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.173" offset="4165930">Similarly, presence in a public mental institution is not an immutable condition determend by accent of birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.436" offset="4191008">Some of Appelleees, as the record points out, were voluntarily committed to public mental hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.996" offset="4217235">In fact, Appellees brief points out on page 28, footnote 12, that the medium length of stay in a mental hospital is 41 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.977" offset="4257150">On the basis of that bit of evidence, we submit that presence in a mental institution certainly is not an immutable characteristic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.551" offset="4291527">And third, the political powerlessness of public mental institution residents is based, at least in part, on legitimate considerations that these people are simply unable to contribute equally to the political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.280" offset="4350355">This is not a factor like sex or race, where disparate treatment is not a function of ability, but is simply a function of stereotyped views and discriminatory treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.823" offset="4392568">It's more like the factors of intelligence or physical disability that were discussed in the plurality opinion of frontiero.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.288" offset="4438439">Because the statute does not discriminate against the suspect or quasi-suspect group, we submit that it need only have a rational basis to pass muster.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.984" offset="4477205">As we've shown in our brief, the statute meets this test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.889" offset="4512836">Congress could limit benefits to those it was already helping under other programs, such as the Medicaid program here, and it could determine that the needs of these... of others who are not covered under Medicaid should continue to be met by the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.994" offset="4553274">Now, Appellees argue that the same reasons that support the Medicaid exclusion that was upheld in Legion do not support the SSI exclusion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.864" offset="4596742">But we do not argue that precisely the same reasons support both exclusions; Medicaid and SSI are two separate programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.393" offset="4630805">In enacting the statutory exclusion here, Congress was painting with a broad brush and was not limiting the exclusion to those within a particular Medicaid eligibility provision at issue in Legion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.965" offset="4681169">The line in this case is one between public institution residents whose treatment is funded by Medicaid, and those whose treatment is not funded by Medicaid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1338.665" offset="5491906">The Supplemental Security Income program is a wholly federal program, providing public assistance benefits to indigent, aged, blind and disabled people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.847" offset="5532657">One important component of that program is this grant of $25 a month income maintenance for those people who reside in public or private medical institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.389" offset="5582812">The government has tried to characterize the program as excluding residents of public institutions generally, and as involving no discrimination at all against the mentally ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.166" offset="5629937">But this ignores the broad grant of eligibility to virtually all aged, blind and disabled residents of medical institutions whether public or private, and the contrasting special exclusionary rules for certain mental institution residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.504" offset="5687302">The framework is created by the incorporation of the receipt of Medicaid as the trigger for SSI eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.000" offset="5725231">But under the Medicaid statute, virtually all residents of medical institutions get Medicaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.606" offset="5755742">That includes residents of hospitals, including specialty hospitals and residents of hospitals and wards treating psychiatric diseases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.259" offset="5798270">It includes skilled nursing homes and intermediate care facilities; Medicaid also includes people over 65 and under 22 in mental hospitals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1471.970" offset="6025117">But it is Appellees, who are 22 to 64, and in public mental hospitals, who are excluded from SSI because they are excluded from Medicaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.996" offset="6073287">The SSI program, let me first talk a little bit about the nature of the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.993" offset="6101290">The government has argued that this doesn't discriminate at all against the mentally ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.039" offset="6117382">We agree the statute discriminates to some extent among mental patients as well as against mental patients, but that doesn't alter the nature of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.879" offset="6156774">This Court has frequently considered cases in which statutes discriminated both among and against women, illegitimate children, and aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.250" offset="6190315">But the Court in each case identified the discrimination... the discriminated group, as aliens, women or illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.153" offset="6225842">The statute and the legislative history of the medical assistance provisions that have been incorporated into SSI, demonstrates mental health status of Appellees plays a key role in the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.882" offset="6280804">The original medical assistance provisions excluded persons who were diagnosed as having psychosis and being treated in a medical institution as a result thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.144" offset="6313822">Those provisions have been narrowed since the current provision, excludes the Appellees from Medicaid because they reside in an institution for mental diseases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.185" offset="6358022">And it is this exclusion that Section 1611(e)(1)(B) incorporates into the SSI statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.011" offset="6389368">Thus, the Secretary's suggestion that mental health status of Appellees is irrelevant to the SSI exclusion is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.429" offset="6418939">The $25 benefit at issue here is in some senses small but its significance to the Appellees is great.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.755" offset="6444330">For residents of a mental hospital, as for residents of any other medical institution, the $25 a month grant represents the ability to obtain the rudiments of a barely decent existence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1988.748" offset="8092239">Because we do believe that it's not necessary to reach heightened scrutiny here, that the exclusion is so patently irrational that the Court can strike it down on irrational basis grounds without reaching heightened scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.179" offset="8138005">The Secretary's sole contention is that Congress will simply say, well maybe the states will take care of these personal needs for people who are not in institutions that aren't receiving Medicaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.892" offset="8192862">But that argument is flawed in several respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.782" offset="8204356">First, the argument is simply conclusory, it's merely descriptive of the statutory result, but has no content that's related to a function of the SSI program or the Medicaid program, or any other concrete concept of governmental interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.197" offset="8262035">Second, it misapprehends the nature of the SSI program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.493" offset="8275200">Congress created SSI to take over existing state income maintenance responsibilities, in part because of the inadequacies of the prior state income maintenance programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.238" offset="8318250">SSI dramatically altered the previous governmental roles and responsibilities for providing public assistance to the aged, blind or disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.251" offset="8354299">When the federal government has created a federal program, like SSI, like food stamps, like Social Security, to meet a perceived need, irrational discrimination in that program between similarly situated people can't be justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.822" offset="8420546">And this Court has never suggested that it can be justified by a hypothesis that the need may be met by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.366" offset="8454714">That approach would simply subvert the Congressional determination, like the one here, that such needs were not being met, or were not being adequately met, or should be part of a federal income maintenance program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.580" offset="8503615">In the Social Security, illegitimacy and gender discrimination cases, the Court has never suggested that state AFDC programs, which would cover illegitimate children or women and children, justify exclusion from Social Security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.214" offset="8566100">The same is true with the food stamp cases the Court has decided on constitutional grounds, Moreno and Murry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.351" offset="8590655">Traditional state assistance roles are no excuse for irrational exclusion in federal programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.694" offset="8612075">Third, the federal $25 grant is a federal grant to meet a Congressionally determined element of need for people in medical institutions generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.955" offset="8653140">It's not simply a bonus for the happenstance of eligibility for Medicaid programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.204" offset="8666097">As the Secretary agrees, the needs of Appellees exist, regardless of whether Medicaid subsidizes the state's cost for institutional care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.824" offset="8708519">But the government's argument ignores the Congressional determination of purpose and the importance of the SSI benefit itself, and the importance of the federal role on income maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.914" offset="8748957">Congress found this to be an unmet need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.069" offset="8757525">There is no indication that any state, including New York, provides such a grant to meet these needs; Medicaid is withheld in part because states are not meeting the needs of mental hospital residents, that's why Congress originally did not give the Appellees Medicaid and we do not dispute that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3038.781" offset="12292415">I believe that the Ninth Circuit, in its opinion in Baur v. Mathews, at 578 F. 2d at page 233, deals with this specific objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.636" offset="12339853">In fact, the Ninth Circuit in that case refers to the legislative history as indicating that Congress considered efficient and an economical method of providing SSI assistance as one of the important factors that it was taking into consideration in structuring the SSI program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.222" offset="12418116">And the Secretary has also interpreted this provision as reflecting Congressional intent to prevent the shift of public institutional programs which are traditionally the responsibility of state and local governments, to the federal government.</text>
