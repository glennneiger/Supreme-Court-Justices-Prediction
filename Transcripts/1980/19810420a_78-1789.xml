            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="147480">We'll hear arguments next in Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company v. Hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.982" offset="175379">Mr. Goldberg, you may proceed when you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="reuben_goldberg" startTime="59.070" stopTime="585.468">
            <label>Mr. Reuben Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="59.070" offset="383731">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="64.287" offset="404525">This case involves a suit filed by the respondents in the State Court of Louisiana with respect to a contract that is on file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as the respondent's Rate Schedule No. 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.902" offset="491042">In that suit they sought damages which were in fact a claim for a retroactive rate increase under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.509" offset="525420">The respondents were successful in that suit and it is petitioner's position that the decision of the court below violated the Filed Rate Doctrine, violated the primary jurisdiction of the Commission and its exclusive rate jurisdiction and Commission regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.671" offset="614131">And I should say to the Court that these positions were steadfastly maintained through each of the courts through the State of Louisiana, the trial court as well as the courts of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.010" offset="667421">The contract between petitioner and respondents provides for the sale by respondents to petitioner at the wellhead of the entire stream of wet gas from respondents' wells located in the Sligo field in North Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.861" offset="754879">I should say at this point that gas is known as wet gas when the gas stream contains liquefiable hydrocarbons.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.075" offset="799705">These liquefiable hydrocarbons exist in the gas stream in a gaseous state and they are extractable through a simple process at a processing plant at the surface.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.460" offset="861250">When these liquefiable hydrocarbons have been extracted, the gas stream is known as dry gas or residue gas, and the terms are used interchangeably.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.204" offset="912241">Now, to return to the contract which is at the seat of this case, the negotiations leading to its execution were quite lengthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.589" offset="969815">The respondents wanted a provision included in the contract which is known in the industry as a favored nation provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.523" offset="1009521">They wanted one that would escalate fixed prices that had been agreed to in the contract if any buyer of gas in the Sligo field paid any seller a price higher than the fixed prices in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.329" offset="1076708">They also wanted the favored nation provision to apply to liquefiable hydrocarbons and to condensate, which is a form of crude oil that at the surface without any processing drops out; it becomes a liquid and drops out in the separator.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.055" offset="1155598">The favored nation provision that finally emerged when the petitioner rejected these proposals of respondent is the one that appears in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.519" offset="1209514">It's in the Joint Appendix at page 99.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.893" offset="1222993">It does not apply to hydrocarbons and condensate and is triggered only by the purchase of gas by petitioner in the Sligo field from... and I quote these words, because they are important... "another party seller" at a price higher than the fixed prices established in the contract for the wet gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.617" offset="1329887">The favored nation provision provides that in determining whether a given price is in fact a higher price, the provisions of the contracts being compared bearing on that determination such as point of delivery, delivery pressure, are to be compared and adjustments made for the differences between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.730" offset="1434376">Only when the differences are found and adjustments are made for them can it be known whether in fact the favored nation was triggered.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.788" offset="1482546">Petitioner also agreed to a proposal that had been made by respondents for the elimination from the contract of payments for extracted liquids in return for an increase in the price for the gas of 1/4 of a cent.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.889" offset="1566974">The favored nation provision during the negotiations received so much attention and was so carefully dealt with by the petitioner that it actually became thereafter the model for petitioner's favored nation provisions in contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.381" offset="1648998">In 1954, after this Court in the Phillips Petroleum case had declared that producers of natural gas selling gas in interstate commerce were subject to the Natural Gas Act, the respondents filed a contract and secured from the Commission certificates of public convenience and necessity to make the sales as required by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.573" offset="1757772">And as I have said before, at the outset, it's the respondents' Rate Schedule No. 4 on file with the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.602" offset="1789851">Some years later, in 1961, the petitioner acquired an interest in a United States Government mineral lease of lands in the Sligo field, the very same field.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.939" offset="1855157">Petitioner, having acquired that interest, thereby became obligated to make royalty payments to the United States for the value of the extracted liquid hydrocarbons and condensate and for the value of the residue or dry gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.790" offset="1930598">The lands involved in the government lease had been withheld for a time by the Government from production and development but it developed that adjacent landowners were draining the minerals from underneath the Government lands and the Government opened them up to development and that produced the government lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.515" offset="2033521">And it is interesting that the Hall group... I refer to the respondents sometimes as the Hall group... had land adjacent to the government lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.384" offset="2076989">Petitioner's acquisition of the interest in the government lease was not concealed from anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.631" offset="2117949">The petitioner had no reason to keep the matter hidden; it did not keep it hidden; and it could not have been kept hidden from knowledgeable, active oil and gas men such as existed in the Hall group.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.936" offset="2199137">Additionally, the papers assigning the interest to the petitioner and the approval of the assignment was a matter of public record.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.055" offset="2251696">It was recorded in the Recorder's Office of Bossier Parish, and actually, in the 1962 report to its stockholders, the petitioner discussed in that report its interest in the lease and its activities thereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.032" offset="2331526">And I should say right here that despite the charges of fraudulent concealment by the respondents in the lower courts, the trial court made no findings on the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.040" offset="2403624">The intermediate court of appeal, the Court of Appeal of Louisiana, found that there was no fraudulent concealment and that finding was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State of Louisiana, and the fact is there was no concealment of any kind of the facts with respect to the lease, fraudulent or otherwise.</text>

            <text syncTime="585.468" offset="2489305">Well, but the respondents' position as I understand it, Mr. Goldberg, is that Arkla had a duty under the contract to report that they were getting a higher price from the United States than they were getting from the respondents.</text>

            <label>Mr. James Fleet Howell</label>
            <text syncTime="1617.453" offset="6617279">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.326" offset="6628773">Respondents respectfully submit that the core fundamental issue presented in this case involves the separate and independent obligation of the petitioner herein, Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company, to respond in compensatory damages out of its own assets and profits for the actual losses that it wrongfully caused the 15 individual respondents herein to sustain and incur from September, 1961, through December, 1975, by continuously breaching and violating their favored nations rights under the '52 contract and by uncooperatively and effectively withholding all of the true, relevant, and material facts concerning that breach of contract from respondents from 1961 through 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.728" offset="6838380">We respectfully submit that the statement of the situation concerning the payments that Arkla made to the United States Government by opposing counsel are not precisely consistent with the contracts between Arkla and the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.188" offset="6920195">An examination of Section 2(n) of the 1961 protective lease contract, Exhibit P-45, reflects that that contract anticipated the situation that actually existed between Arkla and the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.337" offset="6984770">In other words, Arkla was in a dual capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.258" offset="7000443">It was not the typical lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.196" offset="7004205">It was a lessee that was also a pipeline purchaser that owned and operated a pipeline system and a gas processing plant in the Sligo field, and under Section 2(n) of that Government lease contract Arkla was obligated contractually to purchase the Government's gas at reasonable rates and reasonable prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.594" offset="7081841">And the Government did require Arkla to pay the prices the Government felt was reasonable for the Government's royalty gas as delivered into Arkla's Sligo pipeline system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.230" offset="7120398">As evidenced by Exhibit P-82, Arkla and the Government negotiated as to the price that Arkla would have to pay to the Government for the Government's royalty gas and the explicit language of that letter contract, Exhibit P-82, sets forth so many cents per Mcf to be paid by Arkla for the Government's royalty gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.457" offset="7205243">Now, with respect to the problem that these respondents had in discovering and obtaining the true facts concerning Arkla's payments of higher prices to the United States Government for the Government's royalty gas produced in the Sligo field and delivered into Arkla's Sligo pipeline system and into Arkla's Sligo gas processing plant, I think we must begin with the fact that at the time it became necessary for Arkla to arrive at a price that it would pay the Government, one of their officials, Mr. J. C. Templeton, a vice president who was in charge of negotiating price on behalf of Arkla with the Government, wrote a memorandum on November 17, 1961, to Mr. B. E. Harrell, the senior vice president who actually negotiated our '52 contract on behalf of Arkla, and inquired of Mr. Harrell, what price should we pay the Government?</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.465" offset="7425299">Mr. Harrell came back with a memorandum dated November 20, 1961, which is in evidence as Exhibit P-58, wherein he said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.540" offset="7461557">"I have no particular opinion as to what price Arkla should pay the Government but I do wish to point out that we have a favored nations contract with Mr. W. E. Hall et al. and they are receiving approximately 8-1/2 cents at this time. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.269" offset="7520489">Here is the company official who was very familiar with the negotiations that led to the perfection of the '52 contract and he said, I do not know whether payment of a higher price to the Government would breach, activate, or trigger this favored nations clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.246" offset="7580362">But if it does, it could cost Arkla millions of dollars during the life of the '52 contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.384" offset="7604917">So, in Arkla's... in the mind of their chief vice president who negotiated the contract with respondents in '52, there was a serious question about whether the payment of a higher price to the Government would activate or trigger this favored nations clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.440" offset="7669178">One month later, on December 27, 1961, the corporate counsel, Mr. Robert Roberts, Jr., had received a copy of Mr. Harrell's warning memorandum, wrote the company, and said, in connection with the government lease contract... and this memorandum is in evidence as Exhibit P-62, he said, it's a very difficult problem in connection with the government lease, and Arkla doesn't want to buy any gas or set a price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.290" offset="7768548">So, with that background, let's look at what happened from 1961 forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.600" offset="7789864">As testified to by Frank Hall, he and his now-deceased father, W. E. Hall, Sr., went to Arkla's office month after month, year after year, from '61 to '73, to seek to determine if Arkla was paying anybody else a higher price in the Sligo field, obviously to see if they had any rights under their favored nations clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.966" offset="7879307">Each time Mr. Harrell and Mr. Miles, primarily on behalf of Arkla, told them that they were receiving the highest prices that Arkla paid to anyone else in the Sligo field, that Mr. Hall was a royalty owner, he was an overriding royalty interest owner, and a working interest owner, and he didn't delineate, are you paying a higher price for royalty gas or are you paying a higher price for working interest gas, he just said, are you paying anyone else in the field a higher price?</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.847" offset="7982856">On each occasion, they were told, you're getting the highest price that we're paying to anyone else in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.391" offset="8005008">Now, these people relied upon this, they believed it in good faith, and they had no way to check.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.263" offset="8028518">There was nothing of record as to what price Arkla was paying the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.231" offset="8044401">They didn't even know they were taking any of the Government's royalty gas into their pipeline system, or into their Sligo plant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2090.713" offset="8510321">And they set forth rather explicitly and expressly that if we were contractually authorized to receive the same prices that the Government received from Arkla for its gas and for the liquids and the condensate, that, one, if it was a severable price for the liquids and the condensate like the Government received, there would have been no Commission jurisdiction over the liquids and the condensate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2851.454" offset="11553273">Your Honor, I think examination of what happened in the case of Western Natural v. Cities Service Gas Co., a case arising through the Oklahoma state courts, this Court having denied cert and dismissed the appeal, and then the adjunct case going before the FPC and before the D. C. Circuit Court of Appeals where Cities Service Gas Company breached and violated a 1949 private gas sales contract... ours was a 1952 contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.003" offset="11683467">They withheld their cooperation, that is Cities Service Gas Co. withheld its cooperation, prevented Western Natural from getting an abandonment under Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.266" offset="11728502">They prevented Western Natural from filing a new contract with the Commission as a new rate schedule under Section 4 of the Act, and they prevented Western Natural from getting higher prices for its gas sold in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.665" offset="11778135">Western Natural went to court, that proved that Cities Service had withheld its cooperation, preventing them from getting Commission approval to abandon and to file a new contract with the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.130" offset="11819931">They recovered compensatory damages for the breach of contract and for failure to cooperate of over $5 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.269" offset="11848456">The Oklahoma Court of Appeal affirmed that judgment, this Court denied the Cities Service's appeal, and dismissed its petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.531" offset="11885550">Then it went before the FPC and the FPC recognized and delineated between the obligation of a pipeline company to pay just and reasonable area rates for natural gas sold in interstate commerce, and the obligation of a pipeline company to respond to compensatory damages out of its own pocket for losses caused by the breach and violation of private contractual agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.585" offset="11973740">And I thnk the decision of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals clearly recognizes that there must be some measure of protection for people who sign these contracts, because this court has held time and time again that the Natural Gas Act did not destroy the integrity of private supply contracts, but if this court holds that we're caught in a Catch-22, where they breach the contract, withhold the facts, prevent us from making a notice filing, then we cannot recover damages, then in truth, in fact, the integrity of this contract is completely destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.883" offset="12118980">Fifteen citizens who contracted in good faith with Arkla have been wrongfully injured and damaged, and I just think the result is so inequitable, especially in light of the fundamental priinciples that this court has passed down case after case starting with United States versus Peck in 1880, that a party to a contract that prevents the performance of that contract may not rely upon its own breach of contract, its own inequities, its own fault, to escape its own liability for the losses caused by that breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.949" offset="12243219">And I respectuflly submit under the rational of this court's deicions in NAACP versus FDC decided by this court in 1976 that a pipeline company, whether it breaches civil rights, employment rights, rights under contracts, or commits torts, the damages that it must pay because of these types of conduct, or these types of injuries must be absorbed by the company out of its own private corporate assets and profits and not included in its rate base or passed on to the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.937" offset="12363173">Because breaching contracts or injuring someone through the violation of their civil rights or their employment opportunities is not a legitimate function of a pipeline company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.963" offset="12411238">A pipeline company is supposed to honor contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.227" offset="12420329">It's supposed to fulfill contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.212" offset="12428270">It's supposed to honor people's civil rights as well as their private rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.365" offset="12444884">And if the Court is worried about the consumers having to pay any of these damages by Arkla passing it through, Arkla has to pursue that through a separate proceeding before the Commission and receive Commission approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.236" offset="12500368">If the Commission is concerned about Arkla trying to pass any of this corporate damage obligation on to the public, the Commission can simply deny the attempt to pass through and make Arkla, the wrongdoer that caused these losses and damages, simply stand behind its obligation to make these people whole.</text>

            <text syncTime="3129.438" offset="12665149">Mr. Frank Hall, one of the respondents, was having lunch at the Freeport Petroleum Club in January, 1974, when he inadvertently overheard a conversation between two gentlemen assumed to be employees of Arkla talking about the prices that Arkla was paying the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.445" offset="12729201">That's the first time any of these respondents had any idea that Arkla was paying a higher price to the Government or paying any price to the Government at all, and so, if laches would occur, it would seem like January of '74 would be the earliest time that they could have taken any action, and what they did after that was, they wrote letters to Arkla and called Arkla and asked them to give them the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.530" offset="12833586">And Arkla continued to withhold the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.528" offset="12845498">Will Hall, Jr., wrote letters to the Department of the Interior and asked them to tell him what prices Arkla was paying the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.244" offset="12872456">The Department of Interior took the position that that was privileged proprietary information, what the Department of Interior was receiving for we, the people's royalty gas, and refused to give them the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.866" offset="12914879">So they had to hire me in May of 1974 to simply obtain the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.520" offset="12929508">They didn't have the facts when they retained me in 1974, and pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act I finally received the information.</text>

            <text syncTime="3223.320" offset="13040685">Immediately before the noon recess I was addressing some questions about laches, and would like to follow that through, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.737" offset="13098363">As I was saying, that I had not been able on behalf of my clients to obtain the true facts until I received a letter from the United States Department of Interior dated June 24, 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.620" offset="13173909">That's in evidence as Exhibit P-142, where the Department of Interior advised me on behalf of these respondents as to the actual prices that the Government had been receiving from Arkla for its royalty gas in Sligo field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.177" offset="13232110">At that time I made a written demand upon Arkla for a full disclosure of all of the true facts, specifically, copies of their contracts with the Government and specifically all of the information concerning the prices that Arkla had been, was then paying to the United States Government, copies of checks, and other sales reports and production reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.792" offset="13322598">And that amicable plan was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.416" offset="13333047">In essence they forced us to file a lawsuit to judicially discover all of the truth, relevant material, and necessary facts from Arkla's own files and records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.334" offset="13372753">And as the record in this case will reflect, we went through about two years of litigation which were devoted solely to discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.268" offset="13412460">We had to file motion after motion and obtain order after order in order to obtain all of the true facts necessary to prove the breach of contract and to prove the losses and damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.544" offset="13461570">And the issue concerning obtaining a waiver of the notice filing requirement only came up, as I said, in 1979, when the FERC staff counsel suggested that in order to obtain the damages for the dry residue gas from '61 to '72, that we should think of obtaining a waiver of the notice filing requirement, which we very promptly filed for in May of 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.159" offset="13560104">And the waiver application was based on two contentions, one in light of the Western Natural v. Cities Service litigation that a waiver should not be necessary when it's a breach of contract that prevented you from making the filing in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.605" offset="13625828">But that if it was, we were entitled to it, because Arkla, by breaching the contract and withholding the facts from respondents for 14 years and then requiring respondents to go through six years of litigation to discover and prove the true facts, certainly the 20-year period that had elapsed was the fault of Arkla and not the fault of these respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.348" offset="13704822">And, of course, after the waiver was denied on November 5, 1980, we immediately filed a petition for rehearing with the Commission which was denied on January 2.</text>

            <text syncTime="3413.730" offset="13802311">The Commission had declined to grant a waiver of a Section 4(d) notice filing for a five-year period prior to '71, and the Court of Appeals, the D. C. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the Commission to grant a waiver if it found that the prices provided for under the contract were below area rate ceilings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.269" offset="13880469">And so it reversed and remanded to the Commission to grant the waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.704" offset="13894262">In the Piqua case, decided by the Commission in 1978, the Commission granted a waiver saying that the Commission had a long history of granting waivers where through some inequity there was the noncompliance with the procedural notice filing requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.838" offset="13966778">And they said, in order to protect the integrity of the contract and the true intentions of the parties, they should grant a waiver to clear up the absence of the prospective notice filing requirement.</text>
