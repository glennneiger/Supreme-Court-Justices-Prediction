            <text syncTime="18.494" offset="239725">The Crow Indian Reservation created by the treaty of 1868 is an area of approximately 2.2 million acres located in the State of Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.238" offset="282775">About 400,000 acres of that land is in tribal hands and is located in the Pryor Mountains of the Big Horn Mountains, and there are no issues involved in this case affecting that particular land.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.640" offset="332408">Approximately 30 percent of the Reservation lands are owned by non-Indians, approximately 43 percent of the population of the Reservation is non-Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.745" offset="384757">The Big Horn River is a navigable river that rises in the State of Wyoming and flows for many miles before it reaches the State of Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.131" offset="426344">It is a navigable stream and within the heart of the Reservation flows for approximately 45 to 50 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.300" offset="454974">In the Big Horn Mountains area, the Yellowtail Dam, a federally funded project, has been built, which backs up a reservoir of approximately 70 miles, which extends into the State of Wyoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.450" offset="515578">The building of that dam created an excellent cold water fishery.</text>

            <text syncTime="125.575" offset="668133">They are exotic to the Reservation, are not indigenous, and were introduced into the Reservation by the State of Montana.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.305" offset="1483049">They carved out a peculiar exception for the non-Indian fishing and hunting on his fee lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.536" offset="1515964">They held that that was authorized but still the Tribe could regulate that activity so long as that regulation was nondiscriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.658" offset="1548460">However, with regard to the non-Indian neighbors such as Mr. Lackland, who testified at trial, who owns 1,040 acres within the confines of the Reservation in fee and who lives approximately 30 miles off the Reservation, and who built a pond and stocked it with fish... oddly, that particular individual cannot under the lower court's ruling go onto that land and fish that stock.</text>

            <text syncTime="380.565" offset="1688058">But what's the irony of that situation is this, that that nonmember, as conceded by the respondents, can post his land.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.046" offset="1725988">And although the exclusive hunting and fishing right is claimed by the Tribe, nevertheless he can exclude the member from hunting and fishing on his land.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.104" offset="1762246">The State of Montana petitioned this Court, and it was granted certiorari to review the conclusions of the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.928" offset="1809475">Additionally, I would like to comment upon the fact that although there was no comment about the facts found by District Judge Battin, nevertheless, apparently on those same factual findings the lower court reached a conflicting conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.795" offset="1888992">Basically, there are two sets of issues in this case, which we will separate into what we call the ownership or river issues, and the regulatory issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.618" offset="1936222">However, both sets of issues require that a study of the treaty history and the legislative history entered into between the United States and the Tribe be undertaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.333" offset="1979167">The first treaty with the Crow and the United States occurred in 1825.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.191" offset="1998602">Basically, it was a treaty of friendship.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.065" offset="2006021">It established the paramount authority of the United States, and that authority was extended to resolve disputes that might occur between the Indians and the non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.842" offset="2053146">This treaty was followed by the treaty of 1851.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.604" offset="2080209">As the lower court observed, there was no express grant of land contained in the 1851 treaty, although a particular territory was allocated to the Crow Indian Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.444" offset="2131618">The only reference to hunting and fishing in that particular treaty was a reference that all of the tribes retained their privilege to hunt and fish on basically, I suppose, their traditional hunting and fishing grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.720" offset="2180728">This was followed by the Treaty of 1868.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.906" offset="2193475">Again, in Article I of that treaty, the United States was a sovereignty; paramount sovereignty was again recognized, and it was the only sovereign in that treaty who could sanction non-Indian intruders or malfeasors, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.272" offset="2274873">There was no jurisdiction or sovereignty which was given or granted to the tribes by that treaty.</text>

            <text syncTime="625.515" offset="2667859">In regard to that Article 2, there was reserved approximately an area of 8 million acres for the absolute and undisturbed occupation of the Crow Indian Tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.230" offset="2718746">In addition, no one was permitted to reside or go upon the Reservation without consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.945" offset="2737554">By Article 4 of that Treaty the Crow Tribe of Indians agreed to make it their permanent home.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.442" offset="2763572">However, they were given the privilege... and I put quotes around the word privilege because that word had its counterpart within the Crow Tribe.</text>

            <text syncTime="702.702" offset="2976627">The allotment policy was applied to the Crow Indian Reservation by the Allotment Act of 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.585" offset="3044127">Against this treaty and legislative backdrop is the Equal Footing Doctrine upon which the State of Montana makes its claims to the ownership of the bed and banks of the Big Horn River.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.547" offset="3111941">It's important to note that that doctrine was enunciated 26 years prior to... or at least the foundations of that doctrine were enunciated some 26 years prior to the Treaty of 1868 in the case of Martin v. Waddell, which was decided in 1842.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.853" offset="3189263">It was followed shortly thereafter by the case of Pollard's Lessee v. Hagan, in 1845.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.005" offset="3217789">I think it's also important to fasten upon why the Equal Footing Doctrine apparently came into existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.703" offset="3268571">In Martin v. Waddell, in studying the underpinnings of that particular doctrine, this Court apparently seized upon the fact that by the Revolutionary War the 13 original colonies gained their independence, and thus their sovereignty, from the King of England.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.087" offset="3350178">By virtue of that sovereignty they then became substitute for the King of England to own all of the navigable waters which were in or touched upon those 13 original colonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.596" offset="3396153">In Pollard's Lessee v. Hagan this doctrine was then expanded to those states who were not within the 13 original colonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.108" offset="3450279">And in that first case, really articulating the Equal Footing Doctrine, I think it's important to note that they said that title, by virtue of the Constitution, was not vested in the United States, it was vested in the tribe, and by virtue of the Constitution, then, in territorial days the fee title to those navigable waters was held by the United States in trust for the future states that would be carved out of those territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.172" offset="3582458">That's significant because in 1868, with regard to the Territory of Montana, that territory had already been established.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.559" offset="3628016">As a matter of fact, a number of territory acts had conceded it... Nebraska, Dakota, Washington, Idaho, and subsequently, of course, Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.694" offset="3672529">By 1868 territorial capital had been created.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.881" offset="3685276">By 1868 counties which included the territorial limits of the Crow Reservation had been created.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.628" offset="3708264">And I think, at this point, that it is significant to refer the Court to Section 2, because it becomes important as we talk about the relevancy of Choctaw Nation v. Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.075" offset="3770122">Section 2 of the Organic Act, or Section 1 of the Organic Act establishing the Territory of Montana--</text>

            <text syncTime="935.937" offset="3909511">"which, by treaty with any Indian tribes, is not, without the consent of said tribe, to be included within the territorial limits or jurisdiction of any state or territory. "</text>
            <text syncTime="950.196" offset="3966563">Now, what's significant about that?</text>
            <text syncTime="951.618" offset="3972310">That is significant because in the Treaty of 1868 the drafters of that treaty did not provide, as they did in the treaties of New Echota with the Choctaw, and the later treaty of 1835 with the Cherokee, a provision guaranteeing that the land or territory would never be contained in any subsequent state or territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.390" offset="4059350">Thus, I think that language in the territorial act is significant because they never intended that those later created Indian reservations would not be contained within a subsequent state or territory.</text>

Kneip, the surrounding circumstances, i.e., the legislation, the case law that existed at that particular time, was also important in ascertaining what the intent of the United States was with regard to the particular territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.405" offset="4531435">In Rosebud v. Kneip and DeCoteau, this Court assumed that Congress was cognizant, for example, of Lonewolf v. Hitchcock, which provided the basis for abrogation of Indian treaties; and that they were cognizant of certain other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.256" offset="4618788">I think, in regards to the Treaty of 1868, we must assume that Congress was cognizant of the Equal Footing Doctrine and the strong constitutional presumption against separating the ownership of a navigable river from a sovereign state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.640" offset="4676362">In 1868, also, I think it's significant that the Crow were a buffalo-centered culture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.918" offset="4717427">They were not dependent upon fish, again, a factor that this Court and the lower court has deemed significant in ascertaining whether or not navigable waters were contained within confines of a reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.820" offset="4765074">I cite to you Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. Alaska, and the lower court cases of Skokomish Tribe v. France, United States v. Moore, and United States v. Stotts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.300" offset="4803004">In Skokomish, of course, because of the absence of an interest or dependence upon fish, the lower court held that it would not imply that navigable waters were contained within the confines of the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.294" offset="4854935">Also, it's important that the lower court, in its factual findings, found that the Crow Tribe was not dependent upon the Big Horn River for travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.260" offset="4890880">Also, that... it's important, I think, that most of, if not all of the tribal interests in the river are preserved without actual proprietorship being conveyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.067" offset="4942080">For example, the Winters Doctrine reserves to them water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.675" offset="4952529">The U.S. v. Powers reserves to them irrigation rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.736" offset="4968724">Confederated Salish &amp; Kootenai Tribes v. Namen guarantees them access and use of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.999" offset="4993802">And of course, the fact that they are riparian to the river guarantees that they will have access to the fishing or whatever waterfowl or upland game birds are found along its shores or on its waters.</text>

            <text syncTime="2133.257" offset="8698801">I would like to touch briefly upon the regulatory issue and would say this, that if this Court's decision recently in Colt with regard to the taxing authority of the Tribes is indeed a test, which I perceive that it is, and that that test basically has three prongs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.900" offset="8829413">Number one, that Indian authority or sovereignty over a nonmember stops at tribal land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.615" offset="8872254">Secondly, that a legitimate tribal interest must be perceived in the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.956" offset="8893675">And thirdly, that there is no overriding federal policy which conflicts with the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.922" offset="8921469">If I perceive that as the present test of nonmember exercise of sovereignty, or tribal exercise of sovereignty over nonmembers, then Resolution 74-05 doesn't satisfy any of that three-prong test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.978" offset="8985730">Number one, obviously they exert their sovereignty over the nonmember on fee lands, not Indian lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.991" offset="9017809">Secondly, I don't perceive any legitimate Indian interest here, because we're talking about, not the mountain area, the 400,000 acres set aside for the tribal wildlife commissary, we're talking about the lowlands that theoretically all of which could ultimately end up in non-Indian lands; also, a commodity, a wildlife commodity in which the Indians historically have not shown a particular interest right up to the present day, as admitted by their own tribal historian.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.931" offset="9145495">They showed no particular interest in the waterfowl or upland game birds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.849" offset="9181231">Additionally, there appears to be a conflicting federal policy in that the allotment policy of 1887 and 1920 was aimed at bringing the Indian in close contact with the whites to advance Indian civilization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.963" offset="9269629">Moreover, in implementing that Act, there was an overt act by the Federal Government vesting fee title in the non-Indian without any reservations or restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.538" offset="9311947">Moreover, in the Allotment Act of 1920, although there were discrete reservations made for power sites and for mineral, there was no reference to hunting and fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.454" offset="9363565">And of course, Congress has refused the opportunity to expand Section 1165 which prohibits hunting and fishing on Indian or trust lands to include non-fee lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.840" offset="9409123">In addition, if this Court approves Resolution 74-05, it seems to me that some rather serious constitutional questions are raised, and I would just briefly touch upon those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.800" offset="9496999">This is not a case... unlike some of the others... where a tribe is trying to preserve to themselves a part of the wildlife resource.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.499" offset="9531794">They are attempting to confiscate what is normally an inherent constituent value of fee title to land, and that is the non-Indian's right to hunt and fish on his fee lands or to permit anyone he wants to to come on there and hunt and fish on that land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.633" offset="9608280">Moreover, that particular regulation or resolution has been actively supported by the United States in a number of ways ever since it's been enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.830" offset="9665123">And of course the Wilmington Parking Lot v. Burton case comes immediately to mind, wherein the forces of the state or the power of the state was placed behind discriminatory conduct, this Court said that was state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.355" offset="9719249">The action on the part of the United States in this case, under the Fifth Amendment, is much more overt and much more active, including, of course, this lawsuit itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.194" offset="9766582">And additionally, I would like to focus upon Holt Civic Club v. Tuscaloosa, which again raises a very, very serious question as to extraterritorial jurisdiction of a city.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.065" offset="9818096">There, in a split decision, this Court apparently approved the extraterritorial powers of the city because they affected nonresidents of the city, ergo there was no confiscation of the voting right; and secondly, on the basis that it encompassed only minor things, but did not encompass taxation, zoning, or eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.289" offset="9914958">All of these latter, of course, appear to be desires of the Crow Tribe to have vindicated by this particular lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.253" offset="9958844">I would like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2496.189" offset="10150582">Generally, the ownership of the bed of a river becomes important in a case where somebody wants to take sand or gravel out of the bed, or something more valuable like oil or minerals, precious or otherwise.</text>

            <text syncTime="3397.012" offset="13753809">It's perhaps important to stress that the only live controversy so far as the record in this case discloses, and indeed so far as any other information available to me reveals, is with respect to hunting and fishing on the Big Horn River.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.156" offset="13870419">There could be issues about a fee owner away from the river using his land to invite hunting or fishing parties, fishing in this case of nonnavigable ponds or streams.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.460" offset="13935621">That so far as we're aware has not become a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.288" offset="13954951">What is more, the Tribe concedes, though perhaps it need not, that it will not press its claim so as to ignore fencing or posting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.501" offset="13999778">So that as a practical matter the fee owners having been conceded by the Court of Appeals a right to hunt and fish on their own lands, the Tribe having not pressed their claim to do likewise on those parcels, the only areas which are seriously contested are the Big Horn fishery, both in terms of... and hunting of wildfowl there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.912" offset="14113462">And there is no suggestion that the riparian owner owns any part of the bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.988" offset="14145750">The only claim made is in the name of the State, and the question is whether the State by either owning the bed or by purchasing two strategically located lots on the edge of the river can effectively defeat what had been the exclusive right of the tribe to use that resource by inviting the world in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.508" offset="14255882">And we're not talking about white owners who live on the reservation, or even if--</text>

            <text syncTime="3889.549" offset="15723964">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.344" offset="15747160">The major concern to the Tribe in this case has been the claim of sport fishing by non-Indians on, over, and in primarily the Big Horn River.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.354" offset="15803167">In recent years the river has become known as a very good, in fact a blue ribbon trout stream, and has attracted many non-Indians from Montana and across the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3925.582" offset="15868160">Plaintiffs' Exhibit 30, which appears at page 25, Volume II, of the Joint Appendix indicates surveys that have been taken of the fishermen on various weekends in 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.217" offset="15926674">One of the major concerns of the Tribe is illustrated in that survey, and that is, the majority of people who are fishing on the river, and the majority of the people who are duck hunting in the vicinity of the river and over the river are non-Indians who are not local residents, but rather non-Indians who come from the major population centers in the other parts of Montana, or non-Indians who come from other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.110" offset="16042240">The concern of the Tribe is two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3973.578" offset="16060107">It's to conserve the fish and game within its Reservation, within the totality of the boundaries of that Reservation, as a food source for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.151" offset="16102426">And also, it has concern about the uncontrolled influx of non-Indians into the river area, and believes that this will seriously affect the Tribe as an entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.100" offset="16150178">This Reservation is a continuing Indian Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3999.708" offset="16164597">Seventy percent of the land is owned in trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="4002.832" offset="16177136">The majority of the population are Indian residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.644" offset="16188421">The communities within the Reservation, the population centers, are Indian communities, not primarily non-Indian communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4012.875" offset="16217260">The Reservation itself, as a governmental entity, is divided into various districts which accord with the population centers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.887" offset="16261355">We believe that since the major problem is the hunting and fishing in, over, and on the Big Horn River... and that's the issue presented in this case... that the problem would be resolved, we believe, by a decision on the issue of ownership of the riverbed, a decision that would say that he riverbed is owned by the Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.313" offset="16363023">This river is not a commercial fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="4058.825" offset="16401058">There are no competing economic impacts between treaty fishermen and non-treaty fishermen.</text>

            <text syncTime="4518.627" offset="18240287">But we do not believe that in balancing the allotment acts with the original intent of the treaty, that the rights of the Tribe to exclusive use of its Reservation have been abolished to the point where they cannot exclude non-Indian sport fishermen from coming within the Reservation and using the resource.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.774" offset="18336940">There is no express indication in the record that that right to exclude others, non-Indian sportsmen, from the Reservation hunting and fishing has been done.</text>

            <text syncTime="4610.855" offset="18609240">If this Court were not to grant the exclusive right to control hunting and fishing within the boundaries of the Reservation, then I think the Reservation would become diminished without express congressional enactments.</text>

            <text syncTime="4880.778" offset="19688933">I think it's foreshadowed by the other language in the decision, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4884.806" offset="19705025">In addition to the paragraphs I've read and the Exhibit that appears at page 88-89 there's also a paragraph that indicates, at the bottom of page 89, that the Crow Tribe's action to close the reservation to the public was very unpopular with the general public and caused retaliations in the form of some economic sanctions being taken against the Tribe, not being able to get credit as easily as they might have been able to in the past, things of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4929.882" offset="19885374">In summary, I think the Tribe believes that some balancing of the treaty rights with current day situations exists, and that the 9th Circuit made a valiant attempt to do this by carving out an exception for the resident fee owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="4956.684" offset="19992581">We think there is a great deal of rationale involved with that exception, because the resident fee owner is actually contributing to the Reservation economy within the boundaries of the Reservation, in many instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4968.475" offset="20039706">The Reservation economy is an agricultural economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4973.349" offset="20059245">The non-Indian is usually leasing lands from indians and thus contributing to the support of Indians within the Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.142" offset="20098324">Also, the pressure that the non-Indian would put on the hunting and fishing within the Reservation is slight compared to the pressure that would be placed on the Reservation by virtue of the opening of the river to non-Indian hunters and fishers from without the State of Montana and a great deal from within.</text>
            <text syncTime="5006.210" offset="20190589">Therefore, we believe, with regard to the power to hunt and fish as a property right and the power to exclude non-Indians who are not residents, that power has not been abrogated from the treaty.</text>

            <label>Mr. Urban L. Roth</label>
            <text syncTime="5028.451" offset="20279614">If it please the Court, I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5030.717" offset="20288705">I'd like to comment briefly upon Crow Tribe Exhibit 71qq which apparently states that there is a shortage of fish and game caused by the influx of non-Indian hunters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5052.222" offset="20374700">The unfortunate part of that letter is that the Tribe was either unwilling or unable to support that assertion in the letter at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5063.281" offset="20418899">They basically had one witness there, the chief game warden... who, by the way, is one of eight tribal game wardens... Bud Fritzler testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="5074.668" offset="20464457">Mr. Fritzler, page 263 of the transcript, indicated that he stopped, I believe, 20 to 30 non-Indian fishermen and inquired of them what they were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5093.474" offset="20539689">At 269, I believe it is, he cited one incident involving non-Indian having coolers full of fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="5106.124" offset="20590262">Superimposed upon this and I think significant in light of this Court's recent decisions in Sea Coast Products v. Douglas, and Hughes v. Oklahoma, is the fact that the Tribe has done absolutely nothing with regard to preserving this scarce resource by controlling the acquisition of wildlife and fish by tribal members.</text>
            <text syncTime="5132.786" offset="20696947">Tribal members are free to hunt at any season.</text>
            <text syncTime="5136.894" offset="20713351">The record is replete with examples of the fact that they exercise that right in all seasons, including in the spring, when the cow elk is pregnant; including later on, when the fawn is by her side.</text>

            <text syncTime="5155.730" offset="20788689">But I think significant, as far as the issues in this case are concerned, is the xx to this day they do not have a significant interest in the fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="5167.475" offset="20835709">Moreover, as we have already indicated, it's a put-and-take fishery, and Montana was putting the fish in and its fishermen were merely taking them out again.</text>
            <text syncTime="5176.534" offset="20871967">So it wasn't a commodity that was supplied by the Tribe at all nor even introduced on the Reservation by the Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="5184.311" offset="20903000">So this bare assertion that for some reason the wildlife resource is endangered just isn't true.</text>

            <text syncTime="5196.775" offset="20952947">No, but to my knowledge, if the game is being taken for food, that's as distinguished from sport.</text>
            <text syncTime="5206.834" offset="20993175">There is a difference, isn't there?</text>

            <text syncTime="5208.146" offset="20998400">--Yes, there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="5208.974" offset="21001743">And certainly I think this Court, as in Washington v. Fishing Vessel Association, has shown a regard for Indian interests, Indian tribes having a percentage of the resource; that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="5224.139" offset="21062347">But in this particular case, if it please Your Honor, there is no evidence that that particular portion of the wildlife resource is not available to supply them with food.</text>
            <text syncTime="5241.773" offset="21132878">And I'm sure, if the pressure on the wildlife resource of the Reservation became too heavy, then the federal courts, as they did in Washington v. Fishing Vessel Association, could at the behest of the Tribe allocate some percentage of the resource to the Tribe and some percentage to the non-Indians and regulate perhaps even the number of fishermen and hunters who would enter on the Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5271.401" offset="21251369">But in doing so, they would balance the interests of both and would consider whether or not there was indeed pressure upon that resource, which, of course, there is no evidence of there being any substantive impact upon the resource in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5290.878" offset="21329319">With regard to the denigration of the Holt case, I would think that the case of Minnesota v. Hitchcock, which preceded United States v. Holt State Bank, and in which this Court made a study of all of the preexisting treaties leading up to the creation of the Red Lake Reservation would have put to rest that particular comment upon the whole case.</text>
