            <text syncTime="208.791" offset="984685">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="214.899" offset="1009136">The State of Minnesota is here today asking this Court to review and reverse a decision of the Minnesota Supreme Court which struck down supposedly on equal protection grounds a Minnesota law which would have stopped the sale at retail in Minnesota of milk in single-use throwaway bottles which are made 100 percent from oil and natural gas resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.888" offset="1105058">In reality, however, this case deals with the question of whether we should return to the days when the courts under the banner of substantive due process interposed their judgment upon the legislature in terms of determining the wisdom and expediency of given pieces of legislation and weighing evidence and testimony pro and con to determine whether a particular piece of legislation will best do the job set out for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.343" offset="1234939">The statute in question was proposed by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and passed by the Legislature in the spring of 1977 as an implementation of general State policy and additionally as a reaction to a specific set of circumstances which were then existing within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.648" offset="1312156">In general, the agency and the Legislature recognized the ridiculous waste of resources and energy, and particularly fossil fuels, in many circumstances, as well as the unnecessary disposal problems which had been created by the proliferation of single-use packaging which serves no other purpose but convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.918" offset="1421244">The legislative policy was to discourage such packaging, and the plastic jug here in issue is a prime example of that type of a package; and encourage better alternatives where they're available, in this case alternatives such as returnable containers either in plastic or glass, which have a long history in the milk industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="456.128" offset="1974099">The specific situation that the Legislature was reacting to, as I indicated in my prior answer, is that the milk industry, major dairies within the State, were on the verge of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in commitment to long-term production of these plastic jugs, and the machinery necessary to produce these plastic jugs is both expensive and has a long useful life.</text>

            <text syncTime="779.154" offset="3266116">Both the parties here that have been selling milk in plastic containers and other dairies, most other dairies in the State of Minnesota, are selling milk in paper containers, either paper containers in addition to plastic or paper containers themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.005" offset="3345528">And one of the rational reasons why the Legislature could well have chosen to first halt plastic and hope for some voluntary movement towards better containers is that if you pick a point in time and ban both plastic and the paper containers at the same time you've got almost every dairy in Minnesota scrambling to convert.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.869" offset="3449077">And I think it's reasonable for the Legislature to take the point of view that we'll stop the plastic container, which is the single greatest competitive enemy to better containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.960" offset="3489410">The record shows that at least in other states the plastic throwaway jug has made its gains at the expense of returnables.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.831" offset="3528907">One party, Wells Dairy from Iowa, purchased a plant which was producing in pouch-type containers, which the data shows are environmentally preferable, and discontinued that in order to go to the plastic.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.245" offset="3594527">So, hopefully, if we remove the greatest single competitive enemy to more environmentally sound containers, there may be some voluntary movement in that area.</text>

            <text syncTime="875.208" offset="3650429">Certainly the option that you suggest and the option that was suggested by the Minnesota Supreme Court would more quickly accomplish the environmental goal, but I think that it's at the expense of other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.829" offset="3704868">I think the past decisions of this Court in many cases permits the Legislature to choose a step at a time approach if it feels that that is called for in the given situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="906.321" offset="3774876">You make the argument that the Minnesota Supreme Court decided this case on substantive due process analysis, and I would certainly agree there's a good deal of language in the opinion that I would construe that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.643" offset="3836107">And yet I also read the opinion of the trial court saying positively that the purpose of the statute, despite what the Legislature said, was discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.607" offset="3895980">Its purpose was to discriminate against the plastic industry, not represented in Minnesota, but outside of that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.038" offset="3937672">And the findings of fact of the trial court were found by the Supreme Court on an independent review of the evidence to be incorrect.</text>

            <text syncTime="959.019" offset="3985632">I think there are a couple of problems, many problems, with the findings of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.765" offset="4028578">I think the problem with the District Court was that it clearly said that it felt it was its job to review, weigh, and balance the evidence, because the District Court saw itself as the initial fact finder.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.649" offset="4080196">The Minnesota Supreme Court, first of all, did not I believe adopt the finding that the Act had a protectionist motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.958" offset="4117394">I think the Supreme Court, our Supreme Court noted at A-35, I think it is, in the Appendix, that the Act unquestionably deals with a proper public purpose, thus rejecting the theory of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.186" offset="4178312">But a problem that our Supreme Court shared with the trial court is that they tended to agree that the trial court was the basic fact finder rather than the Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.414" offset="4235259">So it's our contention that based on opinions of this Court, recently reaffirmed in such cases as Exxon v. Governor of Maryland, City of New Orleans v. Dukes, is that it is the legislative judgment that must stand, so long as there's any rational basis to support it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1490.646" offset="6112104">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.958" offset="6121404">I propose to first explain the Federal Government's interest in and participation in this case; and secondly, to capsulize more briefly than I had expected where the Minnesota Supreme Court went wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.707" offset="6176365">And then I will turn to the Commerce Clause issues that I think are behind Mr. Justice Powell's questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.080" offset="6197890">The federal interest in this case is really two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.156" offset="6214191">First, we wish to encourage efforts like that of Minnesota to conserve nonrenewable fossil fuels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.248" offset="6242507">The recent opinions of this Court and several recent enactments of the Congress have manifested the important national interest in conservation of nonrenewable resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.163" offset="6290155">The Minnesota Supreme Court, however, in our view took insufficient notice of this statutory purpose and concluded that the use of oil and gas in plastic containers, plastic milk containers, was small and that in any event plastic can be recycled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.220" offset="6358387">Therefore there was no need to give serious attention to the problem of depletion of non-renewable fuels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.905" offset="6385136">The problem is that if you multiply the oil and gas used in milk cartons in Minnesota across 50 states, a cross-patching not only for milk but for other beverages and foodstuffs and over time, then the problem may indeed be substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.491" offset="6455562">As for the question of the recycling of plastic, there is nothing in the evidence to indicate that the plastic container in Minnesota or anywhere else, in fact, is recycled or that recycling is feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.673" offset="6500284">The Legislature certainly could have concluded to the contrary, and in any event, even if recycling of plastic was a way of reducing the dependence on non-renewable fuels, the Legislature was free as a matter of constitutional choice to select another alternative for dealing with the problem of solid waste disposal and energy misuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.647" offset="6608117">The second Government interest, federal governmental interest in this case, is in solid waste disposal generally and more particularly in beverage container disposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.222" offset="6642390">There are a series of federal statutes that bear upon this question, most particularly the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.498" offset="6683559">A federal interagency commission convened pursuant to that statute addressed the question of beverage containers, beverage container disposal, contemplated whether or not to pass a national statute and decided instead to look to the states and see what the states' experience would be in various methods directed to beverage container disposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.361" offset="6799020">Now, that proposal was directed to beer and soft drink containers but the same notion of using the states as a laboratory applies with equal force to milk containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.733" offset="6844473">Indeed not only is it in the Federal Government's interest to use the states' experimentations in this area as a laboratory, it's in the interest of each of the individual states including Minnesota to take a step and look empirically at their experience and then take the next step.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.588" offset="6903928">The experience of Vermont in this respect, we find, very instructive, and that's detailed in Footnote 6 of our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1880.683" offset="7672241">First off, this Court has recognized in the United States v. O'Brien that legislation which on its face is constitutional ought not to be struck down because some legislators have made statements without which the statute would survive.</text>

            <text syncTime="3374.870" offset="13649058">Very few legislatures state exactly that they are going to cast an undue burden on commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.616" offset="13684062">But the practical effect of the statute... and which it is here... no chemical industry in Minnesota, no plastic industry; there is an extensive timber industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.973" offset="13717394">This Court is aware of a number of recent cases by hit, just in regard to this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.827" offset="13768907">The evidence convinced the Minnesota court that the purported State goal was environmental protection, was illusory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.185" offset="13798269">At least the trial court found that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.932" offset="13801299">And that's the same result as this Court determined in regard to Raymond Motor Transport.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.883" offset="13825123">Then the State of Wisconsin said, we're going to promote highway safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.976" offset="13841423">This Court said, the evidence did not permit that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.631" offset="13852081">Hunt and Lewis: we're going to protect the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.364" offset="13867023">This Court after an examination of the evidence found in the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.236" offset="13886459">Philadelphia v. New Jersey, environment and public health were going to be supported by this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.951" offset="13941316">This Court after review of the evidence found that it was illusory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.402" offset="13959183">A slight or non-existent legitimate state purpose cannot justify a burden on commerce, even though the burden is slight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.570" offset="13987814">That is what I believe this Court has said in these matters, and that is the basis of our Commerce Clause argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.223" offset="14022400">The Minnesota court also found that Equal Protection was violated on the basis of no rational nexus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.987" offset="14049463">I am aware of the three-tiered approach used by this Court in that matter and of course if the approach should be abandoned, we submit that Minnesota's justification of the statute is insufficient to support the discrimination between milk containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.275" offset="14126681">There's just no... whether it's rational basis or whether it's substantial state purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.570" offset="14151863">Even if the Minnesota end be legitimate, the Court held that the means selected did not effect an appropriate governmental interest, and whereas here we contend that the end is not legitimate, the discriminatory classification cannot be related to a proper State interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.156" offset="14230125">Now, we're aware, and our court was aware of Railway Express, of Dukes, and Williamson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.982" offset="14253531">Those cases held that legislatures are free to at least perceive evils on a step by step basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="3663.694" offset="14804297">Just a couple of further comments, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.051" offset="14825717">I am not aware that the Minnesota Constitution contains anything directly parallel to the U.S. Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.454" offset="14859363">I was just paging through to find in the plaintiffs' complaint at A-8, they do not cite any State constitutional provision to base their equal protection argument in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.444" offset="14955285">Secondly, Mr. Keyes mentioned that plastic burns at a higher BTU value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.052" offset="14977750">There's a very good reason for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.145" offset="14982139">It has a whole lot more energy locked up in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.036" offset="14989662">The trial court found that it has three times, roughly, the energy that the paperboard container has in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.736" offset="15012545">With respect to the question of protecting the pulpwood industry, there's no evidence on record that demonstrates that these paperboard containers actually come from any Minnesota paper products as opposed to products of any one of a large number of other states which are engaged in the paper industry.</text>
