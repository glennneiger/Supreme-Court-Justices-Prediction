            <text syncTime="100.866" offset="573100">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="103.650" offset="584176">We suggest that the primary question before the Court is whether churches that operate elementary and secondary schools are exempt from the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, which is known as FUTA, as that Act is applied by the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.541" offset="639765">If the Court should find that these schools are not, these churches are not exempt, then we have a second question, and that is whether coverage under FUTA would violate either or both of the religion clauses of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.568" offset="691905">The petitioners are St. Martin Evangelical Lutheran Church, which is separately incorporated under South Dakota law, and it operates an elementary day school.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.894" offset="749165">The other petitioner, Northwestern Lutheran Academy, is owned and operated by the Wisconsin Synod, and it is a four-year preparatory school for entrance into one of the Synod colleges in preparation for either the teaching or the preaching ministry.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.487" offset="811546">It should be noted that all teachers are regarded as ministers of the Wisconsin Synod.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.176" offset="850312">This was found by the appeals referee in the original administrative hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.580" offset="871941">They have equal status with their preaching minister counterparts and voting rights on doctrinal matters in the church.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.436" offset="903392">Now, neither of these schools that we're talking about are separately incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.821" offset="924917">Prior to 1970 the Federal Unemployment Tax Act did not cover nonprofit or tax-exempt organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.962" offset="969430">In 1970, however, Congress required the states to cover nonprofit corporations and when it did this it created a Section 3309(b) which specifically exempted from coverage certain nonprofit employers or services.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.674" offset="1040274">Now, the first section, 3309(b)(1) has two parts, the subsection (a) which exempts those in the employ of a church, convention, or association of churches; and subsection (b) exempts those in the employ of an organization which is operated primarily for religious purposes and, which is not an issue here, which organization is operated, supervised, controlled, or principally supported by a church, convention, or association of churches.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.426" offset="1159288">Subsection (2) deals with their ministers and members of religious orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.532" offset="1187709">Subsection (3) exempted those in the employ of elementary and secondary schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.353" offset="1211010">The other exemptions are not pertinent to our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.822" offset="1228878">In 1976 Congress again amended FUTA effective in 1978, requiring primarily coverage of state and local employees, agricultural workers, and domestic workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.533" offset="1295752">And when Congress did this it eliminated that elementary and secondary school exclusion, and this is where the controversy begins.</text>

            <text syncTime="1927.438" offset="7879340">Mr. Chief Justice; may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.092" offset="7909956">Amici curiae, the States of Alabama and Nevada, submit that in order to resolve this case the Court need look no further than the plain language of 26 U.S.C. Section 3309(b)(1), Subsection (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.767" offset="7972649">The uncontradicted facts before this Court demonstrate that employees of church schools such as petitioners are</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.242" offset="8010579">"in the employ of a church, or convention, or association of churches. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.646" offset="8036179">and thus fit squarely within the statutory exemption provided by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.967" offset="8057495">The question that was raised earlier concerning the basis for federal jurisdiction, or this Court's jurisdiction over the statutory interpretation here, I think is answered by two factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.025" offset="8109740">Number one, a review of the South Dakota Supreme Court decision makes it clear they are relying solely on their understanding of congressional intent and the meaning of the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.332" offset="8154984">They state at page A-5 of the petitioner's appendix, in the opinion there,</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.069" offset="8181838">"the threshold issue is congressional intent. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.038" offset="8193750">And I think the language of that opinion is clear, that they are relying on their understanding of the Secretary of Labor's interpretation and of the interpretation of the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.746" offset="8236591">Under those circumstances, there are a number of cases from this Court that stand for the proposition that an erroneous understanding of federal law which is introduced into a state court decision is properly the subject of federal review even though the state court could choose voluntarily to read its own statute differently; where it states that it is relying on its understanding of federal law, this Court can correct such a misapprehension.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.931" offset="8357381">I think one of the best cases for that proposition is Standard Oil Company v. Johnson, which is cited at 316 US 481.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.454" offset="8395415">At page 483 the Court makes it quite clear that it will review an interpretation of the California highway tax, because the California Court interpreted that tax by reference to its understanding of federal law concerning the definition of an agency or a part of the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.319" offset="8482873">We think, equally here, the State Supreme Court has interpreted the federal law, and it has interpreted it incorrectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.723" offset="8512548">In considering whether church school employees are employed by a church as required for the (b)(1)(a) exemption, it is important to bear in mind that the statute and the implementing regulations expressly define the words "employer" and "employee", and they define them so as to incorporate into the unemployment compensation law the common law rules for determining whether an employer-employee relationship exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.659" offset="8632294">They set forth such factors as the right to control and direct the individual's work, the furnishing of the place or tools of the work, and the right to discharge the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.217" offset="8678478">In this case, as counsel for petitioners has already indicated, the church schools involved are run directly by the church or the Synod.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.839" offset="8716930">They have no separate corporate or legal existence, and therefore these schools are typical of the great variety of schools that are described in the stipulated record which is before this Court in Marshall v. Alabama and Nevada, No. 8922.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.169" offset="8790282">While those stipulations by the Secretary of Labor are not binding on the parties here, we believe they are helpful in understanding the position of the Department of Labor, which position was then adopted by the South Dakota Supreme Court in the decision that's under review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.079" offset="8857887">The Secretary has stipulated as a matter of fact that in our states all of the Catholic, Lutheran, and fundamental Baptist church schools have no legal existence separate from their respective churches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.474" offset="8919536">In those schools church officials such as the pastor or the priest hire and fire all the employees of the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.579" offset="8955898">Church officials discipline and control the work of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.115" offset="8974080">The church owns the building in which the school operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.550" offset="8987768">The employees' salaries are paid directly from the church bank account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.387" offset="9007203">Therefore we believe it is uncontradicted that every key element of the common law definition of employment as incorporated into this statutory scheme is present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.797" offset="9060806">Nevertheless, the Secretary of Labor and the South Dakota Supreme Court suggest that the word "church" should be confined to mean the physical house of worship rather than the legal entity that owns the building and hires the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.806" offset="9124858">As is set forth at some length in the briefs in this case, Congress has consistently provided for a broader definition of "church" in the Internal Revenue Code.</text>

            <text syncTime="3169.857" offset="12849084">And when one is in the employ, as an exception, of a church or convention or association of churches, I think our Supreme Court narrowly interprets that in answer to the Chief Justice's question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3198.210" offset="12962455">"Or organization which is operated primarily for religious purposes and which is operated, supervised, controlled, or principally supported by a church or convention or association of churches. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.499" offset="13007595">That's close, but we have to remember, when all these exemptions were entered, number (3) was, in the employ of a school; which has now been eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.123" offset="13046152">And so, in answer to the Chief Justice's question, these people in our opinion, as the documents we lodged show, which were lodged for accreditation purposes, they were filed by the principal of the school, and they were done in the name of the school.</text>

            <text syncTime="4166.878" offset="16837146">And in that regard, I want to talk about the monetary effect... because it's very vast, and it's very important to our state, which is, according to the Census Bureau, the poorest state in the Union... is the fact that money will flow back and forth, no matter what this Court decides.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.721" offset="16892525">And secondly... and it's important to note... these schools need not, in our state, under our system, pay any tax dollars, none whatsoever.</text>
