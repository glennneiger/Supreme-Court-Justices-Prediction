            <text syncTime="754.461" offset="3226313">In logic I think the answer to that is yes, because one of the issues before the Court is whether or not the Executive has the unfettered discretion to settle in his own whim, or for good reason, as he sees it, the claims of Americans against foreign states.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.781" offset="3303635">It seems to me that if the Executive has that power... and obviously I want to address that... if the Executive has that power to settle a claim, I suppose he can also give away the security.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.152" offset="3341147">So, in that sense, the order by President Reagan might be regarded as going further.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.133" offset="3373016">I think it goes... it certainly goes further in terms of infringements on court processes, although you get there only, I think, by an analytic process.</text>

            <text syncTime="805.301" offset="3429650">Now, the effect of these orders together on the Petitioner and its case is frankly devastating.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.734" offset="3467475">We had a judgment against two parties we were in the process of trying to levy, we had a lawsuit going on against the rest of the parties with attachments; it's all wiped out.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.121" offset="3501016">Our judgment is nullified, our judgment levies are nullified, our attachments are nullified, we can't even keep suing the parties who were still before the district court, and our only alternative is to go to The Hague with the time and expense that's involved there and quite possibly be told that we're not entitled to present our claim there, and even if we are they only have a small fraction of the money that's necessary to pay off the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.236" offset="3597461">For that reason, we filed an action below seeking injunctive and declaratory relief against the Secretary of the Treasury, and as indicated in the briefs the Government filed a cross-motion under 12(b)(6) to dismiss, our motion was denied, and the Government's motion was granted, and the district court has indicated in its memorandum that he did reach the merits, if you will, of these constitutional issues presented, because he indicated that he ruled on the basis of the arguments made by the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1957.327" offset="8037754">On the issue of the President's power alone, the Government has put in a lot of historical information which they say amounts to a practice, a consistent practice of the Executive to do just what he has done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.646" offset="8115077">And our position is that these examples and these precedents, in fact, have been totally stood on their head.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.408" offset="8146110">That is to say, historically, Americans with claims against foreigners were disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.625" offset="8174950">They had to deal with the sovereign immunity doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.405" offset="8186130">First it was absolute, then restricted but not applied very consistently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.590" offset="8210894">Even if they could get around immunity they had no way of getting personal jurisdiction over the foreign states, so they had to try to work out some quasi-in-rem jurisdiction and if they ever got as far as a judgment they couldn't enforce it, there were no execution provisions in this country for the enforcements of judgments against foreign states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.161" offset="8285186">So that, before the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, there was no practical way to really sue a foreign state in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.657" offset="8323116">And naturally, what happened is, individuals went to the Government and said, please help us, we have been hurt, our property has been expropriated, or they breached this contract, or whatever the claims were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.057" offset="8372749">And the Executive, in service to the American citizens, has tried to settle many of those claims and to be sure, occasionally a citizen has been unhappy with the result that the Executive may have obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.663" offset="8415172">But the history is of using diplomacy to aid the private citizen, not to sacrifice the rights of the citizen to aid a diplomatic goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.127" offset="8461043">It's totally turned around here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.735" offset="8467416">The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act was intended to put a category of these claims into the courts and out of the process of diplomatic settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.777" offset="8523632">Now, the Government takes the position that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act deals only with immunity, it doesn't have anything to do with settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.665" offset="8555188">I think that that really rather misses the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.616" offset="8570966">Immunity is a way of deciding which track you're going to be in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.396" offset="8594058">Are you going to litigate?</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.956" offset="8600327">Or are you going to try to settle it diplomatically?</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.534" offset="8610672">And immunity is the device by which that procedural choice is made, and this is not something that has escaped people in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.920" offset="8648184">Let me quote if I may, please, from Mr. Justice Stone, Chief Justice at the time, in the very case that is the leading case on absolute sovereign immunity, Ex Parte Peru, and there the Secretary made a suggestion of immunity, and the Chief Justice says,</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.337" offset="8709833">"When the Secretary elects, as he may and he appears to have done in this case. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.210" offset="8729372">--and I might say, there's nothing in the record other than his assertion of sovereign immunity...</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.317" offset="8741807">"when he elects to settle claims against the vessel by diplomatic negotiations between the two countries rather than by continued litigation in the courts, it is of public importance that the action of the political arm of the Government taken within its appropriate sphere be promptly recognized. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.529" offset="8814636">Now, the point is that the Chief Justice recognizes that the immunity decision is a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.745" offset="8835430">You assert it because you're going to now try the diplomatic settlement rather than litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.228" offset="8849431">And similarly, in testimony before the House committee, in enacting the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, the Justice Department... Witness: Mr. Ristau... says,</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.038" offset="8888615">"A successful plea of sovereign immunity interposed by a state does not terminate the claim. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.754" offset="8911498">"Rather, the claim is merely transferred to the diplomatic arena, which is ill-suited for the settlement of private law or commercial disputes. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.156" offset="8949114">Now, the Congress has decided in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that certain classes of cases shall not be transferred to the diplomatic arena, that the litigants shall be given the powers and the rights that go with litigation in this country, and they have redefined the jurisdiction of the United States district courts--</text>

            <text syncTime="2310.059" offset="9448680">The only argument that I have heard which admittedly was accepted by one judge, although interestingly enough he said, I accept this argument because I am terrified by the Executive's claim to this inherent settlement power which it could use at any time, not even in an emergency or not, that judge did find appealing the argument that IEEPA prohibits... I have to pick out the magic words... prohibits a citizen from exercising a right with respect to Iranian property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.969" offset="9572396">And he said, I think filing a lawsuit is such an act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2354.541" offset="9626626">That doesn't work out very well because it's pretty hard to say that the claim of the U.S. citizen against Iran is property in which the Iranians have an interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2363.631" offset="9662989">But this other one, that Judge Breyer went for, I think, is equally unavailing because a lawsuit isn't the exercising of a right with respect to property.</text>

            <text syncTime="2540.842" offset="10371847">Now, contrast that with the circumstances that exist because of the acts that were taken by the President, his January 19 orders and the subsequent order of President Reagan on February 24.</text>

            <text syncTime="3740.316" offset="15169705">But if there is no question that if there is a defect in that respect, it is a defect essentially with Congress, particularly when you take into account what this Court said in Curtiss-Wright and United States v.

            <text syncTime="3757.903" offset="15240132">But let me go on, now, to what I think is an even more significant point in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.463" offset="15270329">And that is, that even if you can't fit it within... even if you were to decide that the Hostage Act does not apply, Justice Jackson in the guidelines that he gave indicated that you get the additional force of Article I power added to Article II power when you have the implied approval of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.000" offset="15356533">This simply is not an area in which the interbranch relationships between Congress and the President have been characterized by contention and by interbranch struggle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.555" offset="15430721">Rather, it has been an area in which there has been a continuing recognition by Congress of the existence of claims settlement authority and periodic enactments to support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.723" offset="15475338">For example, at the time that the IEEPA was enacted, the Congress observed that one of the reasons that it authorized blocking orders was that they are</text>

            <text syncTime="3835.232" offset="15549421">And in addition, in such enactments as the International Claims Settlement Act and the work of the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission and the periodic reenactment by Congress reflecting the work of that Commission, in the reports that are made to Congress under the IEEPA, and generally just across the boards, this has been an area in which the Legislative Branch has recognized the existence of claims settlement authority and has periodically acted to implement and to support it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3888.757" offset="15763521">And it says,</text>

            <text syncTime="3939.064" offset="15964768">I intend to come to the Article III question in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3942.157" offset="15977098">I just would like to... well, I'd like to say before I get there, that in addition to congressional recognition this is an authority that in the language of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, quoting Professor Henkin,</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.462" offset="16050345">"is an established international practice reflecting traditional international theory. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3993.137" offset="16181062">So we're not dealing here with something that is just a newcomer in this particular case, and the proposition--</text>

            <text syncTime="4004.399" offset="16226097">But all I'm saying is that it is a practice that is well recognized, well established, recognized not only by the decisions of this Court in Pink, and it has a long paragraph on the importance of claims settlement authority by scholars and by Congress itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.939" offset="16296210">And that is as a prelude to this point, Justice Rehnquist, that the proposition that a bill that was drafted and lobbied by the two Executive Branch departments that most depend and utilize that claims settlement authority, would have had as its purpose to take away that very authority without ever saying so, almost borders on the absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.600" offset="16406865">And indeed, the few references in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to claims settlement authority are to the effect that it exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="4058.253" offset="16441555">Even the quote from Mr. Ristau, which Mr. Howard referred to, acknowledges the existence of the claims settlement authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4066.061" offset="16472693">And that brings me to the question, what about jurisdiction and what about settlement of the claims through submitting them to arbitration?</text>
            <text syncTime="4079.103" offset="16524938">The Court of Appeals... both of them... for the 1st Circuit and the District of Columbia correctly reasoned that this was an effort not to modify the power of the courts, the jurisdiction of the courts, to decide this case, but rather the substantive rule of law that the courts are to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.360" offset="16617934">All the focus of all of the executive orders is very careful on the claim, on the nature of the claim that is held by the claimants and not on the power of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4115.994" offset="16672478">And as a consequence, the judge in this case correctly dismissed this case, dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.131" offset="16713020">Now, the fact is, of course, that as a result of something that the Government has done, American courts will not be deciding some of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.455" offset="16758264">But there are a number of instances in which that circumstance is true, that has never been thought to give rise to Article III problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="4147.340" offset="16797865">For example, the Government may settle a case after it is pending in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.777" offset="16819599">In addition, prior to 1976, the Government frequently appeared in court and suggested that sovereign immunity applied, and that had the effect of taking the case away from the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4165.896" offset="16872053">And finally, it persists to this day that the Government may take a position with respect to act of state that has the effect of taking the case out of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4176.954" offset="16916357">Now, on this issue, Schooner Peggy is absolutely dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.890" offset="16932030">When Mr. Howard takes the position that with respect to the basic issue of claims settlement authority Schooner Peggy is distinguishable because it was a treaty, parenthetically, my answer to that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4196.665" offset="16995142">That it's true that Schooner Peggy did involve a treaty, but when by the time you combine the holding and the rationale in Schooner Peggy with the rationale, with the statement by this Court in Pink concerning settlement authority, that those two taken together make a pretty powerful argument for the existence of settlement authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="4246.475" offset="17194404">I do agree with that statement, Justice Rehnquist, and it is of course consistent with the trichotomy, if you will, by Justice Jackson in that same case, that it's simply a matter, if you have both the President acting with his Article II power and Congress acting with its Article I power, then it's all the stronger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.748" offset="17267443">And if you have the Congress taken away, then it's weaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="4268.152" offset="17281131">But coming back to the point of claims settlement authority, Justice Frankfurter also said... this is the clearest statement that you have anywhere... in United States v. Pink, that it is simply indisputable that the President has the claims settlement authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4283.037" offset="17340690">But, coming back to the question of jurisdiction, Schooner Peggy may or may not be distinguishable on the basic issue of the President's claims settlement authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4293.127" offset="17381023">We think that Peggy plus Pink makes a pretty powerful combination in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.594" offset="17406832">But on the issue of jurisdiction Schooner Peggy is absolutely dispositive, and a ruling could not come down by this Court that what the President did here amounts to an Article III violation without overruling Schooner Peggy for this reason: Schooner Peggy is an a fortiori case from Dames &amp; Moore on this issue, because what you had in Schooner Peggy was a final judgment, which we do not have in this... excuse me... there was a judgment out of the circuit court entitling the claimants in that case to their prize.</text>

            <text syncTime="4741.026" offset="19172605">For these reasons, we respectfully submit that on those rare occasions when a crisis such as that that occurred does occur and the opportunity for settlement occurs, then someone has to have the power to act.</text>

            <text syncTime="4807.202" offset="19437278">Despite the plethora of briefs and the numerous parties in amici, the questions presented to the Court in this proceeding are not particularly abstruse.</text>

            <text syncTime="4825.008" offset="19508540">I would submit that the attachment issues are essentially and simply issues of statutory construction and should be governed by the basic principle that statutes should be construed so as to avoid conflicts between them and in terms of international law statutes should be construed in such a way as not to cause a breach of an international agreement or international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4851.200" offset="19613343">I have in the limited time four simple points which I would like to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="4857.995" offset="19640510">The first, the Government of the United States and the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran executed an international agreement between the parties on January 19, 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="4870.741" offset="19691501">Both of the sovereigns are in the process of implementing their obligations under the agreement and each expects the other sovereign to continue to fulfill those obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4880.750" offset="19731521">As a matter of international law it is a well recognized principle that an international agreement is binding despite any contrary domestic law.</text>

            <text syncTime="4891.621" offset="19774989">Well, Mr. Shack, what if that agreement had included a provision sending Justice Stewart to Teheran indefinitely?</text>

            <text syncTime="4911.192" offset="19853252">Well, I think that Justice Stewart would probably have to pack a bag and... the short answer is, to whatever extent such an agreement would infringe upon the constitutional rights of a citizen and was struck down as being unconstitutional, it would not be binding as a matter of domestic law, and I doubt that anyone would try to put Justice Stewart on a plane.</text>
            <text syncTime="4936.947" offset="19956279">But whether the United States would be in violation of such an agreement and thus answerable for damages in such an event, I think that under international law it would be.</text>

            <text syncTime="4953.705" offset="20023361">No, that is not the question that we are faced with here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4957.923" offset="20040184">The basic question is, there is an agreement between the two countries, the United States is under an obligation to accomplish, to restore Iran to its financial position as it existed prior to November 14, 1979, and to accomplish that the United States has to assure the free mobility of Iran's assets within this jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4980.320" offset="20129732">If the United States does not in fact accomplish the restoration of Iran's financial position, and if it in fact does not accomplish satisfaction of the obligations imposed under paragraphs 4 through 9 of the Declarations, specifically the transfer of specific categories of assets to Iran, then the United States would arguably be in violation of the agreement and under international law liable for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="5006.372" offset="20234012">Since the international tribunal which has been referred to today does in fact exist, and since it does in fact have jurisdiction over disputes of this nature between the parties, then the tribunal would be in a position and arguably has the authority to impose a damage judgment against the United States in the full amount of Iran's assets as they exist in this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="5461.063" offset="22052762">No litigant nor lower court has challenged the existence of an undisputed emergency crisis situation which prompted the Executive's action here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5472.527" offset="22098633">Thus the issue before this Court is not whether the Executive generally may settle the claims of United States nationals against foreign states, although historically he's done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.288" offset="22141683">Rather the question is a narrower one dealing with whether he may do so in such an international crisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5491.425" offset="22174179">Put this way, the question highlights the reason why the Executive's power to settle claims both historically and doctrinally has been held to be a necessary element of the foreign affairs power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5508.168" offset="22241157">The claims are more than mere bargaining chips in the sense that one might... the suggestion was, send somebody over to a foreign state in exchange for some other benefit that the Government of the United States might obtain from the foreign state.</text>
            <text syncTime="5528.270" offset="22321614">Rather, the claims themselves create an impediment, a barrier, to normal foreign relations.</text>

            <text syncTime="5593.821" offset="22583779">What you have is a pattern, an historical pattern, of congressional acquiescence in approval of and facilitation of the President's foreign claims settlement power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5608.112" offset="22640935">And this pattern continued contemporaneously with the enactment of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and afterward.</text>
            <text syncTime="5618.764" offset="22683567">The very Congress which considered the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and enacted it in 1976 considered amendments to something called the Case Act, which required the Executive to make reports to Congress whenever he entered into executive agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="5637.772" offset="22759531">Several Congressmen introduced amendments to the Case Act which would have given Congress the right to override executive agreements by concurrent resolution or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="5649.502" offset="22806551">The Executive Branch... the State Department, the Justice Department... at the same time they were asking the Congress to pass the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which after all the Executive Branch drafted, at the very same time they appeared before the committees in Congress and said, don't pass this act limiting the executive agreement power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5672.054" offset="22896726">They canvassed the historical exercise of it, they focused particularly on the claims settlement power, on this Court's opinions in Belmont and Pink, and they argued that it would be unconstitutional for the Congress to limit the executive power in this way, particularly with respect to claims settlement agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="5696.529" offset="22994633">They focused on that in their arguments to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5698.450" offset="23002261">Congress, of course, did not enact the act, the very same Congress which did enact the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, without a word that it was doing anything to undermine the historical claims settlement power.</text>

            <text syncTime="5732.250" offset="23137470">One year later Congress did not think that it had done anything to undermine the Claims Settlement Act when it enacted the International Economic Powers Act, because that Congress, while it limited some of the Trading with the Enemy Act powers in times of peacetime national emergency, it specifically said these limitations do not affect the President's power to settle the claims of United States nationals against foreign states.</text>
            <text syncTime="5768.937" offset="23284279">Now, if the Congress had thought that it had taken that power away a year earlier when it enacted the Sovereign Immunities Act, it wouldn't have bothered to say that when we're enacting the Emergency Economic Powers Act, we're not taking that power away.</text>
            <text syncTime="5779.559" offset="23326701">There's another point about the Emergency Economic Powers Act that is worth emphasis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5784.822" offset="23347808">Pursuant to that Act the President must make reports to the Congress when he invokes his IEEPA powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5795.254" offset="23389500">He must say what he has done and why he's done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5797.582" offset="23398799">And the Congress may then consider whether he has acted improperly and by concurrent resolution, not a statute, it can override the President's actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5809.015" offset="23444566">And that was done precisely here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5810.498" offset="23450522">The President, both Presidents, made reports to the Congress as to what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="5816.637" offset="23475077">The Congress held hearings, three different committee hearings; they are mentioned in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5820.557" offset="23490750">The Senate Committee issued a report; there was no resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5824.914" offset="23508096">Some of the claimants came in and asked the Congress to exercise its powers to block the implementation of the Algerian Declarations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5832.521" offset="23538607">If the Congress didn't think there was a problem, as a matter of fact, the Senate report indicated a continuing recognition of the executive power to settle claims and a feeling among the Committee that this power was necessary if the United States Executive was to deal with an equal with foreign states.</text>
            <text syncTime="5854.621" offset="23627005">So that what you have here are both political branches of the United States Government recognizing this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5864.149" offset="23665039">Congress has set the terms for its review of executive implementation of the IEEPA powers.</text>
