            <text syncTime="98.247" offset="544421">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="100.965" offset="555288">I represent Petitioner J. Truett Payne Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.251" offset="568349">We filed this secondary line Robinson-Patman Act price discrimination case, resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.606" offset="609832">After a motion for judgment notwithstanding verdict was denied, in the 5th Circuit it was appealed and the 5th Circuit reversed on the grounds that the plaintiff, petitioner in this instance, must prove the specific lost sales or lost profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.401" offset="689035">And that is the only method of proving the fact of the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.120" offset="703873">And a second and underlying factor in the reversal was that the petitioner failed to prove a reasonable estimate of the amount of the price discrimination or damage and that the actual amount of the discrimination was not sufficient by which the court could estimate the damage, or by which the jury could estimate the damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.051" offset="787569">This Court is faced with the damage issues under the Robinson-Patman Act and Section 4 of the Clayton Act, which bring into focus the 5th Circuit's requirement of a plaintiff proving specific lost profits or lost sales as the only means of recovering under the Robinson-Patman Act, and whether or not that requirement imposes an inflated standard of proof thereby effectively denying private attorney generals the ability to enforce the Act and recover for a wrong; and secondly, whether or not the amount of the price differential is sufficient evidence to give a reasonable and proper estimate of the amount of the damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.516" offset="985473">The 5th Circuit in its opinion misconstrues not only the law but I believe in misconstruing the law underlying the problem was misconstruing Payne's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.757" offset="1034374">It stated that Payne claimed that in a total vacuum price discrimination alone was sufficient to give rise to an injury under Section 4 of the Act, of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.265" offset="1088395">And I submit that that is the basis upon which the court totally ignored this Court's findings and holdings in Bruce's Juices case, in 1947, and the FTC v. Morton Salt case in 1948.</text>

            <text syncTime="250.676" offset="1154119">Well, do you concede that findings of discrimination under the Act, without any evidence sufficient to survive a motion for a directed verdict, dealing with causation and damage, would be insufficient to support a monetary award?</text>

            <text syncTime="305.578" offset="1373652">But I would submit to Your Honor, Mr. Justice White, that in this case there was substantial corroborating evidence supporting an inference of injury resulting from substantial price discrimination taking place, occurring in a market where there was keen competition and in the face of tight profit margins, and where the substantial price discrimination could have been reflected in the retail sales price.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.782" offset="1494547">Now, under those circumstances the 5th Circuit didn't address that, it just said, the only way that you could prove injury is to show proof of lost sales and lost profits, but under the circumstances in this case the jury, the fact finder, whether it be a jury or a court, could have inferred injury from the existence of those factors, plus the price discrimination itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.099" offset="1599768">So, in answer to your question, I think that this Court need not address whether or not price discrimination standing alone in a vacuum gives rise to injury or competitive injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.524" offset="1657446">Because the facts of this case show a substantial supporting... substantial corroborating evidence supporting not only the proof of actual competitive injury, not just a finding of a likelihood or probability of injury, but testimony that competition itself was harmed, and support an inference that would support the jury's finding which could give rise to an inference of damage to the disfavored purchaser.</text>

            <label>Mr. C. Lee Reeves</label>
            <text syncTime="498.047" offset="2143533">--I believe, under even the standards that this Court has established on proof of damage and proof of amount of damage, that you would have to go farther than just mere self serving conclusions in the absence of any other supporting evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.426" offset="2217094">However, if... like in this case... the amounts of the price discriminations which resulted... Chrysler, in a rebate program... let me just go into the background just a moment, if it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.103" offset="2271846">Rebate programs were formulated by Chrysler whereby the amount of money that was paid to the competing dealers in the Birmingham market was determined by a quota that was reached, or not reached, by the competing dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.278" offset="2332451">The quotas were different for each dealer, and the price rebate would thereby lower the price and cause the discrimination, if everybody were not rebated the same price on the same model automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.472" offset="2393264">And in this case there was evidence of substantial amounts of discrimination occurring, sometimes several hundred dollars per automobile, in a period... we're talking about 50 or more automobiles a month, and these rebate programs lasted two and three months in duration.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.218" offset="2468287">So, when you put that, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, together with Mr. Payne's testimony, the actual fact of the price discrimination, the duration of the substantial nature of it, and the amounts of it, then I say that that would be an issue that should be submitted to the trier of fact, as to whether or not the trier of fact could infer damage without proof of specific lost sales or lost profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.703" offset="2578211">The testimony in this case showed that during a 3-1/2-year period from approximately December, 1970... November, 1973... May, 1974, when Payne went out of business, that the price discrimination totalled about $81,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.966" offset="2663265">There were 16 rebate programs which caused the price discrimination, and of those 16 programs 13 caused damage to Payne, and that damaged... that Payne was not favored, he was a disfavored dealer in those 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.078" offset="2735677">Of those other three programs, one of the programs was a program that had a quota established by Chrysler by which the dealer had to reach that quota in order to get paid and Payne reached that one quota and did not get injured in that program.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.541" offset="2809551">The other two programs where there was no discrimination were an across the board percentage rebate to everybody on a per car basis, so there was no discrimination at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.997" offset="2847376">So, out of those 16 programs over a 3-1/2-year period, Payne was injured, was a disfavored dealer in 13 of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.119" offset="2883843">There was testimony not only by Payne that his company lost business in the form of lost sales, but also that his company in order to maintain sales had to overallow on the used car trade in and that was a factor in the testimony of Dr. Ignatin and in the testimony, as a matter of fact, of Chrysler's witnesses which analyzed the used car business of Payne, saying that, one, that the main problem with Payne was its used car business was losing money.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.178" offset="3040055">So you've got the fact that Payne testified that he was overallowing in order to get business coupled with the corroborating testimony that there was a real problem in the used car business, coupled with a factor of substantial, sustained price discriminations over 3-1/2 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.657" offset="3118005">There was testimony of an actual decline in the market, percentage of the market that Payne had from 1971 and 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.663" offset="3158024">There was also testimony that the price discrimination adversely affected competition and injured competition because it had a two pronged effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.553" offset="3193551">The first thing was that it did not permit Payne to compete on an even and equal basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.609" offset="3221868">He was at a trade disadvantage because his cars cost more than the other competing dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.513" offset="3245482">Secondly, the price of a new car is determined by the discounting off of the list price, and everybody knows that, and the economist that analyzed the industry in Birmingham determined that because the competing dealers, the favored dealers, did not have to discount off list price quite as much as they otherwise would have since they were favored and Payne was not favored with the rebate, with the price discrimination, and because Payne could not discount off list price as much as he otherwise would have done because of the lack of the price rebate, that that raised the price, the ultimate retail price to the consumer in the market to a slight degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.961" offset="3447252">And the 5th Circuit in its opinion did not consider all of this evidence as giving rise at least to the submission to a jury as to whether or not injury in fact under the antitrust laws could be caused.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.157" offset="3519977">The 5th Circuit said that the only way you can prove injury is to prove lost profits or lost sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.677" offset="3550070">This Court considered the same issue in a different context in Bruce's Juices v. American Can Company, and in that case, although the ultimate finding was much narrower, the Court was faced with an analysis exactly the same as in this case, because the plaintiff in that case had said that the price discrimination statute ought to void the contract involved in the transaction where there was price discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.198" offset="3676189">The court said, and the plaintiff also said, that the treble damage remedy under the Robinson-Patman Act was ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.971" offset="3707223">This Court said, no, because all that there would be normal, or all that would be necessary in the absence of extraordinary circumstances would be to prove the substantial price differential, and that would be damage, and the amount of that damage would be that differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.551" offset="3789561">In that finding, and it's more than mere dictum... I know that Chrysler characterized it as dictum... but this court had to analyze how you would prove price discrimination how you would prove damage under the Act that would be an effective remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.744" offset="3858315">And it recognized that, it recognized what Chrysler ignores, and what the 5th Circuit ignores, and that is that the defendant in a price discrimination case would always have the chance of rebutting the inference of injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.538" offset="3929577">It's not an automatic injury rule, despite their characterization of it; it gives rise to an inference of injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.794" offset="3954550">The factfinder should be allowed to determine whether in fact there was injury or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.882" offset="3986942">And if substantial evidence is introduced by the defendant showing that these "extraordinary circumstances" exist in the marketplace, then price discrimination, whether it be substantial or sustained, is not going to give rise to the damage.</text>

            <text syncTime="1038.617" offset="4305845">Only in the context, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, of the competition in the market, because that in effect reduced the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.639" offset="4341894">There was testimony by both the expert witnesses that that reduced the price of automobiles and that the automobiles, originally, each model was priced the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.843" offset="4374704">Therefore, the product that was being sold in the market was costed, cost more to Payne than it did to the other dealers who were competing in that very same time frame under that very same program for the sale to the very same customers in that market, and that put Payne at a total disadvantage in sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.025" offset="4467491">Now, there are several things that can happen when that occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.329" offset="4484731">The disfavored purchaser could keep his same price and eat the higher cost, and reduce the profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.268" offset="4520467">Or he could have passed the price increase, the higher cost, along to the customer, in which there's an expectation of lost sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.624" offset="4557874">But this Court has said in Hanover Shoe case and in the Illinois Brisk case that it is insurmountable almost to predict the effect of the higher cost of a product upon, or measure the effect a higher cost will have on the sales of a company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.704" offset="4642197">And therefore, to require proof of an actual loss in sales volume traceable directly to the price discrimination as the only means of proving the fact of damage, flies in the face of what this Court has said is the policy behind enforcing the antitrust laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="3872.986" offset="15643301">--That is the presumption... the presumptive damage rule was in the Senate's version of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3881.342" offset="15676738">It was eliminated in conference due to legislative bargaining without comment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3906.474" offset="15777257">I say that this Court should reaffirm the minimum damage rule that it indicated in Bruce's Juices and in Morton Salt which permits an inference of damage, at least in that amount, subject to rebuttal, and that the mere fact that there was at one point a provision of presumptive damages does not mean that that, the elimination of it by Congress meant that Congress didn't want that type rule, because that rule was redundant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.259" offset="15904421">It was always extant under the Clayton Act, Section 4 of the Clayton Act, as is pointed out in our original brief and reply brief; I think the Ladoga decision permitted it.</text>
