            <text syncTime="43.014" offset="327166">Clayton's action seeks what has been called by this Court in Vaca v. Sipes judicial enforcement of his contractual rights, and to us that means either a hearing... it means a hearing before a tribunal which can either reactivate his grievance or determine his right to reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.443" offset="420894">In the court below both the ITT and UAW asserted as affirmative defenses Clayton's failure to resort to his internal union procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.235" offset="480035">By virtue of an order of trifurcation that issue was tried first and the district court held that the union procedures were adequate to afford him the remedy he sought and dismiss the action against both defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.774" offset="554223">On appeal the dismissal of the claim against the union was affirmed and the dismissal of the claim against the employer was reversed and remanded for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.097" offset="599467">It is true and uncontestable that Clayton did not resort in any way to his internal union procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.545" offset="645338">He was justified in that, we contend, because to have done so would have been an utterly idle act.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.292" offset="676267">The UAW procedures, we submit, were inadequate as a matter of law; they were inadequate in the facts of this case because they could not effect a reactivation of his grievance or his reinstatement; and they were inadequate because they were incapable of rendering a decision within the four-month period allowed in Section 411(a)(4) in the first proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.767" offset="786190">First, as to our position that the union procedure was inadequate as a matter of law, we rely first upon principles enunciated by this Court in NLRB v. Marine Shipbuilding Workers to the effect that where the employee's complaint raises matters in the public domain and go beyond internal union procedures, the union procedures cannot be used to delay his resort to the court, to the National Labor Relations Board, for vindication of his rights under Section 8(b)(1)(a) of the amended National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.110" offset="939581">Here, too, Clayton asserts rights in the public domain, his right to fair representation, the union's duty fairly to represent him, a duty as developed by judicial interpretation and application of Section 9(a) of the amended National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.960" offset="1018993">And we think that the rights involved stand on the same footing as the rights involved in NLRB against the Marine Shipbuilders.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.676" offset="1053788">The principle that I have just tried to enunciate or elaborate was applied by the 9th Circuit in Bise v. the I.B.E.W. with a similar result.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.156" offset="1103734">But perhaps more fundamental than this and going to the competence of the union tribunal is the fact that we deal here with rights governed by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.072" offset="1159427">This Court has enunciated in a number of cases... Vaca v. Sipes, and Motorcoach Employees v. Lockridge, the automobile case, the name of it escapes me for a moment... Humphrey v. Moore... that there's a duty of fair representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.142" offset="1235705">The claim of the breach of that duty is part and parcel of the Section 301 action, and it is controlled by federal law, and the last formulation of that in the Lockridge case was to the effect that whether the proof established the requisites of the breach of duty is a matter of federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="436.374" offset="1900574">Oh, excuse me, they were in Humphrey v. Moore, but in Steele I'm not sure.</text>

            <text syncTime="444.715" offset="1934010">But what I want to emphasize in response to Mr. Justice Stewart is that the claim of breach of the duty of fair representation is coupled with the claim of breach of the collective agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.224" offset="1988032">And the employee is allowed to sue the employer in court, thus not being involved in the arbitration proceeding, only by virtue as proof that the union has breached its duty to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.844" offset="2042471">So I say that if we deal here with matters of federal law under Section 301 both with reference to the claim of the breach of duty and the claim of breach of the collective agreement, we deal with matters which are entrusted to the courts under Section 301, the statute explicitly to this effect, and only the courts can interpret and apply that law; the UAW tribunals are not competent to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.738" offset="2170053">And for the courts to delegate, if you will, that responsibility to the courts would be a violation of the principles of Lincoln Mills, and therefore I say that for all of these reasons that this UAW procedure was inadequate as a matter of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="534.476" offset="2293037">Well, it's conditioned upon proof that the Union breached its duties, and this Court has held that the employees may sue the employer alone and prove in that action the union's breach of duty, and therefore establish his right to go ahead on the merits of his breach of the collective agreement claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.046" offset="2371300">Now, when we get to damages we have another problem and as the Court said in Vaca v. Sipes, the union's liability to the employee in these cases is only for the increases, if any, and the pecuniary damage done to the employee by reason of the union's conduct, but the union cannot be held liable on damages for the damages caused by the employer's conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.739" offset="2466072">And so the doctrine of comparative fault, if you will, is established in Vaca so as to involve an appointment of the damages as between the employer and the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="3620.429" offset="14636835">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.414" offset="14644776">Mr. Justice Stevens, as I understand it, the duty to exhaust is a requirement which derives from the first proviso of 411(a)(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.488" offset="14685109">But whether the requirement will be imposed is a matter of judicial discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.236" offset="14700051">In the trial court that requirement was imposed on the ground that the union remedy could afford this man money as a complete answer to his entire problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.824" offset="14750415">And we take the position, I think it's correct, and it follows the policy laid down in Chambers and other cases which we cite, that he may not be required to resort to a remedy that cannot give him the relief he seeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.476" offset="14800988">And to require him to take money in place of what I concede to be a unique job is certainly to deny him the relief he seeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.113" offset="14835574">This man had 8-1/2 years' seniority; he was a black worker, in a market area where the black rate of unemployment is twice that of whites, and he's thrown out and lost his 8-1/2 years and he can never regain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.311" offset="14880400">He has to have, it seems to me, a right to get at reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.934" offset="14898895">Now, so far, Mr. Chief Justice, as the tradition of exhausting all of these things before resort to court is concerned, I submit to you that exhaustion cannot be imposed arbitrarily and as an empty procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.663" offset="14957827">What can he get out of going to the store manager, as Mr. Whitman put it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.880" offset="14974650">He can get from the store manager at best an admission that the store manager was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.566" offset="14989383">And what does that get him?</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.159" offset="14995757">It gets him possibly damages from the union sometime, after the liability of the employer is decided, but he still has to go to court to get his reinstatement rights determined.</text>

            <text syncTime="3822.442" offset="15444854">The union president, Mr. Fraser, has unfettered discretion to take a case over and decide it himself whenever he thinks it's appropriate, and he is under no time restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.735" offset="15486023">The top level, the Public Review Board of the Constitutional Committee is under no time restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3838.935" offset="15510892">And in that connection, Mr. Justice Brennan, I'd point out to you that the counsel for the PRB has said that this appeal structure is designed to produce an effective decision in approximately nine months to approximately 12 months.</text>

            <text syncTime="3862.550" offset="15605351">In Ruzicka, which is cited very much in my opponent's brief, the employee had gone 27 months fruitlessly without a remedy under the UAW procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3873.936" offset="15650908">And in the Maxwell case we cite to you, the employee had gone 17 months fruitlessly without a remedy.</text>
