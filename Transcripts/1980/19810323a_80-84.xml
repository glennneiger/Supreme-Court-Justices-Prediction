            <text syncTime="192.773" offset="916506">These actions may be brought in either the federal courts or the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.208" offset="930299">But most jurisdictions have state laws which provide that even time barred counter-claims for contracts entered into for more than a year prior to the date on which the action was filed can be brought as counter-claims and are revived.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.769" offset="1000516">So that any defaulting creditor, rather, any defaulting debtor who is sued by a creditor to collect a deficiency judgment on an amount owed on a car who may have entered into his contract four or five years ago could bring a $1000 plus attorneys fees counter-claim, or action for recoupment under most jurisdictions and that would be greater, in most cases, than the deficiencies in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.808" offset="1124650">Now the Respondents in this case estimate that Ford Motor Credit Company alone repossesses 10,000 cars per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.728" offset="1152340">The industry of course, repossesses and has to bring deficiency actions in a far greater number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.733" offset="1184314">The fact that this is the industries' form contract presents a very great problem for the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.471" offset="1211272">The facts of this particular case are that the Respondents purchase and financed the purchase of a used car in 1977 from Anderson Bros. Ford.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.462" offset="1263308">Almost immediately they were disenchanted with their purchase because of mechanical difficulties and sought to rescind the transaction after unsuccessfully pursuing certain state consumer complaint remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.789" offset="1312627">Those were unsuccessful, but they... the Respondents did file this Truth-in-Lending action, alleging five separate truth-in-lending violations in this form.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.846" offset="1360797">In an opinion rendered on October 31, 1978, the trial court dismissed entirely those truth-in-lending allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.118" offset="1401861">In particular, it dismissed the allegation as to the claim that the assignment on the back of the contract which was an assignment of physical damage in unearned insurance premiums by the debtor to the creditor was a security interest, that was the allegation, and that was one of the five allegations which was entirely dismissed by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.119" offset="1505933">As to this particular allegation that the assignment was a security interest that should have been not disclosed on the back but on the front of the contract under the Truth-in-Lending Act, but the District Court looked at the normal meaning of the term security interest in the Act, and looked at the usual and customary meaning of those words as used in the contract, and found that there was no security interest here in the assignment of unearned physical damage insurance premiums, appearing on the back of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.991" offset="1633411">And therefore, no requirement that that appear on the front of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.775" offset="1648562">Now, developments occurred in the Fifth Circuit where the Fifth Circuit rendered an opinion contrary to that which we called to the attention of the District Court and he reversed his position, eventually that reversal against finding the violation of the Truth-in-Lending Act as to this assignment clause was affirmed by the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.206" offset="1730273">There are four uncontrovertible elements which stand as walls that surround the issues in this case, and we respectfully submit that the Court's decision will be made somewhere within the confines of those four walls.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.116" offset="1793907">They are: the true nature of the interest, the assignment interest that is before this Court; the purpose of the Act and the specific legislative history of adoption of the Act's security interest provision; the promulgation by the Federal Reserve Board staff in 1981, of...

            <text syncTime="575.455" offset="2447282">The 1970 regulation, which doesn't seem to be mentioned in the 1981 promulgation, simply, at the end, says in the event of the customers default, your client would have the right to cancel the policy and apply any premium refund to the unpaid balance of the loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.570" offset="2535680">Under the circumstances, we think it would be appropriate to disclose the loan company's ownership of the policy as a type of interest under 12 C.F.R. Section so-and-so.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.295" offset="2586567">I had some trouble with that, originally, because it didn't seem to me to state flatly it must be disclosed, the words it is appropriate to disclose it simply said may be in an excess of caution... but I was also troubled by the fact that the 1981 promulgation, the new regulation which goes in exactly the opposite direction, didn't seem to refer to the 1970 regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="758.991" offset="3181427">Clearly, the Federal Reserve Board under the Court's opinion in Milhollin had the authority to clear up this matter once and for all, and tell the credit community which is only looking for direction in such matters, and will follow that direction from a central authority... which Your Honors found in Milhollin was the Federal Reserve Board clearly, and its power was to enforce, apply and interpret the Act and the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.559" offset="3291664">That... what the Board has referred to as a deferral of final action, and not a withdrawal at all, came only after this Court granted certiorari in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.632" offset="3335967">And in light of the fact that the 172 prior official staff interpretations of the Federal Reserve Board have been adopted without any substantive change, as we indicated in Appendix B to our reply brief, is a factor that the Court ought to consider, because these things were not promulgated as trial balloons, as counsel for the Respondents has argued, but rather as seriously well considered and thoroughly thought-through determinations by the Federal Reserve Board as to interpreting the Act that governs the framework of, in determining commerce and credit in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.149" offset="3533976">Indeed, although 173 is only a proposed agency interpretation, the Courts have held applying this Court's Skidmore v. Swift decision, that even a proposed agency interpretation is entitled to such persuasive weight as is evidenced from such things as the thoroughness of its consideration and the validity of its reasoning.</text>

            <text syncTime="2267.791" offset="9216549">I would note that the Federal Reserve Board has issued a series of rulings which have required disclosure of a wide range of security interests, security interests which do not fit into Ford Credit's characterization of essential security interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.384" offset="9278929">The Federal Reserve Board, in their rulings set out at page 9 of our brief, have required disclosure of security interests in bank accounts, credit union accounts, and after acquired property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.358" offset="9322815">The test is not whether the security interest is essential, but whether... but merely that any security interest be required to be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.695" offset="9356252">The Regulation Z definition, as I indicated, is any interest in property which secures payment or performance of an obligation and thus a two-pronged test is set up by Regulation Z and every Court which has applied that test to the issue in this case has concluded that a creditor's claim to returned insurance premiums is a security interest under the Truth-in-Lending Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.961" offset="9441306">Although the first test, the first prong of the Regulation Z definition, is any interest in property, Ford Credit attempts to downplay the significance of the interest in property it has retained in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.435" offset="9491148">It argues that this is an identical interest and therefore need not be disclosed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3213.399" offset="12998975">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.940" offset="12998870">The purpose of the clause that we've been discussing today is not to gain access to incidental... unearned security interests, but rather to keep the real security interests in these transactions not only for Ford Credit but for the industry insured... and that is, to maintain insurance on the financed vehicles themselves which are the real security interests in the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.540" offset="12998766">We do not only rely upon Senator Garn who is a member of the committee that adopted the Simplification Act, but also the Federal Reserve Board that held that the Simplification Act clarifies this issue as intended by the original Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.467" offset="12998661">Finally, with respect to this matter, creditors are only looking for clear direction from the Federal Reserve Board which has stated that clear direction in 173, and but for this Court's grant of certiorari that would be the law today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.828" offset="12998557">Respondent should not be permitted to embrace the Federal Reserve Board's decision while at the same time ignoring 173.</text>
