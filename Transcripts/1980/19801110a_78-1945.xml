            <label>Mr. Robert E. Mann</label>
            <text syncTime="50.340" offset="349541">Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="53.791" offset="363333">The issue before the Court in this case is whether under the Davis-Bacon Act a federal court would have jurisdiction to revise a public contract upon suit by a private party against a private contractor without regard to the actions or inactions of the agency party to the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.658" offset="454762">The case arises at the Fermi National Accelerator Lab near Batavia, Illinois, which is a high energy physics research establishment housing the world's largest proton accelerator.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.403" offset="501782">The petitioner is an association of universities which has entered into a contract with the Federal Government, originally through the Atomic Energy Commission, and more recently with the Department of Energy, to manage the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.099" offset="564581">All funds for the construction and management of the Laboratory are supplied by the Federal Government through provisions in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.751" offset="607108">The petitioner's role is that of manager, to supervise construction, to supervise the operation, and to supervise the maintenance of the facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.935" offset="643889">To carry out its responsibilities, the petitioner association is authorized by the Government to hire individuals to work in various categories, such as physicist, engineer, technician, clerical person, et cetera, and all funds for the compensation of those persons are provided by the Federal Government in accordance with the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.612" offset="730615">There are rate schedules attached to the contract which have been agreed to by the Government as appropriate for payment of the individuals employed by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.296" offset="773351">The claimant in this case maintains that notwithstanding his employment as an electronics technician, that is, one assigned to monitor computers, operate accelerators, and assist in research functions, he should have been paid at area electrician construction rates pursuant to the Davis-Bacon Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.178" offset="848898">The contract specifically provides that the parties did not contemplate performance of construction work by persons employed by the Association, and therefore there are no Davis-Bacon Act stipulations in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.141" offset="912741">The Federal District Court issued two rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.234" offset="929041">The first ruling held that in the absence of an express Davis-Bacon Act provision in the contract there could be no right of recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.949" offset="959970">The case was left open for purposes of allowing the plaintiff to show if he could that the Government had made separate determinations regarding his work as being construction in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.959" offset="1007931">After the taking of a number of depositions, other discovery, Freedom of Information Act requests, the plaintiff was forced to conclude that he could show no prior agency determination that his work was in fact covered by the Davis-Bacon Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.500" offset="1074178">Consequently, the Federal District Court granted a motion for summary judgment upon that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.342" offset="1097479">The Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.810" offset="1107405">The Court of Appeals, in effect, held that regardless of the express inclusion of Davis-Bacon Act provisions in this contract, they were included as a matter of law and that the Federal District Court would have authority in effect to substitute its judgment for that of the agency regarding the construction nature of the plaintiff's work, to set an appropriate wage scale, and to set up an appropriate classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.860" offset="1215552">In doing so it extrapolated from its 1977 McDaniel case in which it held that there was an implied right of action to enforce express contract terms setting forth Davis-Bacon Act requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.479" offset="1274067">We would ask the Court to focus on the fact that this is not a proceeding arising under the Administrative Procedure Act challenging agency action.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.444" offset="1313877">It is not a proceeding arising under a contract action based upon express contract commitments.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.160" offset="1340731">Our petitioner here has never entered into a contract agreeing to pay Davis-Bacon Act rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.486" offset="1362047">It is not an action to enforce a self-enforcing statute, such as an equal opportunity clause, which is directed to the beneficiary party without regard to Government actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.496" offset="1418158">This is an action which attempts to maintain a private cause of action to secure a judicial determination as to coverage of the Davis-Bacon Act, application of particular wages and classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.287" offset="1473329">The effect is to substitute the federal courts for the agencies' contracting officers regarding these matters of coverage, classification, and rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.814" offset="1515438">Not only that, the action is brought against a not-for-profit entity which does not stand to gain or lose, depending on what rates are paid to the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.763" offset="1559219">And it is brought after the contract has already been performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.824" offset="1579386">It is not being brought in anticipation of the contract, as some recent cases have been brought, but after the contract was performed the Federal District Court was asked to revise the contract to include specific Davis-Bacon Act provisions and to hold the defendant not-for-profit contractor liable without regard to the agency action that it had contracted with.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.923" offset="1671859">As the Court undoubtedly knows, the Davis-Bacon Act emerged along with other pieces of legislation in the same legislative era of the '30s, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Walsh-Healey Act, and of course the Davis-Bacon Act and other provisions requiring the payment of wages at certain levels in order to rectify conditions that had resulted from the Depression.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.821" offset="1767467">There are significant differences, however, between the Davis Bacon-Act and the Walsh-Healey Act, on the one hand, and the Fair Labor Standards Act on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.645" offset="1806756">The same Congress that enacted these statutes provided that the Davis-Bacon Act and Walsh-Healey Act policies would be enforced through the vehicle of contract, and not only through the vehicle of contract but through the vehicle of administrative pre-determination of what the obligations would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.138" offset="1880734">Conversely, in the Fair Labor Standards Act the universal minimum wage and hours of work standard was set and the parties affected by that were expressly given the right to file suit to enforce their rights independently of the Government to secure their wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.834" offset="1955445">Congress was concerned about the social goal that it had, that is, to make sure that local wage and labor markets were not disrupted, but also was concerned about maintaining efficiency in government contracting.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.281" offset="2017302">And so it struck a balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.469" offset="2022005">It struck a balance in the Davis-Bacon Act, and the fulcrum of that balance is the concept of predetermination, so that before the contract is gone into and executed, all parties know what their obligations are and no one can be heard to complain if the obligations prove too onerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.352" offset="2093580">What we have here is an attempt by the Court of Appeals and the respondents to upset that fulcrum, to establish a principle whereby the federal courts after the contract has been executed, notwithstanding the predetermination concept, are in a position to go back and determine that something should have been paid at a different rate than it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.610" offset="2178530">The concept of predetermination, which is embedded in the Davis-Bacon Act, was a topic of the legislative amendments to that Act in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.510" offset="2218132">Prior to 1935 there was no provision for predetermination.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.509" offset="2234223">In 1935, after a four-year history of some confusion in applying the law, Congress expressly amended it to provide for predetermination, so that the contract would carry the obligations and not some implied obligations based upon a post-analysis of the work.</text>

            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="539.768" offset="2307157">Mr. Mann, could I just be sure I understand your position.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.048" offset="2320323">Assume here there had been a predetermination that some part of the construction work on the laboratory would be covered by Davis-Bacon.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.092" offset="2352506">And the laboratory did not pay those... and it was performed by their own people.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.651" offset="2370791">And supposing an employee didn't know about that till the contract was performed and then he had gotten less than the Davis-Bacon Act provided, would he have in your view of the law, have a private cause of action against your client for the difference between what he was paid and what he actually should have been paid?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert E. Mann</label>
            <text syncTime="573.363" offset="2441636">We have taken the position on that question, Mr. Justice Stevens, that there is under the Act no private right of action at all, even to recover under express provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.717" offset="2495030">There may be a right of action in a state court, under a state common law theory of third-party beneficiary, but not in federal court, because there's no real federal question there; it's a contract question involved there.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.978" offset="2540065">So we've taken the position that even if there were an express contract that there would not be a private right to go to court.</text>

            <text syncTime="626.701" offset="2654899">That is, we didn't really address the issue whether in general there is a private right to enforce a specific clause, but whether there is a private right to obtain the court determination of the fundamental issues of coverage, of classification of rate, that was the issue presented to the trial court, and the trial court held that it did not have jurisdiction under the Davis-Bacon Act to in effect substitute its judgment for the contracting officer's judgment, at least without having had some effort by the contracting officer to be involved, some appeal to him, some--</text>

            <text syncTime="658.611" offset="2782586">Well, I understand the distinction between predetermination and postdetermination, but it seems to me that's quite a different question than the question whether there is a private cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.687" offset="2818844">And it seemed to me in your brief the issue was rather clear, that you basically were arguing about whether they decided in advance of performance of the contract there was any Davis-Bacon Act work and you said, no, and that's the end of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.479" offset="2862102">That doesn't require us to think at all about private cause of action, as I see it.</text>

            <text syncTime="729.910" offset="3067738">I believe there have been Comptroller General decisions and perhaps some Court of Claims decisions which say that the Government does not have as a matter of right the right to come in and amend its determination, and yet still hold the contractor unequivocally liable as though the amendment had occurred at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.607" offset="3146524">But I believe that the concept of predetermination is flexible enough to permit the agency itself, upon its own motion or upon the appeal of some party to--</text>

            <label>Ms. Harriet S. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="941.850" offset="3915569">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="950.643" offset="3950677">This is a suit against a federal contractor based solely on the Davis-Bacon Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.750" offset="3971157">It's not a suit to review agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.763" offset="3991219">An Administrative Procedure Act suit would raise different issues between different parties and require the consideration of different fundamental legislative policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.384" offset="4033642">I want to emphasize that neither my brief nor my remarks today deal with the issues or the policies that would have to be considered in an Administrative Procedure Act suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.020" offset="4080245">We've taken no position on those issues and I'm not authorized to speak for the government concerning them.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.455" offset="4105949">The question here is only whether the contractor employee has a right to relief against the contractor in an implied private cause of action under the Davis-Bacon Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.529" offset="4150253">We have discussed in our brief the reason why we believe that under the Cort v. Ash test there is no such implied cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.510" offset="4182227">And we have emphasized there the indications of legislative intent as the recent decisions of this Court require.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.351" offset="4217544">This morning, however, I would like to focus on the third Cort v. Ash factor, and discuss briefly why we believe that the implication of a private cause of action is not necessary to the accomplishment of the legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.516" offset="4278253">That purpose was to assure the payment of prevailing wages by government construction contractors without disrupting the federal procurement process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.716" offset="4315033">The express remedies provided are the result of the congressional balancing of these potentially competing federal interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.744" offset="4347111">The remedies are designed to protect the laborer's wages without interfering unduly with efficient procurement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.116" offset="4380653">That congressional balancing was originally made in the 1930s when government procurement contracts were far simpler than the one before the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.531" offset="4426210">Today the Act still covers the traditional brick-and-mortar contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.576" offset="4446481">It also covers contracts for construction that is necessary for the highly technical federal programs at the Department of Energy as well as at NASA and the Defense Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.338" offset="4493502">These two types of contracts are in many ways quite different in terms both of the need of the laborers for the additional protections that a private cause of action would afford, and of the potential of such a cause of action for disrupting procurement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.926" offset="4559853">These differences simply highlight the importance of maintaining the balance Congress struck in an earlier day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.485" offset="4586080">Mr. Mann has described briefly how the Fermilab is run under the prime contract at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.372" offset="4617636">That operation is typical of many large, long-term federal contracts for work at the frontiers of science and technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.447" offset="4653893">I want to add to his description only the statement... at the Fermilab the Davis-Bacon decisions are made by a committee composed of agency experts and if the decisions that the private work projects are submitted to the committee, the committee makes a recommendation as to whether the project involves Davis-Bacon work or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.042" offset="4796313">If the committee recommends to the manager and the contracting officer that Davis-Bacon work is involved, that work is subcontracted out to a contractor who works under the Davis-Bacon Act, with the Davis-Bacon clauses in his contract, using building trades union employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.017" offset="4892235">The operation of this system is monitored.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.919" offset="4919820">The agency has extensive reviews to make sure that the contracts for construction work include the Davis-Bacon clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.901" offset="4951689">It also conducts enforcement investigations at the site to make sure that the work is performed as required by the contract and consistently with the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1557.821" offset="6379438">My final point is that at least in the particular situation that we have here, there are significant nonjudicial methods for the laborer to assure, to be sure that the agency is not acting in an arbitrary manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.357" offset="6489570">These controls are non-judicial but the fact is that the construction trades are highly unionized, since all Davis-Bacon work is required to be performed by subcontract, those unions have a real interest in policing the agencies' implementation of the Act, so that their employers get as much of the total work at the projects as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.426" offset="6589880">And they have ample means of assuring that the agency will consider their view seriously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.970" offset="6612032">These basically are, negotiation locally in Washington with the procuring agency, and through consultation with the Department of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.401" offset="6673786">In short, particularly in the context of contracts like this one, the Davis-Bacon Act is effectively enforced through negotiations between union and agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="2082.191" offset="8476862">Representative Goodell in his attempt to place an amendment in the Act, which did not pass, sought to open up the entire area of judicial review concerning all aspects of the Act, at least according to his proposed bill, his proposed amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.697" offset="8570902">However, other statements by legislators, for example, Representative Fogarty and others, and Representative Goodell himself, recognized that the basic purpose of that proposed amendment by that Representative, was to render the Secretary of Labor's predeterminations of prevailing wages, what the prevailing wages in a community are, subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.529" offset="8678213">And because the Congress has always determined that that question should not be open to judicial review as well as for other nongermane reasons, Congress did not adopt that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.991" offset="8752088">Congress did not, therefore, open up the question of predeterminations of wage rates, what they are in a community, to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.816" offset="8787405">But the question of predetermination of anything else has never been an issue in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.797" offset="8819275">That has never been placed in the hands of any government agency, one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.810" offset="8843412">Counsel attempts to use the word predetermination in a very broad way, and the Davis-Bacon Act is a very simple statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.261" offset="8877162">It says that the Secretary of Labor shall make predeterminations of wage rates, and he does, and they are published in the Federal Register for each county and metropolitan area around the country, and that's all that he is supposed to predetermine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.861" offset="8951559">Now, what the petitioner seeks to say, that there should be and must be, in order for the Davis-Bacon Act to work, there must be a predetermination by a government agency that a contract is a construction contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.810" offset="9019373">Well, the Solicitor of Labor in his testimony in 1962, among others, has said that when Congress enacted the Davis-Bacon Act in 1931 and amended it substantially in 1935, Congress did not use the words</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.722" offset="9091053">"construction, alteration, or repair, including painting and decorating. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.907" offset="9115817">to mean something special, or something that is placed in the hands of some technicians at some government agency, or something difficult of interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.732" offset="9159076">The Solicitor of Labor at that time and all of the authorities who have referred to it have talked about the fact that Congress meant the ordinary meaning of those words, and courts can make those determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.474" offset="9222083">We have cited the recent Cortelyou of one of our circuits in which the Court held specifically, very recently, that the work that was before it clearly was pursuant to a contract calling for</text>

            <text syncTime="2290.123" offset="9308600">Now, I have asserted in my brief that the right of action question was never briefed, argued, or whatever, before the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.087" offset="9360532">This summary judgment matter arose when the petitioner filed a motion for summary judgment, and discovery at that time, by the way, was stayed to permit the court to rule on that legal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.097" offset="9412568">That summary judgment motion was supported by an affidavit of petitioner's counsel saying,</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.578" offset="9446422">"No Davis-Bacon Act stipulations have been included within or are incorporated within the government contract here in question. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2338.260" offset="9501175">But that's the issue, that's the issue that was raised before the trial court, that is the... this contract does not contain Davis-Bacon Act stipulations, that was the issue raised before the trial court and that was the issue argued and dealt with in the 7th Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.440" offset="9573900">There was no right of action issue at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.846" offset="9583513">And the 7th Circuit said, and I respectfully submit, correctly... and indeed it must be so held... that a statute that is a mandatory statute, a statute that says that certain things shall occur is incorporated by operation of law if it is not within a contract in itself, or if it is there by reference if it is referred to by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.177" offset="9692809">And I submit to this Court also, that the Davis-Bacon Act is expressly within our contract, notwithstanding the summary judgment granted by the trial court, because among other things this is... the fact that Davis-Bacon was referred to in correspondence between the AEC at that time and our petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.996" offset="9792075">The requirement on the petitioner is that such construction work which is called for by this contract would be subcontracted to subcontractors with the petitioner having the obligation to make sure that Davis-Bacon stipulations were included in all those subcontracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.143" offset="9880682">And there was the further agreement between them by memorandum which we were able to discover... by the way, through Freedom of Information Act procedures, not through the discovery that we were able to get by that time... there was the further memorandum of understanding that if the petitioner does any of this work with its own employees... that's our case... its own employees, then the contract will be modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.898" offset="9987680">The general contract, this prime contract, will be modified to require that the petitioner pay its own employees the prevailing wages required by the Davis-Bacon Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.987" offset="10032088">How can anybody say that the Davis-Bacon Act is not express in that contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.626" offset="10050687">And even if it isn't, even if we were to say that the Davis-Bacon Act is not referred to in that contract and that they are not bound by express contract, they are certainly bound by the principle that mandatory statutes which affect government contracts are in those contracts by operation of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2727.214" offset="11057028">And that is one of the powers exercised by Congress in enacting the Davis-Bacon Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.257" offset="11077195">That is the jurisdictional prerequisite, the right of action is referred to by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.816" offset="11111363">To the extent that this Court elects to determine the question of the existence of a right of action, I should point out that I'm not asking this Court nor have I ever asked that this Court or any court in this case consider that there is an alternative private remedy to an employee which he can voluntarily use and disregard any other private remedy that Congress may have given him, such as that one under Section 3(b), talking about the right of action against the contractor and his sureties, which Congress has given to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.721" offset="11279069">I have not said that a wage earner has the right to disregard express remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.843" offset="11307490">I have said, if an alternative is required, if that statute, if that section is interpreted as meaning only action under some payment bond, then there must be... since Congress intended... a right of these individuals to recover their unpaid wages, for these individuals to have a right of action directly against the contractor, but only if the original statutory remedies are unavailable, and ineffective in the ways that they are in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.062" offset="11456388">Now, I should be very frank with this Court to point out that there is nothing in the record thus far to demonstrate that the remedies are unavailable or ineffective in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.480" offset="11506021">That was shown in the McDaniel case because that was in issue, and we presented affidavits below in the trial court demonstrating that the employer... that was University of Chicago operating Argonne National Lab... had not furnished the necessary surety payment bond and that the Comptroller General had not withheld certain payments in order to pay employees, as well as a couple of other miscellaneous items like blacklisting, which of course would not be done in this kind of an instance, and one other minor administrative item.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.041" offset="11664323">There we made our record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.509" offset="11678220">Here we never had a record, had an opportunity to make the record concerning the unavailability or ineffectiveness of this right of action, if it is so interpreted, if it is so limited to action only on a surety bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.675" offset="11742795">Here we have to... if the Court is going to rule on this question of the existence of a right of action, this Court must in order to be fair presume that the situation is as it was in McDaniel, and which we have no reason to doubt in this case that the situation was the same, that our Petitioner has not submitted Miller Act bonds or any other kind of surety payment bond that the employee can proceed upon, and that the Comptroller General has not withheld sums to assure payment to these laborers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.365" offset="11869645">Certainly this Court, unless it makes that presumption cannot rule appropriately on my opponent's suggestion that there is no right of action existing under circumstances such as these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.981" offset="11948013">I am not... and I make this clear again...
