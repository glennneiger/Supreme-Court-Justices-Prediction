            <text syncTime="234.432" offset="1084297">More importantly there is no due process right to discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.320" offset="1103837">Discovery is necessarily a matter of state procedural law.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.188" offset="1115331">Consequently, it's... what is discoverable today may not be discoverable tomorrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.592" offset="1136960">In fact, Kentucky at the present time is going through a revision of its discovery rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.127" offset="1155037">And we feel for those reasons discovery is constitutionally inadequate to achieve a reliable identification.</text>

            <text syncTime="1851.245" offset="7551484">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.964" offset="7566426">The Sixth Amendment right to counsel does not mandate an in camera determination of the admissibility of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.736" offset="7605506">What Plaintiff, or Petitioner, is asking here is basically that because of Wade, and a series of identification cases, that they have the right, constitutionally, to determine the admissibility of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.133" offset="7679066">We have used the phrase "reliability" today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.418" offset="7692232">Reliability is used to denote two separate things: first, the admissibility of evidence, and second, the credibility of the witness in presenting that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.059" offset="7738835">One is a function of the trial court, the other is a function of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.963" offset="7766420">The right to counsel is predicated upon an inherent fairness in our system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.002" offset="7806544">It's to remove the inequality of the adversarial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.806" offset="7825770">Wade, the man was unable to cope with what the government was doing at that point in time without counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.745" offset="7857535">This damage to him could not be cured later, with cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.101" offset="7894942">The practical aspects which this Court has indicated through its questioning are just beyond belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.272" offset="7923677">The phrase "nuts and bolts of justice", I submit we're going to have a lot more bolts than we are nuts to go on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.028" offset="7958681">The process of the brother identification; what about an eyewitness as to a physical object such as an automobile?</text>

            <text syncTime="1964.268" offset="8003612">All the practical aspects that we're talking about, just because defense counsel would like to cross examine and determine out of the hearing of the jury, whether or not he wants to ask questions in front of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.547" offset="8076755">Those which are beneficial to him he will ask.</text>

            <text syncTime="2103.809" offset="8561796">Upon the judge declaring that evidence inadmissible, it would be no different than him declaring hearsay inadmissible, or any other evidence inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.717" offset="8609444">Trial counsel, defense counsel, at that point in time, asks for an admonition, if not given sua sponte, and in addition, he may ask for a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.941" offset="8646328">Admittedly, the prosecutor runs the burden, or runs the risk that if his identification is inadmissible everything is going to go down the tubes at that point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.999" offset="8698573">But assuming... going on with your hypothetical, that the trial court denies the motion for mistrial, we still have the appellate review of due process, the fundamental unfairness aspect; it does not require a per se constitutional requirement that we determine all these factors prior to trial.</text>
