            <text syncTime="86.512" offset="479011">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="90.965" offset="496878">This is a challenge to a Montana tax based on the Commerce Clause and the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.445" offset="534808">The tax was enacted in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.083" offset="549332">Prior to 1975 there was an array of taxes in Montana, including a net proceeds tax, a property tax, license tax, and a severance tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.297" offset="598129">In addition, the state received royalties from the Federal Government to cover the impact of mining coal in Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.840" offset="632402">And the coal companies... mindful of the problems they had with Anaconda Copper and earlier, provided that the coal companies had to reclaim the land as they mined and they had to post substantial bonds to guarantee that the land would be properly reclaimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.018" offset="717038">So presumably, the taxes on the books at that time were sufficient to meet the cost of the services provided by Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.813" offset="752252">In fact... and I point out that this tax was a 1975 tax... in 1973 the severance tax had been increased from 10 cents a ton, based on BTU, to approximately 34 cents a ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.586" offset="827380">Shortly thereafter, the Arab oil embargo occurred and it became clear that the nation was facing a very serious energy crisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.457" offset="878789">So Montana saw an opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.471" offset="890909">Montana has more than 25 percent of the coal reserves in the United States and it started to plan how it could maximize its taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.841" offset="932392">The spirit in which it was done was exemplified by one of its sponsors in the House of Representatives when he said, the Arabs have the oil but we have the coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.836" offset="980353">Most of this coal is shipped out of the state; 90 percent of it, in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.600" offset="1007416">And the coal is leased under long-term contracts, so the discussion in the Legislature for the most part involved the question, how much would the market xx?</text>
            <text syncTime="234.404" offset="1070632">The Legislature was advised that the amount of the tax would not be subject to any judicial review.</text>

            <text syncTime="304.800" offset="1352232">We said that we could not imagine that a tax, that a severance tax of 12-1/2 percent would ever be more than enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.011" offset="1417016">We think that probably in this case a tax... well, my studies show that no matter how they figured the cost of the services that might be necessary to provide for additional mining of coal, that it could never amount to more than 10 cents a ton additional.</text>

            <text syncTime="388.312" offset="1686286">Now, we say, under these circumstances, because it's a tailored tax and because it falls to a large extent... 90 percent of the tax is paid for by people in other states... that we are entitled to a trial to show that by no stretch of the imagination can Montana show that they need this money for the services that are provided by Montana.</text>

            <text syncTime="527.411" offset="2242589">Let me just read what the Senator said who proposed the tax, if I can find it.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.345" offset="2278325">But anyway, he pointed out that... and this is in the legislative history, that this tax was going to be paid for initially by the coal companies but because of the contracts it would be immediately paid for by the utilities, who in turn under the law passed that on to the customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.414" offset="2370694">So, the tax is being paid for by the customers in Chicago, in Detroit, Minneapolis, and other cities and towns.</text>

            <text syncTime="1295.965" offset="5316888">I'd like to focus the Court's attention today on the actual allegations that the appellants declared in their complaint because there have been a lot of facts bandied about both in the briefs and suggested today by counsel for the appellants as to what the allegations were and what kind of facts the appellants could prove if they'd gone to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.736" offset="5419915">First of all, I think it's important to note that basically under the Commerce Clause the appellants have alleged that the mined coal in Montana is destined for outside the state, that the coal is taxed at 20 to 30 percent of the value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.809" offset="5476235">Actually the effective rate of the tax is 22 percent, since the production costs, the taxes on production costs are backed out before the severance tax applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.524" offset="5511135">And thirdly, they've alleged that the revenues that are anticipated by Montana in the fiscal years '78 and '79 are $34 and $40 million respectively for all coal, not just the coal that they're mining, but for all coal that will be mined in Montana in those years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.252" offset="5574038">And then they say, therefore, that our tax is not fairly related to the services and protections provided by the State of Montana, but in their briefs and today in oral argument we hear that Montana's legitimate needs have already been met, and we hear that the local impact costs from appellants' activities only amount to two cents a ton whereas our tax amounts to $2 or more a ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.399" offset="5674557">And we also hear that the tax bears no relationship to the legitimate needs of the people of the State of Montana.</text>

            <text syncTime="1483.342" offset="6066394">I think the constitutional challenge to that type of a tax would be the same that we have on other areas, whether there is a due process question or whether there was a Commerce Clause, possibly a Commerce Clause question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.026" offset="6113101">I think the fact that the Legislature decides to have one tax is not by itself significant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1564.856" offset="6392402">And my hypothetical is an extreme one but they are relieved of all taxes because of the windfall they would get out of taxing one particular industry or one particular category of taxpayers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2014.504" offset="8190985">For instance, the Court could have intended by that that the states must impose, if they impose taxes they must allow the taxpayers to avail themselves of the services, and the appellants in this case haven't alleged that they don't... that they're not capable of benefiting from the services that Montana provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.058" offset="8261202">Perhaps the Court meant that the tax must somehow be related to the activities of the taxpayer in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.634" offset="8279487">And I think clearly that's the case when you attach the tax to the percentage of the value of the mined coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.303" offset="8310207">Now, I suppose... another thing, they suggested that all the states could meet this test, and I suggest to this Court that that's probably true, because I think most of the state taxes, certainly those that are a severance tax, would meet this kind of a fairly related test and that unless the Court were to find, for instance, that Montana taxed the net federal income of the coal companies as opposed to anything that relates to coal, maybe that wouldn't be related to what the activities were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.337" offset="8442387">But getting back to our main point, the fact is that the fairly related test does not require a balancing of benefits and burdens of providing certain services for the taxpayers other than the ones that they would generally be entitled to by living in the State of Montana.</text>

            <text syncTime="2379.526" offset="9651125">Well, I'll just take a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.011" offset="9657081">I think that this discussion has focused on the issue, and that is whether the Complete Auto test and the Washington Stevedoring test have any meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.660" offset="9699608">It's our position that they do have meaning, and that the Court intended that they have meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.160" offset="9717685">This, it seems to us, is a classic case because we've been denied a trial and the position of Montana and the Solicitor General both is that there is no limit to the tax that Montana may impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.496" offset="9790932">As the Attorney General said today, that they may impose, that they would be entitled constitutionally to impose a tax of 1,000 percent, and in the Montana court it was argued that the tax would be without limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.505" offset="9851014">So, this is a situation where 75 percent of this coal is owned by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.532" offset="9879122">Montana could not impose a tax on that coal without running into the Supremacy Clause, so it has taxed 30 percent allegedly on the severance of the coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.760" offset="9940039">And I think it's admitted by... as Justice Rehnquist pointed out, by the Solicitor General, that Heisler does not apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.164" offset="9969610">The Supreme court of Montana rested its case on Heisler.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.192" offset="9985806">So, we believe that we are entitled to a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.925" offset="10016735">I think the questions that the Chief Justice and Justice Stevens asked were most appropriate because the fact is that because the tax revenues are so great as a result of this tax, that other taxes are being reduced, and as the taxes continue to grow and as this trust fund continues to grow, it already has $200 million, so the interest on... I don't mean the trust fund has; I mean the tax is $200 million, so the trust fund is getting up, $100 million, as as time goes on it will be in the billions, and Montana won't need any other taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.705" offset="10163856">This tax already is amounting to almost, it's approaching 20 percent of the total tax revenues of the state, so it's only a matter of time that there will be no necessity for taxes in Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.967" offset="10216833">And under these circumstances, if Complete Auto means anything... and we think it does... in Washington Stevedoring case the Court pointed out that there was no trial, that the appellants had not made their claim of not-fairly-related.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.756" offset="10292065">So we think the Complete Auto test requires a trial, and in this case, when it was so clearly tailored to fall on taxpayers outside the state, we believe that we are entitled to a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.876" offset="10356536">If the Court should decide in favor of Montana, that we are not entitled to a trial, that means that under these circumstances in the future any state could tax without limit, and I think the without-limit concept would have the effect of balkanizing this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.724" offset="10447860">There are mineral resources and there are timber resources and all kinds of resources, and if each state may tax without limit, disregarding the needs of the nation and that the only remedy will be to go to Congress each time and ask for Congress to preempt the tax, it will be very difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.433" offset="10530720">We don't think that this Court would want to create that type of result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.026" offset="10553081">We believe that after a trial that Montana will realize that this tax is excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.020" offset="10585055">Already the people in Montana... I notice some Senators are saying the tax is excessive, and I think once this Court lays down some general guidelines for the states, that the state legislatures will tend to comply with those guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.858" offset="10644405">We do not suggest that the courts, any courts, set the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.716" offset="10663840">We say the tax should be set by the state legislatures, but they should be fairly related to the services and protection provided to the taxpayer by the state.</text>
