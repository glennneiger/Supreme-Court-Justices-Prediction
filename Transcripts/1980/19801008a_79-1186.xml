            <text syncTime="2276.512" offset="9253289">And the fact that he is immune does not have anything to do with his capacity to conspire; he has full capacity to conspire, he has full capacity to commit any criminal act that any individual has.</text>

            <text syncTime="2597.073" offset="10535588">Well the rationale there is substantially what Mr. Edmonds said; that the fact that... we'll take, simplify it, we've got two parties; the judge and one party, so the one party who bribes the judge finds out that the judge is immune and then you file your conspiracy suit on 1983 and you cannot have a conspiracy with only one party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.107" offset="10647706">So with the judge removed, they say, well, he didn't conspire with any state official against whom we could allege a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.416" offset="10684904">Well, of course, that's a fiction, he conspired with him, and as in this case, the injunction was issued as a result of the bribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.554" offset="10713430">It lasted for 31 months, our client abated... he abated because it had the force of state law, it was state action, it had the color of state law, everything that was required was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.361" offset="10756688">And he abated for 31 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.562" offset="10773511">And the trial that he had was before a judge that was bribed.</text>
