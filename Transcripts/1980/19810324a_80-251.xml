            <text syncTime="3283.992" offset="13285784">Every case, I think, in this Court that has ever cited Schlesinger, and has purported to follow Schlesinger, has emphasized that Schlesinger was a compensatory ameliatory act, that in fact it was uniquely so, because the very men who brought that action were the precise men who had benefited from the assignment differential, which means access to promotion differential, and so that case really is perhaps the archetype of compensatory--</text>

            <text syncTime="3323.400" offset="13443354">The other thing is, of course, Schlesinger was an internal military case, and most importantly, as far as I can see, differentiating it between this case, other than the internal military matter, is that the basis of classification was not simply gender.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.361" offset="13523289">The explicit basis of classification was gender except where the access to the promotions was equal, at which point there was no differentiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.473" offset="13583684">This Court emphasized it, I think, at least three times in Schlesinger, that where men and women, for instance, in the Medical Corps or the Legal Corps... several other corps... had equal access to assignments geared to foster promotions, there was no difference in the time permitted to achieve promotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.053" offset="13669993">And that, I think, is very, very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.088" offset="13678143">The other thing is that historically Schlesinger was not based, even arguably, on stereotypes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.909" offset="13705415">It was demonstrably based upon a recent congressional reconsideration in 1967, in fact, of precisely what was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.515" offset="13739896">They found that there was still a gap in assignability, and there was still a gap, most particularly in how long it was taking men and women to achieve promotions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.073" offset="13786081">And so Congress there did reenact, literally, as opposed to what happened here, major provisions of that entire series of statutes, so there really was congressional consideration there.</text>
