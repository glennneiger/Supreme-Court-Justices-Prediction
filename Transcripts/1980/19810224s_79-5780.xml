            <text syncTime="8.242" offset="124979">This case is here on writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.662" offset="146713">That Court rejected petitioner's effort to obtain writ of habeas corpus in which the petitioner challenged the application of a Florida statute enacted after the day of his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.630" offset="206481">That statute reduced the availability of what's called gain-time for good conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.624" offset="234485">To this gain-time provision, the State rewards each prisoner for good conduct and obedience to prison rules by shortening the portion of his sentence he must serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.352" offset="289446">The new Florida statute reduced the amount of his gain-time for good conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.524" offset="314106">We granted certiorari to consider the petitioner's claim that this reduction violated the constitution ban against ex post facto laws and we hold that the application of Florida's new gain-time statute to petitioner, it does in fact constitute a violation of the ex post facto ban as applied to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.038" offset="412117">The statute alters the consequences of a crime already completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.604" offset="430403">For the reasons stated more fully in an opinion filed today with the clerk, we conclude that Florida's new gain-time provision constricts petitioner's opportunity to earn early release and thus makes the consequence of his crime worse than when the crime occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.748" offset="515040">The judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida is therefore vacated and the case is remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.849" offset="539386">Justice Blackmun has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which the Chief Justice had joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.756" offset="567076">Justice Rehnquist has also filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
