            <text syncTime="1436.142" offset="5893662">There was a final... Dr. Ricks grieved, filed grievance proceedings in May of 1974, and one of the things that he grieved was denial of tenure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.450" offset="5942876">The Grievance Committee reached a final decision on September 12, 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.805" offset="5976313">And our argument there is that this Court has held by your opinion in Electrical Workers that a grievance procedure does not toll the statute under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.582" offset="6043395">And the reasoning there was that the Congress did not provide for such a tolling and there are really two separate actions, the grievance procedure is contractual, Title VII is an Act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.194" offset="6105880">And that's our argument there for saying that the September 12, 1974, date is merely a decision on the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.668" offset="6151751">We feel that the decision is directly contrary to the purpose and intent of the statute of limitations, that if you permit someone to sue when they know they're going to be terminated, finally or when they do leave employment, that that violates the whole purpose and intent of the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.534" offset="6247255">It's very pertinent in this case because the statute is to prevent stale claims, to allow you to have witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1542.495" offset="6319039">The whole intent of Congress in Title VII is to expedite these claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1552.667" offset="6359790">If no agreement is reached by EEOC in the conciliation agreement then the employee may file suit and the district court is asked in the statute to assign a judge to the case and to expedite the case with all due speed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.584" offset="6459369">We think it's also very contrary to practical considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.624" offset="6499598">It leaves the employer in a state of not knowing what's going to happen.</text>

            <text syncTime="1975.272" offset="8050122">He is claiming that, and I think a fair reading of his complaint indicates that he is claiming that his discharge is discriminatory for reasons of national origin.</text>

            <text syncTime="2005.041" offset="8169240">At any rate, he is claiming that his discharge was discriminatory and he's claiming it both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.945" offset="8192855">He's claiming that the ultimate discharge of him on June 30, 1975, was discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.765" offset="8216156">He's also claiming that his discharge was caused by the tenure denial and that the discharge was discriminatory and that that process, that discriminatory process of the denial of tenure caused a discriminatory discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.441" offset="8278850">So he's going at it from both ways, and I want to make that clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="2200.715" offset="8951973">I believe Footnote 19 in Mohasco, I believe it's Footnote 19, speaks to that issue when it talks about whether or not charge has to be filed within 180 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.703" offset="8987918">It makes specific reference to Olson v. Rembrandt Publishing Company, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.489" offset="9003069">But it doesn't say... it says clearly that it doesn't have to be filed within 180 days, and it suggests in that footnote that the charge doesn't have to be filed timely with the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.980" offset="9044969">I would also like to point out, Justice Rehnquist, that there's some question as to whether Dr. Ricks's charge was untimely with the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.467" offset="9074958">What the state did with that charge was to waive jurisdiction over to the EEOC, and I'd submit that the waiver of jurisdiction, inherent in that waiver is the power to review the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.259" offset="9118112">The state assumed that it had jurisdiction, it didn't dismiss the charge as an untimely charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.829" offset="9140368">Clearly that was not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.263" offset="9146115">What it did was, it simply waived over to the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.030" offset="9157191">So that if you pick up on the Mohasco theory, it seems to me that you can count that 300 days from the point at which, the earliest point at which Dr. Ricks could have filed his charge with the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.457" offset="9206928">That date would have been April 28, 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.659" offset="9219676">You count back 300 days, there are a number of acts that occurred, that in and of themselves might, would be timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.682" offset="9259800">You go back to July 2, 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.967" offset="9272966">Clearly the notice of nonrenewal on 6-26-74 would not be included, but, as in the supplemental brief, I indicated the contract that was referred to in that notice was signed by the College President on behalf of the College on August 16, 1974, and it was executed by Dr. Ricks on September 3, 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.582" offset="9367425">Those two dates are within the 300-day period, if you assume the Mohasco reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.236" offset="9386024">In addition, the College issued to Dr. Ricks a notice that tenure had in fact been denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.890" offset="9412669">After the review of the educational policy decision, the Board had decided to deny him tenure and that notice was issued on September 12, 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.996" offset="9445061">Again, for purposes of Title VII, if you assume the Mohasco treatment of the case and the 300 days applies, that September 12, 1974, date is within the 300-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.303" offset="9490305">I might also add that it's within the three-year period for purposes of Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.338" offset="9510471">We both agree, and both the District Court and the Court of Appeals held that it was a three-year Delaware statute of limitations that applied to the 1981 claim, that the Court complaint was filed on September 9, 1977, and if you go back three years to September 9, 1974, clearly the college issued its letter on September 12, '74 and that period is within the three-year period.</text>

            <text syncTime="3052.575" offset="12359386">I think a better rule is the rule of the employee's remaining on the job and the point at which the work terminates, that that's a point from which violation of termination or discharge can properly be alleged.</text>
