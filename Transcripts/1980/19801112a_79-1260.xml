            <text syncTime="3148.647" offset="12745913">And I submit the big reason for that is the government sunshine policies that we have in our state, the fact that in our state, when our citizens go to a county commission meeting or a city commission meeting, even our clemency meetings in capital cases, they see the television camera; the camera is present at all of those proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.950" offset="12843089">So it is not in any way a novel experience for the citizens of our state to be around television equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.572" offset="12877570">It has become commonplace in Florida, as the presence of cameras and television obviously have become commonplace in our daily lives.</text>

            <text syncTime="3368.406" offset="13624881">Zamora was a peculiar case because the defense in that case was that cameras made the defendant insane and the defendant invited cameras in the courtroom.</text>
