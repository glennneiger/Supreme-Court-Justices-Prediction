            <text syncTime="16.042" offset="156221">In the first of these cases, Cuyler v. Adams, a question is raised of the relationship between the Interstate Agreement on Detainers and the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.381" offset="221527">The specific issue that we decided is whether a prisoner confined in a State that has adopted the Extradition Act is entitled the procedural protections of that Act, particularly the right to a pretransfer hearing before being transferred to another State pursuant to Article IV for the Detainer Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.314" offset="321315">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit applied federal law and construed the two statutes as entitling the prisoner to such protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.549" offset="370216">And for that reason, the Court of Appeals did not reach or decide a constitutional claim which was also urged.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.950" offset="407832">In contrast, the Pennsylvania Superior Court which is the Intermediate Appellate Court of that State did reach the constitutional claims and held that state prisoners transferred under Article IV, the Detainer Agreement, had no constitutional right to a pretransfer hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.668" offset="494663">The Third Circuit Court of Appeals view was that the constitutional question need not be reached because the Detainer Agreement is an interstate compact approved by congress under the Compact Clause and thus as a federal law subject to federal rather than state construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.163" offset="588704">We affirm the holdings of the Court of Appeals both in its ruling that the Detainer Agreement is a federal compact subject to federal construction and in its construction that the statutes are to be construed to entitle a prisoner before being transferred of the procedural protections of the Extradition Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.433" offset="681700">Our reasons for reaching that result are set forth at length in an opinion filed with the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.506" offset="710017">Justice Rehnquist joined by the Chief Justice and Justice Stewart has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
