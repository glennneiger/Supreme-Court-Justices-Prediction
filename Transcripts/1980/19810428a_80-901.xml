            <text syncTime="68.676" offset="423894">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="72.237" offset="438104">The issue in this case is whether a federal mine inspector is required to obtain a search warrant before conducting a routine safety and health inspection of mine facilities such as stone quarries pursuant to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.714" offset="511979">The four courts of appeals that have addressed this question have upheld the constitutionality of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.414" offset="538832">However, the district court in this case concluded that a warrant was required to search appellee's quarry and therefore declared the warrantless inspection provisions of the statute unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.128" offset="589614">The Government has taken a direct appeal from that ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.220" offset="602049">The facts may be briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.844" offset="612498">The appellee, Waukesha Lime and Stone Company, operates a limestone quarry and mill facility in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.701" offset="643949">The quarry consists of two open pits that are as deep as 30 feet in some places.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.730" offset="668086">Generally, about three times a day workers use explosives to dislodge pieces of rock from the wall of the quarry.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.539" offset="703299">The limestone is then taken to a crushing facility where it is crushed and sorted according to size, and the stone is then taken to a building known as the dust house where it is dried, ground, and bagged for direct sale to customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.938" offset="760873">Waukesha's facility has been subject to regular safety and health inspections by state officials for about 60 years and it has been subject to federal safety and health inspection since 1966 when Congress passed the predecessor of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.400" offset="834748">Now, in April, 1978, a federal mine inspector showed up at Waukesha's mine to conduct a routine health and safety inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.146" offset="869752">Following the inspection he cited Waukesha for 25 violations of mandatory health and safety standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.737" offset="900054">A few months later the same inspector showed up to conduct a follow-up inspection to determine whether Waukesha had corrected the most serious of these violations, specifically, whether the airborne concentrations of silica dust in the dust house had been lowered.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.433" offset="974868">Inhalation of excessive amounts of silica dust leads to a condition known as silicosis which is a very serious respiratory disease, even more serious than black lung disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.351" offset="1022516">Waukesha's president, appellee Douglas Dewey, refused to allow the inspector to undertake the follow-up inspection without a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.704" offset="1063998">At that point the inspector discontinued the inspection and issued a citation to the company for denial of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.499" offset="1091166">The citation was followed by a proposed civil penalty of $1,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.325" offset="1114467">In addition, the Secretary thereafter brought this action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, to enjoin appellees from refusing to permit warrantless inspections of their quarry pursuant to the Mine Safety Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.929" offset="1172877">And as I noted a moment ago, the district court denied that injunction and instead held in reliance on this Court's decision in Marshall v. Barlow's that the Act's warrantless inspection provisions violate the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.953" offset="1224912">Mr. Geller, you're doubtless familiar with the Steagald case that this Court decided a couple of weeks ago, where it said that law enforcement officers, even though they possess an arrest warrant, could not go into the house of a third person to seize the person for whom they had the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.226" offset="1326059">Now, certainly crime has been a heavily regulated business in the last 50 or 60 years just like mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.519" offset="1359182">If one were to apply Steagald to this type of case, don't you think the district court's opinion probably has something to be said for it?</text>

            <text syncTime="312.046" offset="1397321">I think if Steagald were applicable to this sort of case, the district court's opinion would have a lot to be said for it, but we don't read Steagald as wiping out the exception to the warrant requirement exemplified by cases such as Biswell, for pervasively regulated businesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="341.191" offset="1513931">It's passed a statute which we think is quite similar to the statute that this Court upheld in Biswell, and I don't recall that there was anything in the Steagald opinion which cast any doubt on the continuing validity of Biswell, and therefore we continue to rely on Biswell.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.370" offset="1578610">This is a regulatory search, for purposes of finding whether there are health and safety violations and not for purposes of finding evidence of a crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="382.830" offset="1680488">Well, I think... there are two key cases that... of course, we rely on Colonnade and Biswell, and there's a tendency which we have fallen into as much as the other party does, to lump the two exceptions together in sort of a Colonnade-Biswell exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.152" offset="1733778">I think analytically there are really two separate exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.650" offset="1751750">Colonnade, I think dealt with a situation in which there had been an extremely long history of pervasive government regulation in an area--</text>

            <text syncTime="416.691" offset="1815907">And the Court found in that situation that Congress could reasonably authorize warrantless inspections to carry out the purposes of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.812" offset="1852374">Without any further inquiry having to be made as to the need for warrantless searches it's interesting to read the Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.387" offset="1874734">There's no discussion of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1128.404" offset="4662731">Now, I think it's important, in trying to focus on why there isn't the need for a warrant in this case, to look at what the statutory protections are for mine operators in order to determine what further protection a warrant would provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.458" offset="4746950">Now, I think the best way to demonstrate that a warrant would be of virtually no practical value in the mine safety context, and would add virtually no protection to these minimal privacy interests that we think mine operators have in these open pits, is to contrast mine inspections with the sorts of inspections that were involved in the Camara and See cases, where the Court held that a warrant was required for routine housing inspections, and in Barlow's, which involved health inspections under the Occupational Safety and Health Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.071" offset="4865441">The Court stated in Camara and it repeated in Barlow's that a warrant would serve a valuable purpose in those situations because it would limit the unbridled discretion of the inspector as to when and whom to search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.924" offset="4916850">The Court stated, in addition, that a warrant would assure the homeowner or the businessman that the inspection was authorized by statute, and was conducted pursuant to an administrative plan containing specific neutral criteria, and that it would advise the owner of the precise scope and objects of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.121" offset="4985605">Now, these points make a great deal of sense, especially Camara, but also in the Barlow's situation, Camara--</text>

            <text syncTime="1232.659" offset="5079750">But I think we concede freely that Barlow's involved a situation where six million businesses were subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act, but only about 80,000 businesses were searched every year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.027" offset="5129278">Therefore, when an OSHA inspector up at the door, the businessman really had no reason to know whether he properly was there, whether it was in fact an OSHA inspector or what were the standards that we used to pick that particular business, what were the limits of the search power of the officer?</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.319" offset="5194375">I think it's a totally different situation when we're dealing with mine inspectors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.895" offset="5216736">Every mine subject to the Mine Safety Act... and that includes virtually every mine in the nation... has to register with the Secretary of Labor, has to be familiar with all of the health and safety standards promulgated by the Secretary of Labor, gets a copy of every health and safety standard promulgated by the Secretary of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.262" offset="5290192">The statute that regulates this industry sets forth a minimum number of inspections that have to take place every single year.</text>

            <text syncTime="1332.290" offset="5478274">The statute itself sets forth the neutral criteria that would allow the search to take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.850" offset="5504501">One has to ask what additional value a warrant would provide in that situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.175" offset="5525817">Now, the point of all this, I think, is that a warrant here, just as in Biswell... and in Biswell, I might add, the Court made the same analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.796" offset="5576286">The Court pointed out in Biswell that someone who engaged in a licensed business of dealing in firearms is given a copy of all the regulations that are applicable to his business and is told in advance of what the limits of the searching officer's powers are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.054" offset="5633337">And the Court said, we don't think that the additional benefits that a warrant would provide in that situation are very meaningful or outweigh the need for frequent, unannounced inspections, which the Court found in the Biswell situation and we assert in this case, Congress found were essential to accomplishing of the statutory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.422" offset="5706793">And the point of all this is that a warrant here, just as in Biswell, would tell the mine operator absolutely nothing that he doesn't already know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.482" offset="5747022">And because the Act contains legislative standards that would certainly satisfy the administrative probable cause standard of Camara and Barlow's, we think that mine inspectors could procure a warrant prior to these frequent routine inspections virtually for the asking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.678" offset="5811806">Moreover, mine inspectors don't have the unbridled discretion under the Act, but are carefully limited by statute as to who, when, and how often they are to search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.330" offset="5854437">It's therefore difficult to see how even the minimal privacy interests that a mine operator might have in these pits would be benefited in any meaningful way by requiring resort to the warrant process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.387" offset="5910653">A warrant would simply become an empty gesture, we think, under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.995" offset="5925072">Now, even though a warrantless context serves no useful purpose, I suppose there would be no great lasting harm in insisting on a warrant if the mine safety and health enforcement program would not be adversely affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.300" offset="5986303">But Congress reasonably concluded that a warrant requirement would seriously cut the Act's enforcement objectives because of the "notorious ease"... and that's the phrase taken from the Senate report... the notorious ease with which many mine hazards may be concealed or corrected temporarily if an inspector has given advance warning of an inspection.</text>

            <text syncTime="1564.509" offset="6407188">That's the Scotia mine disaster which took the lives of 23 miners and three mine inspectors in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.863" offset="6436550">There the evidence showed after the fact that the mine operator had been moving certain brattices which controlled the amount of ventilation in the mine after the inspector had left, but had made it appear through some sort of cosmetic changes that there had been adequate ventilation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.279" offset="6510215">And in fact, in this very case... this is a very useful example... what the inspector was going back in to see was whether this quarry had controlled the level of silica dust in the dust house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.149" offset="6557758">Now, it seems clear that if advance notice had been given, such as by showing up and being refused entry until he went back and got a warrant, a quarry could well take cosmetic changes such as shutting down the machines for awhile or opening up the windows for awhile to make it seem as if the dust levels were lower than they really are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.438" offset="6634872">Of course, mine inspectors could try to solve this problem by getting a warrant before showing up in the first place, but I think that would produce a massive administrative burden.</text>

            <text syncTime="1659.548" offset="6787322">Let me put to you at the outset a question I put to your friend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.515" offset="6795159">What about the hypothetical: Congress after identifying building construction as being within the reach of federal legislative power, laying that aside, then decided that they were going to have inspectors who could come on the on-site of any building more than 100 feet high at any time during the course of construction to inspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.865" offset="6892648">Let's make it 100 so they don't come into one-story houses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1693.799" offset="6924308">I don't think there's any history of pervasive regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1707.950" offset="6980942">And it is random, it is random inspection by building inspectors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.558" offset="6995361">I don't know that 100 feet is the limit but tall buildings always have random inspections during construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.977" offset="7029007">Now that's pervasive throughout the country, municipal, sometimes the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="1730.239" offset="7070072">Those were building, one was a building inspection, one was a fire inspection, and the requirement there was for warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.188" offset="7101941">So I think your question really is Justice Stewart's question, can you select an industry and having selected an industry avoid the normal Fourth Amendment requirements of a warrant?</text>

            <text syncTime="1790.823" offset="7312383">I think that that's a distinguishing factor in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.587" offset="7331505">I think in this issue of pervasive regulation, there are some considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.007" offset="7357210">If you analyze the industries that this Court has found to be pervasively regulated, they cover a broad spectrum of activities in within the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.315" offset="7398379">The liquor concerns are taxed going back to the Revolution, but after Prohibition we enacted 27 U.S. Code, which tells the distiller or the brewer what size, or he has to have a permit to have a brewery or distillery, he has to... the size bottles that he puts in, the makeup of what he sells, is regulated; who he sells to is regulated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1927.471" offset="7859074">I'm afraid there is no litmus test for pervasive regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.282" offset="7878300">There is no one thing, I think, that I agree that licensing is but a factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.154" offset="7901706">Obviously, this business is not licensed nor has it ever been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.778" offset="7916230">The other factors which are important are the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.853" offset="7936501">I think that that's something that you have to look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.509" offset="7943188">The peppered... that was a pervasive... pardon the use of the word... consideration, perhaps, in Colonnade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.708" offset="7988014">And if you look at the history of this particular industry, I think you find that there was really no meaningful federal regulation of this quarry until, really, 1978, when the 1977 Act become effective, because the Act of 1966 merely established certain advisory standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.573" offset="8091459">It provided that there was really no citation authority in the inspecting agents; it provided for one inspection a year, and now we've gone to two... I don't regard that change as significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.895" offset="8148720">It also provided that in a very narrow area of cases involving non-coal mines, inspectors could issue what were known as withdrawal orders, which would have the effect of a temporary shutdown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.936" offset="8204831">The nature, if you read those orders, it's hard to equate those with a limestone quarry, an open-pit limestone quarry especially.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.761" offset="8232207">But what I'm trying to say is that the language of the Court in Barlow's talks about a long tradition of close governmental supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.304" offset="8274317">And I suggest to the Court that there's no way you can look at this particular industry and say there's a long tradition of close governmental supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.222" offset="8314023">I'd also point out to the Court that I think what the Government is trying to do is to piggyback the long tradition, if you will, of government control of the coal mine by... because what happened in 1977 was that Congress amended the Coal Act, did away with the act that affected us, the act of '66, and incorporated by amendment and by definition everything that was in the various mining industries and brought them all under the same strictures that had controlled the coal industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.693" offset="8443903">And, I don't challenge the wisdom or the right of the Congress to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.112" offset="8465637">I'm only saying that that doesn't give the Congress the right, however, to do away with the Fourth Amendment expectations of this particular industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.031" offset="8505239">The other concern which I have is the argument, or the suggestion of an argument that solely because of the injury rate, or the dangerousness, if you will, of a particular industry, that this standing alone gives the Congress the right to mandate warrantless entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.347" offset="8622477">Now, I don't think any of us are unsympathetic with the goals of government to cut down injuries, but I think that there is no case that this Court has ever decided which ever said that injury alone is a justification for waiver of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.058" offset="8697396">If we go that route and start establishing those criteria, I suggest we'll be plowing new ground, and perhaps, Justice Rehnquist, opening the door for some of the things that you suggested by your questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.490" offset="8751103">There are certainly areas in American life where everyone would agree... the Congress, or us, or everyone... would agree that there is a significant dangerousness to most of us as citizens, whether we be workers involved or citizens exposed to certain hazards.</text>

            <text syncTime="3182.814" offset="12880436">But really, I'm arguing that my case is Barlow's, which is not that old, and there's been no change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.843" offset="12904468">As a matter of fact, the change, if anything, is it's a little safer now than it was three years ago, I think, although there really isn't any significant change since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.967" offset="12932994">I'm saying that that alone is not the basis, safety considerations alone are not the basis to justify an erosion of the normal Fourth Amendment rights of the operator in court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3228.734" offset="13064024">And a long history of regulation is only one factor, as I said before.</text>

            <label>Mr. Francis R. Croak</label>
            <text syncTime="3256.098" offset="13173530">--Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.395" offset="13174679">In Wisconsin there is a warrant procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.063" offset="13201428">I would be candid, this operator has never insisted it be used, but it exists and our reference is in our brief to the statute, that there is a provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.060" offset="13241343">And the Government alluded to the fact that this mine has been inspected since 1922.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.088" offset="13261510">I think, in all candor, though, I must say that that inspection... and I think the record bears me out in this, was the kind of inspection that you get under the Wisconsin worker's compensation law, and I think the testimony showed that the same people that were inspecting the department store, were inspecting the factory, were involved in mine inspection, for many, many years because Wisconsin had a comprehensive worker's compensation law that covered anybody that employed more than two people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.001" offset="13357118">But there is, as I say, under that law today there exists a statutory provision for obtaining what is called an inspection warrant.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="3316.370" offset="13414588">Just one or two things, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.995" offset="13425141">I'd like to just speak for a moment to what I think is the key question in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.947" offset="13440919">Certainly it's the key question as posed by Biswell, but it's not something that I think the appellee has addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.960" offset="13460981">And that is, if in order to satisfy an urgent federal interest Congress determines that warrantless searches are essential, and if the warrant requirement would not provide any meaningful additional protections to the businessman in terms of either limiting discretion of the searching officer or in giving the businessman information as to why the officer is there, why is Congress's decision to set up a provision such as that unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment?</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.526" offset="13583234">What is the benefit of insisting on a warrant procedure under those circumstances, especially if it means that the urgent federal interest can't be accomplished?</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.413" offset="13614790">Now, the appellee has never identified what a warrant would bring him in a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.678" offset="13635897">He's mentioned one thing in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.395" offset="13642689">He says, if there had been a warrant, the inspector couldn't have done what he did here, which is to show up and walk around our premises for an hour without telling us he was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.845" offset="13676543">But I think that a warrant wouldn't have done anything about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.500" offset="13691172">He could have had a warrant and still walked onto the premises and not identified himself for an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.202" offset="13709980">By the way, I should add that the statute prohibits showing up without identifying yourself to the mine operator, who has a right to walk around with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.902" offset="13740700">So the statute provides that protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.605" offset="13747597">In fact, the Stoudt's Ferry case, which is a case that was decided by the 3rd Circuit under the statute, shows that a warrant was really not a meaningful protection, but the injunction procedure under the statute may well be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.708" offset="13792005">The mine operator in Stoudt's Ferry refused to let the inspector in claiming that he had some trade secrets he wanted to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.143" offset="13821680">When the Secretary sued for an injunction the district court molded the injunction to take account of these trade secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.406" offset="13846757">But if the inspector had simply gotten the warrant, if this Court would have decided that one is necessary, and showed up, it wouldn't have taken account of any of these trade secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.168" offset="13881761">By the way, Justice Stevens, I think that the statute does prohibit forcible entries for the same reason I think the statute in Colonnade did, because there's no specific provision in there that allows it, and the Court interpreted the statute involved in Colonnade as not allowing forcible entries unless Congress specifically says so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.192" offset="13953859">Here Congress has provided alternative remedies when an inspector is refused entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.518" offset="13975175">One is the civil penalty and another is the injunction proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.423" offset="13994819">And just finally, Justice Stewart, about the licensing requirement, I think the situation is really no different than it was under the Gun Control Act, even though there was a license there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.826" offset="14028465">When the Gun Control Act was passed people who were in that business had to comply with the provisions of that statute or go out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.260" offset="14066186">The same way here: the Secretary or whatever can shut down mines that refuse to comply with the provisions of the Mine Safety Act, including this provision that they comply with health and safety standards and allow for inspections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.769" offset="14116237">People who don't want to continue under those circumstances are free to go out of business but I don't know that it makes that much difference whether there's a physical piece of paper labeled a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.062" offset="14153435">Congress could easily, if that, if this Court finds that that's what the defect in the statute is, put in a licensing requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.264" offset="14174228">That wouldn't change any of the other provisions of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.559" offset="14187394">Thank you.</text>
