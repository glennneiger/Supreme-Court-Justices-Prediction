            <label>Mr. Jerome I. Chapman</label>
            <text syncTime="72.096" offset="424478">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="77.093" offset="444540">The Petitioners are here to ask the Court to reverse a decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which we believe is not only contrary to established principles but creates a very serious practical impediment on the ability of District Courts to coordinate and control multi-party complex litigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.898" offset="535760">It is our submission that the decision of the Ninth Circuit out back on the normal rule of finality of judgments in the context of multiple-party, multiple action litigation which is exactly the opposite of what should have been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.874" offset="611620">That is, in these classes of cases there is more rather than less need for adherence to res judicata and the rule of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.745" offset="651117">We would like to take a few moments to describe briefly the background of this case and how it comes to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.289" offset="685285">And then to present what we consider the principal reasons why we believe that the Ninth Circuit decision is contrary to established principles of res judicata and out of step with the salutary trends in improving the abilities of the District Court to control and coordinate complex cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.313" offset="761353">The present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.202" offset="768981">Your Honor, started the same way as have hundreds of class action cases in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.528" offset="790297">It's a class action for treble damages and attorneys fees and other relief, following on the heels of a federal government action.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.758" offset="839198">In April of 1976, the federal government obtained a misdemeanor indictment against Petitioners under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, charging that the Petitioners had agreed on the prices of women's clothings in their stores in Northern California.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.077" offset="916416">Shortly thereafter, a multiplicity of private class actions were filed; there were seven in all, two of those were filed by the same counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.008" offset="980155">One of the actions, which was entitled Moitie v. Federated and Saks has been voluntarily dismissed by the Plaintiffs, and that action is not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.694" offset="1006904">The other action is the Brown case, which is the only case that is before the Court this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.754" offset="1031146">The complaint in the Brown case, as I say, was largely patterned on the government's pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.045" offset="1072315">It alleged that the Petitioners had agreed to charge certain prices in their stores on women's clothing and that the Plaintiffs and the class members that were purportedly represented had been injured by being overcharged on those purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.445" offset="1149951">The one difference was that unlike the government action and the other six class actions, the Brown case alleged that the violations took place in Southern California, rather than in Northern California.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.860" offset="1203554">Now, the cases proceeded in the District Court before a... they were coordinated before a single judge and in July of 1976, the Petitioners moved to dismiss all seven cases for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).</text>
            <text syncTime="287.274" offset="1285265">There was extensive briefing on the motion, in fact, the District Court set aside one entire day for oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.383" offset="1293624">And in January of 1977, the District Court dismissed all seven cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.613" offset="1334584">There were several issues considered, but the primary ground that was relied upon in the District Court's dismissal was that the Plaintiffs and class members as retail purchasers did not allege an injury to their business or property which would entitle them to treble damage recovery under the Clayton Act, Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.871" offset="1407623">The parties in five of the other cases appealed, and we've referred to these for convenience in our brief, as the Weinberg cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.524" offset="1438238">The Weinberg cases all took an appeal from the dismissal of their actions to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.085" offset="1464465">However, Brown deliberately chose to break away from the other cases at this point, and did not appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.550" offset="1506366">When the time for appeal had expired, the Respondent Brown filed a new action in the municipal court in Palo Alto-Mountain View judicial district, which was in all material respects absolutely identical to the prior case.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.793" offset="1563313">And we've referred to these again, for convenience, the prior dismissed action as Brown I; the second action, which is the action now before this Court as Brown II.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.117" offset="1604586">As I say, Brown I and Brown II were essentially identical, the same parties were involved, were alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.458" offset="1638023">There were the same descriptions of trade and commerce, exactly the same offenses charged, the same alleged effects of the offenses were charged, the same time period was covered, the period up to April, 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.733" offset="1683058">The same geographic area was covered in both complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.389" offset="1701657">They were the exact verbatim allegations of fraudulent concealment and verbatim the same allegations of the alleged injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.307" offset="1733318">The only difference which we submit, and we believe the... both Courts below perceived as cosmetic differences... was that the word antitrust was not mentioned in the Brown II complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.552" offset="1794340">Instead, the complaint was framed in terms of four theories under California law: fraud and deceit, unfair business practices, civil conspiracy and restitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.873" offset="1851600">But there has never been any question at any time in this case that the gravamen of the two complaints, Brown I and Brown II, the basic thrust and core of both complaints is absolutely identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.008" offset="1908129">They charge that the Petitioners agreed on their prices of women's clothing prior to April, 1974, in Southern California and that that agreement had the effect of causing the--</text>

            <text syncTime="1870.703" offset="7618914">Now Hodge, is very interesting, because it causes me to disagree with a great deal of the authority cited by my opposition.</text>

Gibbs if there is no substantial federal question, state claim as a matter of comity belong in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.329" offset="7737406">That California law follows that is cited... is stated very clearly in the case we cite as Merry v. Coast Community College, where the... and I'm quoting the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals consistently held that where a federal claim dismissed on a motion for summary judgment before there has been a substantial expenditure of the Court's time or energy on the case, proper exercise of discretion requires dismissal of the state claims without prejudice to plaintiff's right to litigate them in a proper state forum.</text>

            <text syncTime="2611.364" offset="10581618">I would like, Mr. Chief Justice, to make two brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.659" offset="10598754">First, the issue that is presented in this petition is the Ninth Circuit's ruling that in multiple-party actions, the appeal by certain parties relieves the party who didn't appeal from the normal application of res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.090" offset="10660508">It's our submission, for the reasons in our briefs, that this would create a tremendous hardship and burden in the administration of complex, multiple-party class actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.946" offset="10699900">The Respondent's submission, Your Honor, would, if accepted, create a burden in all cases, because he is arguing in favor of piecemeal litigation, that you don't have to bring forward once you come into a federal court, or whatever court with your first complaint, you don't have to bring forward all your theories, you don't have to bring forward all of your rights for recovery, you don't have to give the district court discretion to choose whether or not to handle all the cases at one time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.341" offset="10813481">So we believe that the issue presented by Respondents is not properly here, and we urge reversal of the Ninth Circuit and reinstatement of the district court's decision.</text>
