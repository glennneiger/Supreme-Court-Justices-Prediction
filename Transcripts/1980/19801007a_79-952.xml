            <text syncTime="1426.800" offset="5852396">The answer is that the contributions are made solely by the employers to the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.704" offset="5876011">There are no general tax funds, although I would suppose that the employer views it as a tax on the employer to create the fund in the first place.</text>

            <text syncTime="1452.666" offset="5955841">I do not believe the Review Board has ever conceded that there is not a compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.271" offset="5986352">There is some ambiguous language in the opinion of the State Court of Appeals which seems to say that at oral argument there may have been a concession by the State on a compelling state interest issue but the Review Board's position is only that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.447" offset="6051031">There is no evidence on the record as to the existence or nonexistence of a compelling state interest, and the reason for that blank record is that the Review Board was not a party at the hearing stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.041" offset="6101395">The Review Board has never had any opportunity to present facts into evidence on the existence or nonexistence of a compelling state interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1889.695" offset="7703955">As I read the opinion of the Indiana Supreme Court, that Court based its decision on three general and independent grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.401" offset="7742826">There are three different grounds for sustaining the Indiana Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.288" offset="7758395">First of all, the Court found that the statutory good cause requirement has a valid secular purpose and a valid secular effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.977" offset="7797160">In other words, the Braunfeld v. Brown test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.096" offset="7805624">Under that test we have a valid secular purpose, a valid secular effect; it is therefore a constitutional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.267" offset="7834254">Secondly, the Indiana Supreme Court found that the grant of an exemption to Mr. Thomas would conflict with the Establishment Clause in the Constitution, as a second independent grounds, also requiring that the statute be found to be constitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="1961.225" offset="7990153">And I'd like to address that question now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.314" offset="8022440">In Walz v. the New York Tax Commission, this Court noted that past opinions had considerable internal inconsistency because of certain sweeping statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.621" offset="8067684">This Court also recognized that there could be a potential conflict between the religion clauses, and a test proposed in Walz v. New York Tax Commission is, first of all, examine the legislative purpose; secondly, examine the degree of involvement between church and state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.619" offset="8151694">The current Indiana practice withstands these tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.587" offset="8167577">Legislative purpose is a valid secular purpose, the degree of involvement is almost zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.509" offset="8195266">The only reason that the Court had to examine the sincerity or the contents of Mr. Thomas's beliefs was because it had to distinguish Sherbert, or perhaps Wisconsin v. Yoder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.234" offset="8242182">Under the current procedure in Indiana there is really no reason beyond those cases for an examination or for an involvement of the church with the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.892" offset="8288785">However, if the state were to pass a statute saying that persons in Mr. Thomas's situation are exempt from the objective good cause requirement, if you examine that statute, the statute proposed by Mr. Thomas here... although Mr. Thomas is not proposing a statute, he's proposing the Court do something to the same effect, to create for Indiana an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.459" offset="8395051">If the Court were to create that exemption or if the Legislature in Indiana were to create that exemption and were examined under the Walz test, you would have to find a secular legislative purpose for an exemption for people in Mr. Thomas's situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.671" offset="8471851">Now I submit that there is no reasonable secular purpose for that exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.408" offset="8490868">I don't think you will find a reasonable purpose stated in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.044" offset="8513438">I've noted one amicus brief seems to think that a secular purpose would be avoidance of conflict with the religion clauses and that argument seems to me somewhat circular.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.436" offset="8558995">You can point out as a secular purpose for the denial of the relief an avoidance of conflict with the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.958" offset="8597030">In any event, there is no valid secular purpose for the establishment of exemption; the degree of involvement escalates terrifically if you grant an exemption for religious purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.950" offset="8649066">Then it becomes necessary to examine Mr. Thomas or people in his position to determine whether or not he actually has a sincere belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.288" offset="8682398">You have to examine whether or not that belief is a religious belief, as opposed to a merely personal belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.644" offset="8715835">And you run into the problem that Mr. Rehnquist suggested in one of his early questions: if you create that exemption statutorily, you run into the problem of the conscientious objector cases and you perhaps have to interpret the statutory exemption in such a way that it applies to everybody whether it's a religious exemption or merely a deeply held personal conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2986.935" offset="12092945">First we would like to address the contention of the respondent that the Court of Appeals never said there was there was a concession of no compelling state interest and we would like to address the attention of the Court to pages 13(a) and 19(a) of our petition for certiorari where the Court of Appeals clearly said that the task of applying Sherbert in this case is focused by the Board's concession in oral argument that no compelling state interest exists in this case to justify an infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.876" offset="12248739">So it is very clear, there was a concession in oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.328" offset="12262532">Second, the Board contends that in Sherbert there was a discriminatory effect in relation to Sunday worshipers that is not present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.136" offset="12309761">The truth of the matter is that Sherbert was decided on First Amendment, not on the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.508" offset="12347273">Also, the interests now asserted by the State for the first time before this Court in these proceedings were already rejected in Sherbert like Justice Stevens pointed... And this Court has stated that only the gravest abuses endangering paramount interests permit infringement on First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.393" offset="12450822">Those grave abuses are not present in this case.</text>
