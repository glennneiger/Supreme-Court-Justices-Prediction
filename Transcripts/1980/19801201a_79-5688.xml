            <text syncTime="184.451" offset="871185">I can point that out.</text>

            <text syncTime="472.898" offset="2024962">It would not be, because I feel that there is no constitutional guarantee of a motion for directed verdict, or even for an appeal for that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.190" offset="2070101">I feel that as long as all people are treated alike, it makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.725" offset="2084207">All I'm saying is that in this case, in Louisiana law, there is no motion for directed verdict available to the defendant in a jury trial and the first time, by their law, that he can raise the issue of insufficient evidence is on motion for new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.335" offset="2146692">I don't think that that in and of itself is unconstitutional, but I do feel that in this case that the ruling of the trial judge could not have been clearer.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.308" offset="2202594">Indeed, the entire ruling which is transcribed for the Court, it sets the basis for his ruling, what he observed, and the factual basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="565.741" offset="2396319">At the very outside he is saying there was insufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to convict this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.978" offset="2421292">That would be taking his statement most favorably to the State's position.</text>

            <text syncTime="591.056" offset="2497569">If they... in effect, what they were saying was, if you move for a new trial, you waive the argument to your constitutional double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.045" offset="2525468">But I think that is particularly innocuous here, because under Louisiana law it was the only vehicle he had.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.764" offset="2544381">You know, if you're requiring a man, he can't waive that issue until a motion for a new trial, and then at the same time, you're saying, but if you do raise it you waive your double jeopardy argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.322" offset="2594640">And that's why I think that this particular statutory system is possibly unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.428" offset="2631003">If it were applied in a meaning where you said, because I asked for a new trial, I do waive my right to raise double jeopardy, then I think it's unconstitutional, as requiring him to choose between two constitutional safeguards.</text>

            <text syncTime="653.530" offset="2747404">No, sir, because double jeopardy does, as this Court clearly set out in Burks, that that is not a jeopardy question, where it's an error of law, and where it's simply both sides need a different, or a new chance to put on and correct that error.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.891" offset="2808844">But this Court has, I think, clearly said in Burks that where there's a failure to muster sufficient evidence the state doesn't get a second chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.478" offset="2839251">And in this case is what they got, and indeed they came forth at the second trial with an eyewitness, ten months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.853" offset="2880733">The second position, I think, that is... again, I will use this term "faulty premise" that the Louisiana Supreme Court is using, is simply that they are attempting to apply the no evidence rule on both ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.748" offset="2956279">On one end they're saying the trial judge says, merely insufficient evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.200" offset="2970176">And I would say, and my argument is that that is, when you say it's insufficient beyond a reasonable doubt, you've said it all.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.853" offset="2996717">But then, on the other hand, to try to apply the no evidence rule under existing Louisiana procedure, and say, because we have a dichotomy between no evidence and insufficient evidence that we are not going to apply, in essence, the Burks decision of the standard of reasonable doubt, as In Re: Winship.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.202" offset="3082190">I think there, from both ends, that their premise is faulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.106" offset="3109775">And I would assert that as recently as 1980, May of 1980, the court of Louisiana, the Supreme Court of Louisiana, has maintained their position, and that is, they have said that in the case of... if I may have a drink of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.725" offset="3232237">In May of 1980, in the State v. Custard... it's the state court of Louisiana, they stated then that</text>
            <text syncTime="788.485" offset="3287303">"This court has yet fully to embrace Jackson v. Virginia. "</text>
            <text syncTime="791.520" offset="3299424">And that's where this Court, I think, laid to rest the dichotomy between the no evidence rule and the application of the rule of insufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, and adopted, and indeed said that even on federal, and I recognize that Jackson is a very limited opinion, and it's limited to habeas corpus review by federal district judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.600" offset="3387718">Now, I think this case that is now before this Court here is the next logical sequence, or logical step, in applying that standard in requiring the states through the Fourteenth and the Fifth Amendments to adhere to that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.210" offset="3450203">And the footnotes in this case by the Louisiana Supreme Court fully state that they haven't made up their mind whether or not they're going to follow that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.018" offset="3497432">And I think that's what we're asking this Court to do is to give direction to the Supreme Court of Louisiana and advise them that they will have to embrace the reasonable doubt standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="1582.779" offset="6464420">In other words, the trial judge made his ruling and the State took writs and the writs were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.997" offset="6481347">And they were denied because of this Louisiana dichotomy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1701.369" offset="6938803">I agree with Mr. Burst that this really is limited and involves interpretation of the particular statutes that our Code of Criminal Procedure has dealing with new trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.279" offset="6990421">The State's position is that the trial judge, when he made the comment, he said that</text>

            <text syncTime="1728.919" offset="7049040">As I said, the State's position is that he was stating his opinion after he had heard the same evidence that the jury heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.358" offset="7074745">Now, the trial judge at that time didn't have the benefit of Burks and Jackson v. Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.196" offset="7098150">The problem that we run into is that in commenting on the evidence it would seem to the State that the best answer is, what does the record really reflect?</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.135" offset="7141827">We have an article for a new trial which deals with five subsections, and though the judge may call up one subsection or another, he could be in error.</text>

            <text syncTime="1766.977" offset="7201282">Of course, the State's position was, we agree with Judge Tate that, although because the trial judge did not have the benefit of Burks and Jackson, he didn't articulate particularly and he did not assign one particular subsection or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.404" offset="7262931">But even if he had, isn't it really what the record reflects?</text>
