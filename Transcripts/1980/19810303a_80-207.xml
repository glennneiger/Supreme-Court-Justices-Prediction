            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="154523">We'll hear arguments first this morning in CBS v. The Federal Communications Commission and the related cases.</text>

            <label>Mr. Floyd Abrams</label>
            <text syncTime="16.260" offset="219516">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="24.448" offset="252221">This consolidated case comes to this Court on writs of certiorari to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.852" offset="281896">It involves a decision of that court affirming two 4 to 3 rulings of the Federal Communications Commission that ABC, CBS and NBC violated Section 312(a)(7) of the Federal Communications Act by declining to sell one half hour of prime time on their networks to the Carter-Mondale Committee during a specified four-day period, during the first week in December of 1979... a time 11 months before the national election, 8 months before the Democratic National Convention, almost three months before the first primary, and over a month and a half before the first official contest of any sort in which there was voter participation... the Iowa caucus.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.945" offset="458275">I wish to emphasize that this was not an application for time in Iowa, with respect to the Iowa caucus... which was, as I've said, about a month and a half away; this was for time from the national networks to be broadcast on those national networks around the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.057" offset="518670">And it is the failure of the networks to sell the precise time sought at the time it was sought that the Commission has found in the statute's language, unreasonable; even though CBS, for example, immediately offered to sell two five-minute periods of time during the time-periods that it was sought, and ABC offered to sell time in the first week of January of 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.154" offset="607068">The facts of the case are easily stated and, I think, not disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.456" offset="624309">In October 1979, letters were written on behalf of the Carter-Mondale campaign to each of the three networks, seeking to purchase a half hour of time during specified time-periods in the first week of December.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.430" offset="676241">It was said in these letters that the needs of the Carter-Mondale campaign were such that the time was required to kick off the campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.685" offset="709259">Each of the networks declined to sell precisely the time that was requested, on the evenings that they were sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.625" offset="736949">Each made a submission, first to the Carter-Mondale campaign by way of response, and then to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.077" offset="758787">When a complaint was filed there, setting forth their reasons, as I said... CBS made an immediate offer to sell two five-minute periods of time; ABC advised that it would sell time in early 1980 and prior to the time the Commission ruled, offered to sell time in the first week of January, 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.622" offset="824930">NBC initially declined to sell the half-hour at the time that it was sought, and when a half hour was sought in early January, NBC offered to sell it at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.994" offset="862441">The length of time before the election and the amount of potential requests for equal opportunities under Section 315 of the Federal Communications Act, and other requests for time were cited separately by each of the networks in their responses.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.754" offset="921478">ABC and NBC pointed, for example, to the fact that they had not sold national network time in the 1976 election until March and April of that election year.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.478" offset="964423">CBS pointed to the fact that it had already received requests from the Connally campaign on September 14th and the Reagan campaign on September 21.</text>

            <text syncTime="231.811" offset="1081765">On its face, this statute, which is Section 312(a)(7) is one of 7 subsections of Section 312(a) of the Federal Communications Act, setting forth acts that can lead to license revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.971" offset="1142370">The list is simple, of course I won't read it, but it includes such things as the making of false statements on the application for a license, the violation of cease and desist orders of the Commission, the willful or repeated failures to operate substantially as set forth in the license and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.182" offset="1211228">None of these imposed any new, substantive obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.818" offset="1229723">All of them imposed the risk of sanctions upon the networks or of the stations involved, broadcast stations, it was said if there was violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.007" offset="1262533">Our section, the one at issue today as adopted in the Federal Election Campaign Act prohibits the following: willful or repeated failure to allow reasonable access to or to permit purchase of reasonable amounts of time of time for the use of a broadcast station by a legally qualified candidate for federal elective office on behalf of his candidacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.807" offset="1365664">If the Court please, it is now the position of the Commission that the plain meaning of those words leads inexorably to the conclusion that ABC, say, which offered to sell time in January 1980 rather than December 1979, is in plain violation of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.674" offset="1569210">It's an appropriate thing to be considered then; the fashion in which the Commission has handled it is the fashion akin to the way its handled fairness doctrine complaints, which is to say, on a case by case approach, which we think is an entirely proper way to approach it, we do not object to the fact that when a complaint is made with respect to Section 312(a)(7), the Commission makes a ruling then as to whether the complaint is justified or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.289" offset="1663669">But I agree that if someone believes at license renewal time that there is a violation of any portion of Section 312(a), that's an appropriate thing to be considered by the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="400.888" offset="1758023">Our objection to what the Court of Appeals affirmed had nothing to do with the propriety of a complaint being filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.295" offset="1807656">Our objection is that we believe the Court of Appeals and the Commission applied the wrong standard in making its decision as to whether the networks acted reasonably.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.920" offset="1846108">So we don't come to you to say that a candidate may not file a complaint in front of the Commission alleging violation of what he says are the terms of the Federal Communications Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.578" offset="1904832">He may, and indeed that was true long before Section 312(a)(7) was in the books; that was true under the public interest standard as well, because if one thing I think is common ground between us here, it is that at least since this Court's decision in WDAY and really long before, it has been clear that broadcasters have been obliged under the public interest standard to sell some time to candidates and that it would be a violation of their public interest requirements if they refused to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.115" offset="2026980">Now there was a different standard applied under the public interest standard and that's one of the reasons that I'm here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.269" offset="2051535">But there was never any question but that a candidate could file a complaint in front of the Commission and indeed candidates did file complaints in front of the Commission long before Section 312(a)(7) existed and that the Commission would rule on the propriety of the conduct of the station involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1181.435" offset="4880179">But there's absolutely nothing the network can do, to require, for example, that these advertisements... if they were... if the networks have to carry them, be shown in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.342" offset="4923855">And one of the things that we said from the start to the Commission was... and to the Carter campaign... was, that if what you're thinking about is the Iowa Caucus, which is what's coming up close, why don't you go to the Iowa stations and seek to buy time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.686" offset="4981220">And it has always been our view that a very different kind of reasonableness standards would govern a request brought 47 days before the Iowa Caucus in Iowa, than would occur eight months before the Democratic National Convention when a nationwide broadcast is sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.481" offset="5052378">I would like to turn briefly to the nature of the statute as we see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.468" offset="5080381">And to start out, by saying this, I think it is common ground here that unless the statute significantly changed the public interest standard as it previously existed, we would not be here today and the broadcasters would have prevailed at the Commission level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.496" offset="5144433">I think my friends on my right would agree to that, it is based on the case law, a correct proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.317" offset="5175780">And so it seems to me that the first issue for consideration by the Court is whether Section 312(a)(7) in fact changed the pre-existing case law, and to the extent that it is asserted by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.910" offset="5226144">We urge upon you, among other things, the fact that this issue has to a considerable degree at least, been before this Court before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.198" offset="5271284">In 1973, in the CBS v. DNC case, this Court had occasion to analyze the nature of broadcast regulation and to go through, at considerable length, the fact that Congress had, in the Court's terms, time and again rejected systems of mandatory access.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.346" offset="5343904">The Court in the course of demonstrating that Congress had rejected such systems time and again, cited to this statute and referred to it as a codification of prior practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.237" offset="5395418">The Court had the benefit at that time of a brief amicus curiae filed by the United States and the FCC, urging precisely that position upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.509" offset="5432512">We believe what the Court said then, and I want to emphasize that it is not just the footnote which refers to Section 312(a)(7)... that we rely upon here, but the text and the theme of the Court's opinion there that we rely upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.852" offset="5485906">The Court had before it then the brief of the FCC, it had before it the statute and the statute was then brand new.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.689" offset="5517253">We believe what the Court said in '73 in DNC, about this issue was correct notwithstanding that has now been characterized by the Commission as a decision which did not have the benefit of an interpretation by the agency with the obligation of enforcing it, even though there was a brief by that very agency before it, and notwithstanding the fact that Judge Bazelon for the Court of Appeals said that the Court had strayed far from what was before it and had treated the issue in a cursory fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.458" offset="5632296">I do not believe that is a fair statement and I urge upon the Court the conclusions reached on it before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.362" offset="5659881">We believe the intent of Section 312(a)(7) is clear and that it may be found in the single piece of legislative history that one and all agree is the most important piece and that is the report of the Senate Commerce Committee which put this into the bill for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.640" offset="5729054">And they could not have made clearer that what Congress was concerned about was that in the context of the passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, which limited campaign expenditures by all forms of media, which was enacting a lowest unit charge provision, that Congress wanted to make sure that there would be no diminution in the language of the Senate report in the amount of coverage by broadcasters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.660" offset="5841067">The broadcasters would not then say we don't have to carry political advertisements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.112" offset="5862905">That was the purpose of the bill, was to codify the pre-existing obligation of that sort and it was to codify it and do more, it was to add a sanction in Section 312(a)(7), and that is precisely what it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.371" offset="5915986">What the Commission's decision does is, we believe, entirely inconsistent, not only with the notion of codification, but with the theory of broadcast regulation and of political neutrality of the Commission, as we have known it in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.048" offset="5970634">At the heart of the Commission's decision is the notion that this is a kind of candidates' entitlement bill, that this is legislation which leads, as a first question to what does the candidate want and how can we give it to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.356" offset="6023924">What the Commission has done is to say that one issue which previously had always been decided as part of the reasonableness standard applied in the context of public interest cases, that is the question of when to start selling time is not a factor at all; that that is a legal objective fact and that the Commission will tell us hereafter when a campaign is "in full swing".</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.375" offset="6135937">They have thus taken out of the equation which used to govern the whole notion of reasonableness any ability of the broadcasters to factor in when, except to say, we will tell you when the campaign is in full swing and once it is in full swing then your legal obligations attach and then we will apply a kind of equation of which the single most important element is the candidate's needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.108" offset="6246905">It is the position of the Commission that we, networks, and then they, the Commission, no less, are to get involved in the question of what the candidate wants, and to some extent at least, why he wants it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.702" offset="6301240">Now the Commission has tried, in the latter stages of this case, to retreat from that and to say that you can take the candidates' needs as expressed by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.891" offset="6341991">But the problem is that the opinion of the Commission and the opinion of Judge Bazelon below make very clear that what we are then allowed to say, what we are almost obliged to say as networks, is something like this: a candidate says he wants two hours to do a program on foreign policy, to express his views.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.887" offset="6422030">We are then to look and see if he can do that, a foreign policy speech, in something less than two hours and we are supposed to get back to the candidate, make a judgment, get back to the Commission, have a federal agency no less, rule on the question of our reasonableness in telling that candidate that two hours is longer than he needs to make a speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.235" offset="6507398">I wish to refer the Court to one of the cases cited in our brief, the Ed Clark case, a recent opinion after the promulgation of the Carter-Mondale case, where NBC... from my personal knowledge... was put in the position where a third-party candidate for the Libertarian party was saying I want 25-minute segments and NBC, trying to comply with this new ruling which we come to you today to seek to get reversed, was put in the position of saying we think 5 five-minute segments, plus a series of shorter segments, 30-second segments, et cetera, can accomplish your stated ends of greater voter identification and raising money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.593" offset="6660894">We never should have been in that position; the Commission surely should never have been put in the position of judging the reasonableness, and in that case, it said NBC was reasonable in saying that back to Ed Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.667" offset="6709168">That imports the Commission into the political process in a way it has never been before and we think that it raises the most significant constitutional questions as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.208" offset="6751277">If I may, I would like to reserve what little time I have left for rebuttal, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1684.464" offset="6892339">First, we contend that Section 312(a)(7) imposed a new obligation on broadcasters to afford reasonable access to individual candidates for federal elective office.</text>

            <text syncTime="2139.369" offset="8711924">Under the old public interest policy, no individual candidate had a right of affirmative access.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.672" offset="8733135">He could not obtain any relief from the Commission no matter how many times he was denied access.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.742" offset="8761452">It guaranteed no reasonable access or indeed, any access, to the individual candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.615" offset="8792903">It required only some political programming during the three-year term of the license.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.150" offset="8811085">The broadcaster was at liberty to pick and choose among the campaigns and decide which were the most important and which it would sell time to, and which it would not sell time to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.541" offset="8852672">For example, the broadcaster could determine that the campaign for governor in a particular year was more important than the campaign for a seat in the House of Representatives, and withhold time from all of the candidates in the Congressional race.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.265" offset="8903558">One need only compare this amorphous obligation with the very specific obligation imposed by the new statute to see that Congress was embarking on a new course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.554" offset="8944727">Under this statute, 312(a)(7), Congress has empowered the Commission to impose sanctions based on a broadcaster's repeated or willful failure to sell reasonable amounts of air time to an individual federal candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.548" offset="9000629">The words chosen by Congress focus in squarely on the individual: a legally qualified candidate must be afforded the specific use of a broadcast station to advocate his candidacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.455" offset="9052247">Under the statute, the broadcaster exposes himself to the ultimate sanction of license revocation if he unreasonably withholds air time on two or more occasions, or if he does this willfully on even one occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.298" offset="9107627">In short, as the Commission and the Court of Appeals both agreed, this statute extends its protection to the individual federal candidate, a kind of protection that was wholly unknown under the predecessor public interest standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.975" offset="9166350">In this connection the Court may reasonably ask why, if Congress really meant to codify the public interest standard why didn't it refer to the elements of the public interest standard?</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.432" offset="9212221">Why didn't it say that the broadcasters should review state and federal campaigns, should pick out the most important ones, should give air time to some of them and withhold air time from the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.573" offset="9256734">These elements of the public interest policy are simply not the elements prescribed by Congress in 312(a)(7).</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.077" offset="9286827">And the legislative history of this provision far from contradicting its plain meaning, strongly supports the literal interpretation that the Commission has given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.452" offset="9324234">Section 312(a)(7) was a central part of Title I of the Federal Election Campaign Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.106" offset="9350879">Title I, according to the Senate Commerce Committee, had two and only two purposes: it's first purpose was to give candidates, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.061" offset="9390690">"greater access to the media, so that they may better explain their stand on the issues and thereby more fully and completely inform the voters. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.769" offset="9433530">It's second purpose was to halt the spiraling cost of campaigning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.304" offset="9451712">Now Section 312(a)(7) doesn't have any direct relationship to the goal of containing campaign costs, but it does have a direct bearing on the goal of better informing the electorate, by focusing in on the individual candidate it goes beyond the old public interest standard and affords "greater access to the media".</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.484" offset="9536453">Congress' intent is also reflected in its contemporaneous amendment of another closely related statutory provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.590" offset="9568845">Before 1972, Section 315 of the Act contained a proviso which states flatly that there was no duty to give an individual candidate affirmative access.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.648" offset="9617014">The proviso read as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.898" offset="9626105">"no obligation is imposed in any licensee to allow the use of its station by any such candidate. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.670" offset="9657139">But when Congress enacted Section 312(a)(7) it recognized that this unqualified statement was no longer correct; it was necessary for Congress to make what it called conforming amendment, to bring Section 315 into harmony with the newly enacted 312(a)(7).</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.250" offset="9735506">As amended, Section 315 now provides no obligation is imposed under this subsection on any licensee to allow the use of its station by any such candidate.</text>
