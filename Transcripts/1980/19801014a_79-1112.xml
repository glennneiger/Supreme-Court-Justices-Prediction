            <text syncTime="1162.815" offset="4792698">I don't want to argue the preceding case, but we're not taking the position that either processes or machines are not patentable simply because computers are involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1177.731" offset="4852361">It obviously is not our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.666" offset="4876081">I think I've made clear our understanding of what the Court accomplished in Flook and the reason why Flook was here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.426" offset="4927072">The dissenting opinion in Flook, as a matter of fact, concluded with a reference to a number of pre-Flook decisions of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals interpreting Benson and referred to those as presenting the same basic issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.621" offset="5015888">In looking at those cases again and comparing them with the present opinion and other post-Flook opinions of that court, the striking thing to us is, how little difference there is in the analysis approach an approach being used by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.471" offset="5111287">Prior to the decision in Flook that court took the view that the holding in Benson was really limited to an effort to wholly preempt a mathematical formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.122" offset="5161860">The same basic analysis has been used in subsequent cases, although the Court does recognize that under Flook if the claim is on the mathematical formula, even though it may not wholly preempt it because it's limited to particular end uses then Flook does have to control that kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.988" offset="5245348">But the kind of analysis described in the portions of the Court's opinion that I've referred to in detail here, when it's used by the Board of Appeals, as we think it should be under this Court's decision, has been criticized by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and they have really limited the holding to those two basic propositions, that if the claim is of a mathematical formula or would wholly preempt a mathematical formula, then those decisions would preclude the granting of a patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.065" offset="5417651">Otherwise the analysis should proceed the way it did in the pre-Flook cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.281" offset="5434474">And that is what we seek clarification of in bringing these cases here today, because our understanding of the Court's interpretation of Section 101 in Flook and what we were asking the Court to do in Flook is quite different from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.009" offset="5501452">And the way the Patent Office has been administering Flook is quite different from that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1358.517" offset="5575431">Flook suggested that the analysis would proceed by assuming that the formula was in the prior art or was well known and then looking for something else that was claimed to have been discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.044" offset="5617540">Here everybody agrees that the formula for figuring out how long to cure the rubber was well known.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.167" offset="5638020">The... I forget the name of the formula... but that was well known.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.182" offset="5646066">As I understand it, the claim is that it was a new idea to realize that a computer could make use of this well-known formula when it was attached to measuring devices within the oven and cause this desired result to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.566" offset="5723702">I suppose they're claiming that discovery of the fact that a computer and the appropriate program will do something that could be figured out before is itself proper ground for getting a patent, which is a little bit different than the issue in Flook.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.020" offset="6621478">It does make some other products, such as O-rings, which are used in some other places.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.159" offset="6646033">But basically the process that we're involved with, and the whole purpose of the process, is to change this floppy, rather useless material as it stands, into a completely different state or thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.887" offset="6708936">And that is done by a process known as molding under pressure with heat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.025" offset="6733491">The fact is that chemicals can often change from one chemical to another just by the application of heat.</text>

            <text syncTime="1661.051" offset="6785632">But the fact is that when we come to cure it we run into problems, and our problem was that curing became mainly a matter of guesswork.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.233" offset="6838295">We have this equation, it's called the Arrhenius equation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1679.387" offset="6858983">He was a distinguished Swedish chemist and he received the Nobel prize, not for the equation, perhaps, but for his work, and this was one of the good fruits of his work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.961" offset="6905272">It's admittedly very old.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.774" offset="6908512">We could use that before, and we could calculate with or without a computer or calculator how long we thought it would take to cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.894" offset="6944979">But we really didn't know what temperature the mold was at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.299" offset="6962533">We heat the mold but molds have to be opened to put the material into them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.640" offset="6987924">So we'd open the mold and the operators would take different times to fill the mold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.826" offset="7004642">A typical cavity might have 64 or 128 cavities, all to be filled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.043" offset="7029511">It might have somewhat fewer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.948" offset="7037139">You close the mold and start the time going.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.743" offset="7052394">It may be at a different temperature from one operation to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.289" offset="7070575">A thermostat... there are two thermostats are on the machine, and when it reaches a certain critical temperature, the upper end of the temperature-curing range, the thermostat cuts it off and it begins to cool again until it reaches the thermostat at the lower end of the range and then heat comes on again, and it goes on and off, and on and off, during the curing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.498" offset="7159392">But what temperature is the material at in the mold?</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.965" offset="7177259">Well, we don't know unless we actually find some way of measuring it in the mold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.713" offset="7204218">And when we do, we find that it's at different temperatures at different times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.664" offset="7224071">Now, the thing that this invention found as a use for a digital computer is that combining that with a constant temperature monitoring located in the mold, but not at the cavity, but near the cavity, would enable us to get readings often... well, constantly, in fact, and to calculate them segment by segment all through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.902" offset="7340995">So when the mold's warming up, it's being calculated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.714" offset="7360221">That time doesn't result in very much cure but it has some and we know what it was at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.851" offset="7372760">When it gets up into the range it's calculated each time at the temperature that it is now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.631" offset="7399927">And this constant reading of the temperature by a, in a means that will not injure the product combined with the constant recalculation, not just a calculation... because if we got just one calculation, we wouldn't be any better off than we were before, to enable us to get a better product--</text>

            <text syncTime="1853.851" offset="7556766">The first is that our claimed method is a claim for a process for molding a precision synthetic rubber product, whereas, as noted in the majority opinion particularly the alarm limit is a number and the claim was directed in that, to calculating a number and then by some means or other which could have been manual simply resetting the alarm, which is a post-solution step.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.463" offset="7667212">In that case the only novelty was said to be the equation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1891.960" offset="7709217">We contend that the combination has been held novel by the examiner since he withdrew his 103 rejection on the grounds of obviousness, and he never did make a 102 rejection showing that he didn't believe that there was any lack of novelty in our case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2505.528" offset="10163473">Well, Congress at any rate thought they were separate and said that they'd split the statute in two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.354" offset="10190850">The Section 101 covered basically the classes of things which could be patented, Section 102 covered the novelty, and Section 103 the question of obviousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.022" offset="10229511">And I think basically that's what's intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.519" offset="10247483">I would say... you asked a question about types of inventions that do not come under Section 101.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.080" offset="10265664">There are many, many such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.142" offset="10273919">Methods of doing business, for example; sales programs; the ideas for books, or plots.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.670" offset="10312058">You can enumerate them forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.216" offset="10322298">There's many things that don't come under Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.449" offset="10343196">Basically, Section 101, I believe, was intended to protect inventors who came up with something of a physical embodiment, some way or other; at least a physical embodiment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.819" offset="10372662">Now, numbers are not really physically embodied even when we write them out, as digits, in the Arabic system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.333" offset="10398680">That's simply a symbol.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.270" offset="10402441">The number itself is still a concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.581" offset="10419682">And I don't think it was ever intended by any of the writers of the Constitution or the legislators in Congress, at any time, that people be able to patent their concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.685" offset="10464090">But when it gets down to having something that can be reduced to a physical status, whether it's a composition of matter as it was in Chakrabarty, under one interpretation anyway; process is under another, whether it's a machine or whether it's some sort of article that you can sell, any of those things, I think, certainly justify a patent as far as Section 101 is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.658" offset="10575999">As far as Sections 102 and 103 are concerned, examination is pretty strict at the Patent Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.702" offset="10612152">The product that we have here, for example, this little thing here, has at least two patents that cover it as a product, because there were two inventive concepts that were then physically embodied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.837" offset="10672757">That doesn't count the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.056" offset="10681638">We make other things that aren't patentable, or patented by our process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3035.065" offset="12281690">And the question that the Patent Office has been faced with, the question that was before this Court in Benson and again in Flook, is whether there's any limitation in the patent law on awarding the patents when you have a computer program or other sequence of mathematical or scientific steps that is novel and not obvious, and there's an attempt being made to exclude others from using it, perhaps for particular end uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.161" offset="12430066">And I want to remind the Court that in the Benson case the Court quoted from the President's Commission on the patent system, which said that the programs themselves were nor statutory subject matter, and, then, the indirect attempts to obtain patents by drafting claims as a process or a machine or components thereof, programmed in a given manner rather than as a program itself, should not be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.946" offset="12553155">And the reasons why that Commission said they should not be permitted were that reliable searches would not be feasible or economic because of the tremendous volume of prior art being generated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.862" offset="12600802">Without this search the patenting of programs would be tantamount to mere registration, and the presumption of validity would be all but nonexistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.905" offset="12636956">And the creation of programs has undergone substantial and satisfactory growth in the absence of patent protection and in the meantime copyright protection for programs is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.056" offset="12685648">That is the legislative question that this Court has twice said it is up to Congress to address, whether in whatever form and effort to get patents on processes or machines where the only element of novelty is in the computer program should be permissible, as long as those programs are not obvious or novel.</text>

            <text syncTime="3211.433" offset="12987101">What's puzzling about this case is, you rely on the earlier patent application to demonstrate that there is no novelty in much of this process, but they argue, they come back and say, yes but that does demonstrate that the process is patentable subject matter, because a patent issued on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.677" offset="13052094">And the only thing that's happened is, they've added something in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.270" offset="13062438">Does that destroy what would otherwise be patentable subject matter simply because they say you can do a lot of the operations in the process by having the mathematics done by a computer instead of a genius?</text>

            <text syncTime="3244.702" offset="13120221">The prior art shows that patents do issue for processes and for machines, and if Flook is to mean anything, it must be more than a guide to the drafting of these claims, so that there's always a claim beyond the novel formula itself in the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.833" offset="13212695">It must mean that the application is analyzed to see whether the only novelty inheres in the scientific principle or formula.</text>
