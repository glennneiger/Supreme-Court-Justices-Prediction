            <text syncTime="48.575" offset="344831">The issue before the Court in this matter this morning is whether a defendant in a federal antitrust action may seek contributions, and the threshold question we submit to the Court is whether the remedy sought here is one that is necessary to achieve the congressional intent of the antitrust laws?</text>
            <text syncTime="70.940" offset="434274">Will it further the congressional goals to grant contributions?</text>
            <text syncTime="75.735" offset="453500">In order to address the question, we would briefly like to just review the very brief facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.045" offset="486728">We are dealing here with a situation in which a plaintiff has filed a treble damage action under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and Section 4 of the Clayton Act, alleging a pricefixing conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.507" offset="556527">The plaintiff has sued Texas Industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.913" offset="562169">Identified as alleged coconspirators with Texas Industries were the three respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.534" offset="592680">The plaintiff did not sue the three respondents, he selected Texas Industries as the target and Texas Industries in turn filed a third party demand seeking contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.888" offset="650045">Now, although, in order for liability to exist to the plaintiff here, there must have been some participation by one or more of these respondents along with Texas Industries, the plaintiff can do what he has done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.755" offset="721516">He can select and he can elect, as he has done, to sue a single tortfeasor.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.956" offset="746385">Under the existing case law all coconspirators are joint tortfeasors and have been so for many, many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.515" offset="780553">Each, as a joint tortfeasor, is liable for the whole of the damages that the plaintiff can prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.823" offset="813781">And in addition, even if the plaintiff here had elected to sue all four and had obtained a judgment against all four, he could then elect to levy his judgment on any one of the four and collect from that one.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.441" offset="892253">In the absence of contribution, TXI, Texas Industries, cannot force any of these respondents to share the common burden, and had the plaintiff sued all four and obtained a judgment and decided to levy on one, that one in the absence of contribution could not force the other judgment debtors to pay any share of their judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="917.261" offset="3819534">But you're correct that there is, in the statute, there are some references to contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.228" offset="3847433">If Your Honors please, in order to determine whether contribution is a remedy which will achieve congressional intent, we think it's appropriate in the first place to actually first analyze the statutes, take a look at Section 1 of the Sherman and at Section 4 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.047" offset="3938757">And an analysis of these statutes clearly showed that they are penal, they are punitive statutes, that they're designed to provide both civil and criminal punishment for violators of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.979" offset="3998421">Section 1 of the Sherman Act establishes a violation, it defines illegal activities, and it provides that every contract combination of conspiracy that unreasonably restrains trade is illegal, and that every person, who engages in those illegal activities is guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.237" offset="4083475">And it then provides for criminal penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.158" offset="4095178">Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides that any person who is injured in his business or his property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may recover treble damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.510" offset="4148573">Now, when these statutes are read together, it becomes pretty clear that what constitutes the violations of the antitrust laws and the penalties therefore, and that there are really established two groups, those that can recover treble damages and those that are liable for those damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1078.137" offset="4463087">The difficulties with that approach is that at the present time all cotortfeasors are equally liable and if you approach it on the basis of an apportionment of fault, then you will be calling on the courts at that point to in effect referee degrees of fault as among wrongdoers and you are calling on each of the tortfeasors to attempt to show that he is not quite as wrong as the other fellow.</text>

            <text syncTime="1906.960" offset="7778339">That's one point in this argument that I'm going to readily concede.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.240" offset="7795475">I have attempted to do that, I've done it for what I believe to be good reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.612" offset="7817000">First of all, I'm mindful of the truism which this Court has often repeated that the business of the federal courts is constitutionally restricted to the cases and controversies that come before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.529" offset="7864648">And secondly, I've focused on the facts now before the Court in this case, because the Petitioner has persisted in asserting a value judgment sort of argument that equates contribution with fairness and no contribution with unfairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.896" offset="7942075">I find that theme has been repeated consistently throughout the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.349" offset="7959942">In fact, the last words Mr. Slater said when he sat down today, the last word he said, was "unfair".</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.704" offset="7985333">And I find that an ethereal theme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.875" offset="7998081">It's without substance, it's without standards, and it can't form the basis for rational decisionmaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.794" offset="8025666">And I have found no better way to illustrate that point than to see how contribution would work in the facts of the case that is now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.634" offset="8073105">Now, my colleague and friend, Mr. Slater, I believe, has given you all of the critical facts of this case, but I don't think he's really given you the flavor of the situation in which this case arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.269" offset="8123573">So if I might take a couple of minutes of the Court's time to go back over some of these facts, this case goes back as far as 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.046" offset="8158682">According to the indictments that were handed down in 1973 by a federal jury in New Orleans, a conspiracy took place among petitioner, respondents, and certain individuals, sometime in the middle of 1968 to about the middle of 1970, in which these parties agreed to fix prices on concrete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.381" offset="8256066">These indictments were returned in 1973; nolo pleas were entered by the companies involved and the individuals involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.361" offset="8295982">Since we're arguing this case on Mardi Gras day, I might point out to the Court that one of the individuals involved was a former King of Carnival in New Orleans, which is the highest honor that that City can bestow upon one of its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.383" offset="8392112">He was sent to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.370" offset="8392008">Another one of the individuals involved was the president-elect of the Chamber of Commerce of the City of New Orleans.</text>

            <text syncTime="2068.006" offset="8422519">--Well, Your Honor, what I am pointing out... the point I am making with respect to this is that everyone in New Orleans knew about this alleged conspiracy, and in 1973 a number of plaintiffs filed suit to recover damages against the parties that were charged with this conspiracy in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.138" offset="8507051">And all of that, as the petitioner points out in his reply brief, was resolved by compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.557" offset="8532755">And then, a couple of years later, in 1975, Abraham Construction Company filed this lawsuit, the original lawsuit which gave rise to this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.209" offset="8583328">And in that lawsuit Texas Industries was the only party sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.551" offset="8600778">Now, as Mr. Slater conceded in his oral argument... don' t think that there is any question about this, there is no collusion involved here... the only apparent reason why Texas Industries was the party that was sued by Abraham Construction is because Texas Industries is the party that sold concrete to Abraham Construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.104" offset="8682907">Abraham Construction concluded that it paid overcharges in the amount of $200,000 to Texas Industries, so it filed suit against Texas Industries saying, give me that $200,000 back, trebled, under Section 4 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.817" offset="8749781">Now, Texas Industries asserts this third party claim, and as Justice Stevens noted in the course of the argument of Mr. Slater, the mathematical computation that would be involved in working out how this claim would be resolved ultimately, if a contribution remedy ware allowed, would allow Texas Industries to keep $50,000 of that money it got from Abraham.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.774" offset="8869631">Not only would it escape all liability to Abraham, it would actually get to keep $50,000 of that money.</text>

            <text syncTime="2509.252" offset="10187560">I think the deterrence issue is a great example of the difficulties in assessing the policy situations involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="2528.478" offset="10264465">In accordance with prevailing economic theory the 5th Circuit said that businessmen are risk-averse; they are less prone to take a big chance of getting a small... they are deterred more by the slight prospect of a large loss than by the strong prospect of a small loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.920" offset="10370208">And that result comports with common sense, as well as prevailing economic theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.763" offset="10393614">If you could do as what Mr. Slater suggested in this case and seek contribution, you could in effect conduct a sort of cost-benefit analysis to determine whether or not it would be beneficial to you to engage in an antitrust conspiracy, and there could be many situations where it would be of positive benefit to engage in an antitrust conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.050" offset="10498731">I have gauged one possible fact situation along these lines on page 20 in my brief, where I posited a situation where one company controls 45 percent of the market and knows that under a per capita contribution rule it is only going to get tagged with a by-head share of any conspiracy.</text>

I posited 45 percent, but you could pick any number... that company would have a positive incentive under a contribution rule to go ahead and either force by threats or entice the other companies involved in the industry to join in a conspiracy, because it knows it stands to benefit far more than it could ever lose under those circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2709.640" offset="10989102">On the other hand, you have other amicus briefs that say that we need contribution because the present rule results in overdeterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.184" offset="11023270">I think the best summing up of the problem before the Court was made by the Court in the Olson Farms decision when it said, this is a complex policy thinking, that we ought to leave to Congress... and this matter is before Congress right now; there was legislation introduced in Congress in 1979 under which a contribution remedy would be created.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.690" offset="11129327">Now, Congress has not taken action on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.157" offset="11139149">It's pending on the floor of Congress right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.328" offset="11151792">But I suggest to the Court that that is strong evidence that Congress did not initially mean to create a contribution remedy when it passed the antitrust laws, and that the matter ought to be left to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.808" offset="11197768">Now, Mr. Slater reads Section 4 of the Clayton Act in such a way that he asserts a contribution remedy could be fashioned out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.489" offset="11248445">What he says is, that if you don't do that, people can get off scot free, and the rule was meant to punish all violators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.893" offset="11278120">What the statute says is that any person who shall be injured may sue therefor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.734" offset="11301422">It does not say, in accordance with Mr. Slater's analysis, every person who was injured must sue therefor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.918" offset="11334231">It creates a cause of action in favor of the person injured, not in favor of someone who has violated the statute and now seeks to either escape liability entirely, as is the case in this situation, or at least spread its liability among everyone that conceivably could have participated in the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.676" offset="11421271">I think there is no basis upon which, unlike the securities laws, a cause of action contribution could be implied from this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.951" offset="11462336">And certainly the historical background of the Sherman Act doesn't suggest any basis on which such a remedy could be implied from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.948" offset="11498280">But that point has been dealt with at some length by the Solicitor General of the United States in his brief to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2993.182" offset="12123234">The Court in its colloquy with counsel that have preceded me has pointed out effectively that there are many facets to this question of contribution, and that it can be applied in many ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.550" offset="12180703">The manner in which it might be afford lends itself to at least three analyses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.173" offset="12211214">One, of course, the pro rata amount, which depends on numbers alone; the market share amount, which depends upon how much was sold; and the other, the degree culpability, which of course, would require even more from the district judge confronted with this determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.571" offset="12292821">Whether one or all of these would be applied in some combination in a particular case doesn't lend itself easily to judicial determination, and is more properly addressed to the Congress, which has the capacity for fine tuning.</text>

            <text syncTime="3605.154" offset="14571116">"We conclude that fairness requires a right of contribution exist among joint tortfeasors, at least under certain circumstances. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.337" offset="14603926">"There is an obvious lack of sense in justice in a rule which permits the entire burden of restitution of a loss for which two parties are responsible to be placed upon one alone because of the plaintiff's whim or spite, or his collusion with the other wrongdoer.

            <text syncTime="3745.689" offset="15133271">But it seems to me that with respect to a civil situation where you have a specific cause of action conferred on a particular group of persons who were injured against another group who caused that injury, then the plaintiff should certainly be permitted to pick and choose whom he wants to sue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3786.502" offset="15296589">Their defense is, if they're not, if they did not conspire, then of course, there's no liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.920" offset="15326264">Insofar as the deterrence goes, I won't harp on that, but it occurs to us that, as the Solicitor General points out, the question of deterrence can cut both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.852" offset="15389898">Certainly the argument can be made that to cause a company to be exposed to the possibility of bearing the entire risk, entire judgment, would be more of a deterring factor than it would be for them to know that they could spread the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.906" offset="15474117">On the other hand, there is a much better chance of their knowing that they're going to get sued if there is contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.558" offset="15500762">Because if then, if one or two or three or four of the group of coconspirators are sued, you can rest assured they are going to make certain that the other coconspirators are brought into that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.039" offset="15546737">So it's a question of which is the greatest deterrent?</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.867" offset="15558022">Is it the exposure to the larger dollars, or is it the greater possibility of being exposed to a judgment?</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.113" offset="15582995">As a matter of fact, it occurs to us that the real deterrent in antitrust matters is the criminal statute, and that the possibility of fines and the possibility of jail terms to those persons who are thinking of violating the law is really the deterring factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.603" offset="15680902">And if they're not concerned about jail terms and they're not concerned about felony convictions and jail terms and hundred-thousand-dollar fines, they're not going to be concerned about whether or not their employer has to pay a whole judgement or a cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.176" offset="15731266">Insofar as the complexity question is concerned, we certainly... certainly, anytime you add parties, anytime that you permit additional causes of action, you of course increase the complexity somewhat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.794" offset="15813709">But the securities cases are complex cases, and they've been handled by the courts and the courts can sever, they can sever the claims, they can order new trials, separate trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.069" offset="15862819">There are any number of procedural devices available to the courts to permit them to handle whatever complexity might arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.457" offset="15892390">It won't complicate the plaintiff's suit in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.972" offset="15906391">The only complexity that can arise would be the increased complexity that might be caused as a result of cross-claims and third party demands, and we submit, Your Honors, that--</text>

            <text syncTime="3988.374" offset="16103982">Well, I don't think so because, really, what happens in these cases, though, they're long, they're drawn out, there is long, protracted litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.668" offset="16133239">They're very expensive litigation to carry on, and I think that most defendants find themselves in a posture of wanting to settle initially if they can, in some way, as soon as it becomes apparent that they're going to have some exposure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4012.067" offset="16198754">And I don't think that the question of contribution really is going to have an adverse effect, if you were to grant it, would have an adverse effect on settlements at all.</text>
