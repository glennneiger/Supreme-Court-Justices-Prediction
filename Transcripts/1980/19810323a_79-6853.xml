            <text syncTime="632.572" offset="2673931">It does provide a series of enforcement mechanisms for custody decrees and it's impossible to say exactly what effect it would have had on this case had it been effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.312" offset="2716877">Obviously, its intent is to provide an enforcement mechanism for custody decrees, even custody decrees that would not be enforceable under the full faith and credit clause because of lack of finality and other problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.270" offset="2768704">But, fortunately or unfortunately, we really at this point do not know what that effect would have been on our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.793" offset="2798797">After the respondent did not answer in the Florida proceeding, and after he had commenced his proceeding in Georgia, the Florida court did hold a full hearing on the issue, even though he was in default.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.421" offset="2877373">And at that hearing they entertained the testimony of the petitioner and made the following determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.777" offset="2906735">(1) They determined that Florida had subject matter jurisdiction in that the petitioner and the minor child were residents of the State of Florida and that the minor child's absence from the State of Florida did not affect his status as resident of that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.239" offset="2980609">Secondly, they found that they would recognize the Georgia decree and would establish this decree in the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.111" offset="3020106">And according to respondent and the amicus curiae, that's all they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.414" offset="3037347">But of course the record indicates otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.116" offset="3048109">The court went on and found that it was in the best interest of the child to modify visitation, not just parroting the petitioner's request for modification of visitation, but setting out a full schedule of visitation which really did in no way decrease the respondent's visitation rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.762" offset="3122715">And lastly, and really most importantly, the Florida court reviewed the other provisions of the Georgia decree that were in force at that time and determined that there was no reason to change any of those provisions, that they should remain in full force and effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.938" offset="3179453">And, of course, one of those, the major one of those, was that the custody remained with the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.908" offset="3203277">After the Florida judgement was rendered, the petitioner filed an answer with the Georgia court, or amended the answer she had already filed with the Georgia court and informed the Georgia court that the Florida court had already rendered a final judgment and requested in her motion to dismiss that, as we have indicated earlier, that the Florida judgment be afforded full faith and credit in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.643" offset="3306199">The Georgia court, nevertheless, held a hearing on the matter and as I indicated earlier, restricted the testimony to the testimony of the petitioner and the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.332" offset="3348935">After hearing the testimony of the petitioner and the respondent, it entered a final order completely in favor of the respondent, awarding him custody of the minor child.</text>

            <text syncTime="2448.236" offset="9936599">So that, what I'm saying is, it was unnecessary to get into the constitutional problems that you have in this case if the petitioner had simply utilized the provisions that were available in the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2867.887" offset="11615228">That's not what the Full Faith and Credit Clause was intended for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.625" offset="11630170">If you look at the new act, Section (d) of the new act, the new federal act, is designed to protect the decree of the original court, because it provides in that act that there shall be continuing jurisdiction in the court which renders the original decree and it forbids another state such as Florida, in this case, from dealing with an act, dealing with a prior decree from a sister state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.542" offset="11745840">And finally, I'll just mention, and I don't think the Court is of a mind to ever get to this, but if you got over the problem that the petitioner wants to get over, the problem's about not properly raising this question, you finally get around to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.087" offset="11811982">Then you get into this first class question of personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.272" offset="11828700">And under Kulko it doesn't look like the Court is going in that direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.461" offset="11853464">It would require a liberalization of what the Court said in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.346" offset="11873004">And we submit that very definitely there is no reason to do that; you would have to repudiate May v. Anderson, and the Court, in Mr. Justice Marshall's opinion in Kulko, cited May v. Anderson, so it gave the case a pat on the back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.939" offset="11935384">It didn't lock like you were getting ready to repudiate, because you recited it in that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.743" offset="11954611">And our basic position is, there's no reason to get that far and to get into that type of difficult problem in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.433" offset="11993376">Under this new act the issue may be back to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.002" offset="12007691">It'll certainly be in a different form, it'll be in connection with the new act, there will be no risk of the Court handing down an opinion which might conflict with the terms of that act, and it just makes good sense to essentially dismiss this case on the grounds that the writ of certiorari was improvidently granted.</text>

            <label>Ms. Mary R. Carden</label>
            <text syncTime="2991.918" offset="12111345">I'd just like to make a few remarks in response to Mr. Brown's comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.939" offset="12131407">First of all, of course, comity as we mentioned before doesn't demand full faith and credit and in this case Georgia did not afford full faith and credit to the Florida decree, regardless of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.746" offset="12178637">So no decision in this matter even thought Georgia may have not said, we don't think Article IV, Section 1, does not apply, the opinion still is there that Georgia under precedent of Webb v. Webb does not have to give any kind of importance or consideration to a final judgment of another state on the basis of that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.612" offset="12270065">Also, he mentioned the case of Halvey v. Halvey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.081" offset="12283962">And at that time Florida law provided that custody decrees could be modified even on the basis of facts that were not before the court at the time of its original decree, and I believe that was the reason that this Court had such a difficult time applying full faith and credit to Halvey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.375" offset="12357210">Since that time that law has been changed with the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, and the only possibility for modification does deal with a material change of circumstances occurring after the original decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.535" offset="12409768">One cannot go back and question the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.818" offset="12418963">Finally, he mentioned that there was, as he called it, kind of a rump hearing in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.141" offset="12444250">Well, his client, the respondent, was given every opportunity to appear and to raise any problems or any of the facts that he thought were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.246" offset="12480612">Obviously, the Florida court knew of the events, at least from the mother's perspective in February, because the restraining order was issued on the basis of the facts that appeared before the court at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.369" offset="12525125">So they... and they held a full hearing, the fact that the father didn't appear shouldn't give him the right to go to another state and file a new action.</text>
