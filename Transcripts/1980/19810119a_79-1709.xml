            <text syncTime="28.690" offset="206800">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.919" offset="219652">This case presents the question of whether consecutive sentences can be imposed for separately charged violations of two conspiracy provisions of the 1970 Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, where those two provisions were violated by what the court below found as a matter of fact, to be a single conspiracy with dual objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.297" offset="309200">The facts were briefly that following the seizure of a large quantity of marihuana from a freighter on the high seas, petitioners Albernaz and Rodriguez and 16 others were charged in a two-count indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.107" offset="360400">Count one, charged a conspiracy to import marihuana in violation of 21 U. S. C. Section 963.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.274" offset="389134">Count two, charged a conspiracy to distribute marihuana in violation of Section 846.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.688" offset="414734">Now, the two counts were absolutely identical as to the alleged conspirators, the alleged time and locus of the conspiracy, and the overt act set forth in furtherance in each count.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.897" offset="459561">They differ only in the object of the conspiracy alleged and in the statutory provision that was allegedly violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.264" offset="493102">From the outset, the prosecution triggered the two statutory violations as a single conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.087" offset="520374">Stating in his opening that the conspiracy charged in two counts is actually a single conspiracy, that at all times, the planning was the same to go find someone with a boat with reliable people to go out to sea and meet the freighter.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.623" offset="582545">And the Government's evidence focused on the petitioners' involvement in arranging to bring the marihuana from this freighter offshore to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.820" offset="619326">However, since the petitioners had enlisted the aid of Drug Enforcement Administration agents to provide the boat to transport the marihuana, the plan never came to fruition.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.114" offset="660494">The -- after some of the cargo was transferred, the Coast Guard moved in and seized the freighter and the petitioners and two others were arrested in Florida later that day.</text>

            <text syncTime="197.446" offset="881804">Now en banc, the Fifth Circuit reaffirmed this finding of a single conspiracy but affirmed the imposition of the consecutive sentences on the -- on a finding of congressional intent to authorize and a finding that there was no double jeopardy involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.097" offset="952439">Now, a number of recent opinions, this Court has stated that in determining whether multiple punishment for separate statutory violations that arise out of the same transaction are permissible, the first and primary question is whether Congress intended to authorize such punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.255" offset="1029030">If Congress didn't intend to authorize multiple punishment, that's the end of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.011" offset="1052018">Now, the congressional intent must be clear and unambiguous because criminal statutes must be strictly construed and the rule of lenity requires that ambiguity be resolved in favor of the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1737.991" offset="7043985">The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 was designed as this Court recognized in United States versus Moore to strengthen existing law enforcement authority in the field of drug abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.342" offset="7097379">The Act contains two distinct conspiracy provisions in two distinct subchapters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.811" offset="7119218">One provision, section 963, proscribes conspiracy to import a controlled substance and it authorizes a sentence of imprisonment or a fine that does not exceed the penalty specified for the abject offense of importation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.858" offset="7187450">The other provision, section 846, proscribes conspiracy to distribute a controlled -- a controlled substance and it authorizes a sentence measured in terms of the abject offense of distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.574" offset="7242307">Thus, a conspiracy having multiple objectives both to import and to distribute a controlled substance implicates both subchapters, each of which authorizes a sentence based on the punishment provided for the underlying substantive offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.199" offset="7312837">Notwithstanding, the existence of distinct subchapters with distinct offense and penalty provisions, petitioners contend that a conspiracy involving importation and distribution of a controlled substance in violation of section 963 and section 846 can be punished under only one of these provisions but not both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.336" offset="7401340">Surely nothing in the language or the structure of the Drug Control Act implies such a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.368" offset="7425477">To the contrary, the Act on its face suggests that sections 846 and 963 establish separate offenses that are subject to cumulative penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.097" offset="7472393">Moreover, our interpretation is also supported by the Blockburger rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.365" offset="7493500">As recently his last term in Whalen, the Court stated that Blockburger is a rule of statutory construction that has been consistently relied on to determine whether Congress has in a given situation, provided that two statutory offenses may be punished cumulatively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.952" offset="7563822">Similarly, in Iannelli, the Court said that Blockburger serves the function of identifying congressional intent to impose separate sentences -- separate sanctions -- excuse me -- for multiple offenses arising in the course of a single act or transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.811" offset="7631218">Unquestionably, the Blockburger test is satisfied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.376" offset="7645533">Conspiracy to import a controlled substance in violation of section 963 and conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance in violation of section 846, each requires proof of the fact that the other does not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2275.865" offset="9195430">Moreover, in the American Tobacco case, this Court specifically applied the Blockburger test to hold that a single conspiratorial agreement to violate Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act was subject to cumulative penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.561" offset="9250287">Here, analogously to American Tobacco, conspiracy to import a controlled substance and conspiracy to distribute that substance are separate statutory offenses under sections 943 and 846.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.857" offset="9303472">And the Blockburger rule indicates that these distinct statutory conspiracies are reciprocally distinguishable from and independent of each other.</text>

            <text syncTime="2853.333" offset="11505386">Well, one would hope that Congress would address the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.588" offset="11514372">Otherwise, it'd certainly be simpler if it had but I don't think particularly as this Court noted around.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.281" offset="11525134">I don't think it's surprising that there is no discussion of this in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.565" offset="11550317">Congress rarely specifically and expressly indicates its intent to allow consecutive sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.738" offset="11574976">Congress did enact the bill that has two separate conspiracy provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.024" offset="11592112">Those provisions do pass the Blockburger test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.743" offset="11606950">In those circumstances, the question is whether there's anything in the legislative history that defeats the presumption flowing from Blockburger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.462" offset="11645820">We think that the legislative history and particularly the events in the House that petitioners so heavily rely on are fully consistent with the position we take here in the resolution suggested by Blockburger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.453" offset="11693781">The bills that were originally introduced in the two committees were substantively identical and each applied to both domestic and international drug offenses, the only difference between the bills concerning the type of drugs covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.401" offset="11757624">The Ways and Means Bill was applicable to narcotics and marihuana which historically have been regulated under the Internal Revenue Code and other statutes within the jurisdiction of that committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.845" offset="11803391">While the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee bill was limited to depressant and stimulant drugs which previously had been regulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and thus, was -- was within the authority of the Commerce Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.242" offset="11864935">Later, however, and importantly, this division of responsibilities was deliberately altered in such a fashion that the Ways and Means Committee, which as I noted before, has general jurisdiction over customs and import matters, focused its attention on the international aspects of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.139" offset="11936615">At the same time, the Commerce Committee addressed the domestic side of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.497" offset="11958036">Thus, the ultimate relationship between the committees expressly and purposely emphasized the distinction between the domestic and international facets of the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.200" offset="12008818">In these circumstances, we believe that it accords with the usual presumption of rationality and regularity of congressional actions and is not contradicted by anything in the legislative history to believe that the Ways and Means Committee was naturally aware of and concerned with, not only the particular menace of drug -- drug trafficking but also with the Government's general interest in maintaining the integrity of its borders and in policing its boundaries against unauthorized entries into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.992" offset="12144028">From the outset, the legislation in the House consisted of two bills, each containing its own conspiracy provision and Congress in passing the Comprehensive Drug Control Act was unquestionably aware of the separate conspiracy sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.467" offset="12205886">Accordingly, the most likely congressional understanding was that under the well established Blockburger doctrine, cumulative penalties would be available for the distinct conspiracy offenses defined in sections 846 and 963.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.477" offset="12269938">At the least it cannot be unfailingly supposed, as petitioners suggest, that the existence of separate conspiracy provisions was a mere accident of the legislative process and that Congress never intended to authorize consecutive sentences.</text>

            <text syncTime="3149.672" offset="12690718">Petitioners' second argument to rebut the Blockburger rule, the rule of lenity analysis, is also unavailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.443" offset="12721752">As this court has recognized in such cases as Busic and in Callanan, the notion of lenity is one guy to be used in discerning legislative intent where an ambiguity otherwise is present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.036" offset="12776191">In the words of Mr. Justice Frankfurter writing for the Court in Callanan, the rule is a guide to statutory construction and comes into operation at the end of the process of construing what Congress has intended not at the beginning as an overriding consideration of being lenient to wrongdoers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.566" offset="12846303">In our view, the Blockburger doctrine renders it unnecessary to resort to the rule of lenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.640" offset="12870545">If as in this case, two distinct statutory provisions satisfy the Blockburger test, it is to be presumed the defenses under those provisions are subject to cumulative penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.478" offset="12917879">Indeed, the very purpose of the Blockburger standard was to answer the question of consecutive sentences in the absence of a specific indication of congressional intent, and therefore, Blockburger serves to resolve any ambiguity that might otherwise call for application of the rule of lenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.668" offset="12990708">Lenity cannot, by itself, be used to defeat the Blockburger doctrine and we are unaware of any decision in which this Court has found the Blockburger test to be satisfied and yet nonetheless relied on the rule of lenity to prohibit the imposition of cumulative penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.364" offset="13065523">Petitioners' counsel also relied on the fact that there are divergent authorities among court of -- the Courts of Appeals on the proper construction of these conspiracy provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3463.705" offset="13946790">First, it is our belief that the Court in its recent decision in Whalen did adapt the view that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar consecutive sentences that are authorized by the legislature and impose that a single sentencing proceeding following a single trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.215" offset="14008857">Since Congress did authorize cumulative punishments here, the Double Jeopardy Clause is no more offended that if -- than if Congress had enacted an equivalent statute as Mr. Justice Blackmun mentioned which expressly provided a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years for conspiracy both to import and to distribute a controlled substance and five years for conspiracy to engage in only one of the proscribed objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.261" offset="14109063">But in any event, even if it is assumed that there are some circumstances in which multiple punishments authorized by Congress could be unconstitutional under the Double Jeopardy Clause, petitioners' sentences in this case would nonetheless, be in fact, valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.135" offset="14160576">To the extent that the clause is applicable here at all, the Blockburger test would, as Mr. Justice Stevens suggested, furnish the standard for determining whether separately defined crimes constitute the same offense for purposes of double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.846" offset="14219404">And I think that is the phrasing that Mr. Justice White referred to before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.083" offset="14236331">Here, these statutes clearly satisfy the Blockburger test as we discussed previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.661" offset="14258692">In terms of double jeopardy, this case is no different from one in which, for example, the defendants conspire to import goods without paying the customs duty in order to obtain an unfair competitive advantage and attain a monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.223" offset="14320863">Surely, such an unlawful agreement could be punished if Congress saw fit as a violation of both the smuggling and antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.956" offset="14355868">Contrary to petitioners' basic premise, nothing in the Double Jeopardy Clause forbids Congress to conclude that an agreement to commit two offenses is more pernicious and should be more severely punished than an agreement to commit one offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.485" offset="14409993">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3585.569" offset="14434339">In that one minute, I would just simply like to say that we do contest the applicability of Blockburger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.996" offset="14464014">(a) to the conspiracy situation in general, and (b) to this particular conspiracy situation where each one does not require proof of the fact that the other does not, since you can infer the objective of distribution from the same facts that prove the importation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.360" offset="14537471">I would suggest that American Tobacco which is the only case that the Government has cited as a prime, this is distinguishable on the grounds that -(a) it was dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.949" offset="14583864">The portion discussing the consecutive sentences for Section 1 and 2 violations, and two that Sections 1 and 2 of that Act are very different from the conspiracy provisions here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.444" offset="14625765">Section one of the Sherman Antitrust Act I trust that is in a sense almost the substantive provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.557" offset="14646245">It prohibits a conspiracy in restraint of trade and makes engaging in that an offense, while Section 2 is conspiracy to monopolize.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.704" offset="14682816">So, there might be different reasons for saying that under those circumstances, consecutive sentences might be permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.560" offset="14714268">And in addition, it is the Antitrust Act which this Court has recognized and commentators, as well, has not been construed in the same manner that normal criminal statutes have.</text>

            <text syncTime="3674.228" offset="14788978">I'm saying that the antitrust statute has been given a much broader construction, a looser construction in terms of effectuating its -- its goal as a pro-competitive free enterprise statute and this -- this Court has, I believe, in United States Gypsum recognized that it has not construed the Sherman Antitrust Act and other Antitrust Act in the same manner that it can construes penal statutes such as the drug statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3733.215" offset="15024916">It's a question of this Court's having throughout its history, construe the Sherman Antitrust Act, differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.783" offset="15055113">And in addition, at the time of American Tobacco, these were misdemeanor offenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="3750.351" offset="15093461">So I'm just saying that relying on that decision to, as a general proposition, that Blockburger has been applied to other criminal conspiracy context is inappropriate.</text>
