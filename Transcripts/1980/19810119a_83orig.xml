            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="92066">The Court will hear arguments first this morning in case of the State of Maryland against the State of Louisiana, an original jurisdiction case.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.175" offset="176703">Mr. Sachs, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen H. Sachs</label>
            <text syncTime="25.846" offset="195406">Thank you very much Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.155" offset="212647">This original action challenges the validity of Louisiana's First-Use Tax on natural gas and its companion measures that comes to the Court on exceptions, the two reports of the Special Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.626" offset="262489">In his report of May 14, 1980, the Special Master recommended among other things that the Court grant the motions to intervene of the United States of the seventeen pipeline companies and of the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.262" offset="313062">In his report of September 15, 1980, he recommended denial of Louisiana's motion to dismiss and denial of the eight plaintiff States' motion for judgment on the pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.780" offset="355171">With the Court's permission, I would like to discuss the operation of the statutory scheme with particular emphasis on its facial and intended discrimination against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.166" offset="396654">Next, the Solicitor General speak to the scheme's interference with the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and finally, Mr. Peragine, on behalf of the pipelines will speak to their motion to intervene as well as to certain Commerce Clause issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.091" offset="452347">May it please the Court, this Court some 30 years ago, in Dean Milk Company v. Madison recognized that a state statute which would be clearly invalid which -- and I quote the Court artlessly disclosed and a valid purpose to discriminate against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.563" offset="526221">This, we respectfully suggest to the Court, is such a case and it falls even more squarely within this Court's recent precedence of Boston Stock Exchange against the New York Tax Commission and the City of Philadelphia against New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.139" offset="588602">Because, Your Honors, nothing emerges more clearly from the 115 pages of legislative history which you have before you and from the statutory scheme itself, than the compulsive concern of Louisiana to export this tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="141.993" offset="659968">Before you get to the so-called merits of the case, is it your opinion that Illinois -- Illinois versus Milwaukee completely overruled Ohio versus Wyandotte?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen H. Sachs</label>
            <text syncTime="158.004" offset="724020">No, Your Honor, it is not our opinion that Illinois against City of Milwaukee overrules Ohio against Wyandotte nor as our opinion that this case is controlled by this Court's disposition of the application for reasons of jurisdiction in Arizona against New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.154" offset="776579">Those cases, Your Honor, were not exclusive within the exclusive jurisdiction of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.752" offset="799044">Both the Illinois case and the Ohio case were cases within the original jurisdiction but not controlled -- not controlled by Section 1251 of the Judiciary Act, which gives this Court exclusive jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.819" offset="851289">Furthermore, may I say, Your Honor that this case is far from the kind of case that impacts the common law notions of nuisance as involved in one of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.203" offset="892876">It's far from the kind of case that impacts scientific testimony and scientific evidence that would have been required as Mr. Justice Harlan, I think, said in the Ohio case with Mr. Justice Douglas perhaps in the Illinois case.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.039" offset="944180">This is a case which impacts 30 states of this union and which test whether or not one state at the time of energy crisis can, in what we claim to be flagrant violation of the original principles of the Commerce Clause, can impose its will on other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.579" offset="1002381">And so, Your Honor, for both jurisdictional reasons, as well as prudential reasons, we think this case is radically different from both the Ohio case and the Illinois case.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.541" offset="1038221">And may I also add, Your Honor, if I may, that in Arizona against New Mexico, there is not the slightest suggestion that we can find that the suggestion of whether or not the states can get an alternative hearing in some other forum is in any way overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.684" offset="1106766">And it's worth to point out, I think, Your Honor, that here, we can go no place else.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.368" offset="1125470">There is no other forum where Maryland or her sister states who are plaintiffs can be heard and so for all those reasons, Your Honor, we feel that this case is quite properly here.</text>

            <text syncTime="291.548" offset="1258172">It was here some 50 years ago in a suit against West Virginia in which very similar contentions were being made when one state thereby, by simply cutting off supply, was having impact on the State and it citizens.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="304.349" offset="1309372">Well, but do you disagree with the notion that there is some tension between Pennsylvania versus West Virginia and Ohio versus Wyandotte?</text>

            <text syncTime="315.491" offset="1353989">No, Your Honor, I do not and the reason -- that as I do disagree with the contention that there is tension between the two propositions for the reasons that I began to indicate perhaps a moment or two ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.894" offset="1395576">We are dealing here, as this Court did in Pennsylvania against West Virginia, with a case that probes deep into the nature of this union.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.010" offset="1428073">I don't blush to say that here, two centuries after the foundation of this republic, where youre facing -- and we're asking this Court to face, precisely the questions of sectionalism, precisely the questions of the ability of one state to profiteer from its position in this case as a -- afford a supply of a very important natural resource.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.337" offset="1505395">Those concerns Your Honor, well, I don't need to denigrate the issues of nuisance or the issues of pollution or the issues that vex the States of Illinois and Ohio in the two cases that we've been discussing.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.881" offset="1547504">Well, I don't mean to denigrate those.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.564" offset="1554296">We respectfully suggest, Your Honor, that here, we are dealing about some -- with something terribly different.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.068" offset="1572268">This tax brings in to the State of Louisiana 300 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.538" offset="1586166">Let me be conservative, 250 million a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.139" offset="1600585">And Louisiana's statutory structure would give us, if we are successful, if we could get to their courts, and if we could sue in their courts, they would give us 6% on our money.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.690" offset="1638724">They are the kinds of reasons Your Honor.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="388.325" offset="1645307">Yet ordinarily a litigant suing on the basis that the tax violated the Commerce Clause or for some other reason was deficient constitutionally would have this case reviewed in the District Court, the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.055" offset="1740184">And if it is as important as you say it is in this Court by a writ of certiorari or perhaps one of few remaining direct appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.131" offset="1788562">Here, you have a Special Master and it goes directly to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.310" offset="1833284">Given the importance of the case, I would think the prudential considerations mentioned in Wyandotte might be all -- all the more important in that you would get more exhaustive review of your contentions in the ordinary litigated process than you would in the original jurisdiction type of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="461.636" offset="1938610">The first is, I know nothing in the law that suggests that exhaustive is good.</text>

            <text syncTime="468.365" offset="1965464">We believe that just as this Court found in Boston Stock Exchange, as it found in Philadelphia against the City of New Jersey, this statute is facially offensive to the Commerce Clause and as Mr. Smith would argue to the Supremacy Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="501.093" offset="2096389">We are not a litigant as appears in most of the courts of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.225" offset="2108928">We are sovereign states, and we are within the original jurisdiction put there by the founders of this -- of the Constitution for it to be heard precisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.804" offset="2143201">Because there was concern that to be heard in the forum of a foreign state or to be heard elsewhere, would not do justice between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.621" offset="2174548">And so, we are here because we are within the constitution of prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.195" offset="2188758">We are here in the exclusive jurisdiction because we're within the statutory prescription and we are here, as far as I can argue to you Your Honor, with -- on the right side of all of the prudential concerns, serious indignity of the claims, one of the -- one of the pieces of language that come, I think, from Mr. Justice Douglas' opinion for this Court in the Illinois case.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.597" offset="2278410">It's hard for me to imagine, I say, as an advocate certainly but I say as a lawyer, it is hard for me to imagine a more serious and a more dignified claim to engage the constitutional attention of this Court than this claim which harks back to the very primal concerns which were present when the Constitution was written.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.894" offset="2347583">And so, it doesn't need, in our respectful judgment Your Honor, reviewed by other courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.986" offset="2363988">It doesn't need factfinding by any Special Masters.</text>

            <text syncTime="668.450" offset="2765855">You can't read that and the 10 or 12 pages of the statute, without seeing and realizing that with the Louisiana legislature wanted to do, and this is not hyperbole on my part, it is theirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.354" offset="2813398">What I wanted to do was to make up for its frustration for years, much of which has been recorded in the annals of this Court and its ability to profit from the rich deposits of natural gas on the outer continental shelf in the federal domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.811" offset="2867210">And in an effort to do that, what they determined to do was to impose a so-called First-Use Tax on the first time this gas comes into the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.673" offset="2902737">That may have been bad enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="705.605" offset="2914440">We may have been here in any case, but they went way beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.987" offset="2927919">They exempted every conceivable local incidents of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.789" offset="2943175">The local domestic producers were exempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.423" offset="2953728">The local utility users were exempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.953" offset="2963864">The local commercial interest, which would take otherwise, take from the tax were exempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.143" offset="2980582">And what they did as one of them said, “If this tax is going to be passed, it's going to be a passed on tax, no doubt about it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="729.752" offset="3010988">And the history that you'll see when you read the legislative history was how that legislature was going to confront the problem of getting the benefits of the tax without having the local folks bear the burden.</text>

            <text syncTime="795.569" offset="3274303">They came -- they asked to be -- they intervened and their position and ours are certainly similar on the merits, ours and many commentators who have reviewed these matters, Professor Hellerstein among them have indicated the facial unconstitutionality of this Louisiana tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.718" offset="3338877">I'd like to address if I may, what we think -- the only thing that we believe troubled the Special Master on this aspect of the case, namely the facial unconstitutionality as far as discrimination against interstate commerce is concerned, what Mr. Davis, the Special Master did, was to say he almost did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.375" offset="3421529">You can't read his opinion without feeling that -- another inch or two and perhaps we would have been there, but he didn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.905" offset="3451622">And on this aspect of the case, he didn't because he was concerned that perhaps the actuality of operation of the tax would disclose that it had a bona fide compensating tax kind of a justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.305" offset="3509196">And with all respect to the Special Master, we think he misconceived two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.049" offset="3524242">First of all, the whole notion of actuality of operation, the phrase of course comes from this Court's opinion in Halliburton, but in no way, shape or form can it be said to be a call to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.366" offset="3581503">What actuality of operation meant there and what it meant in its -- in the seminal case of Henneford, the Cardozo opinion many years ago, saying that a sales tax and a -- and used tax can indeed be compensating was simply that you look at the way these statutes operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.252" offset="3641062">It was not a statement that you need evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.141" offset="3648585">There was not a statement that you have to have a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.149" offset="3656631">It was a question of looking at the entire statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.325" offset="3669274">It was not, I repeat, a call to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.602" offset="3678469">Indeed, in Henneford itself, the opinion -- the opinion of Mr. Justice Cardozo that -- that liberated this from some of the past -- it was an earlier avoidance of taxation by some management.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.313" offset="3725281">I say, what Cardozo did in Henneford was to decide a case with -- there is no evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.117" offset="3748477">There -- it is a -- its basic -- is a facial judgment he made in the Henneford opinion which makes super clear to us that actuality of operation is not necessarily a call to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.244" offset="3796961">And then the second thing that the Special Master we think misperceived was that there is a very, very significant difference between the sales tax, used tax, compensating tax analysis and the kind of compensation claimed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.771" offset="3863103">What is being claimed here is compensating in the sense of we don't like the fact that we can't tax OCS gas and we want to do better.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.948" offset="3899779">It's much like if in Boston Stock Exchange, they said we don't like the fact that the regional stock exchanges are outhustling us or out advertising us or drawing business away from us.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.853" offset="3943455">In that sense, one can say that the New York statute was compensating.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.893" offset="3959547">But as this Court unanimously said, that's not what compensating means for purposes of tax analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.313" offset="3981281">What compensating means as Mr. Justice Cardozo said in the Henneford case, in the famous metaphor there is that the dweller from within and the stranger from afar have to be treated evenhandedly, evenhandedness he said is the theme that has to run through the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.625" offset="4042512">And may I respectfully suggest to this Court that when you examine this statute and the legislative history, you will see that it makes a mockery of the notion of evenhandedness of what they did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.214" offset="4084830">What they did is every step of the way, read -- if you read no other page, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.985" offset="4103952">Read page 82C of the -- of the legislative history as reprinted here in our -- in our last filing which is simply a summary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.035" offset="4140105">It's only one line and it's not the best quotes but it's one line in which you can -- in one page in which you can see that they were saying we're taking care of everybody locally who could possibly get hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.533" offset="4182110">And when one state does that, when one state attempts to profiteer from its position for a rich source of national energy, when one saw -- when one state does that, it impacts, we respectfully suggest, the very concerns that led the founders of this republic to write the Commerce Clause and to -- and it offends the very notion of a free economy in an open economy and of comity between the states that the Commerce Clause is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.928" offset="4299766">When you read that legislative history, you will see this (Inaudinle)</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.217" offset="4312931">You will see how they are upset about what Montana is doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1061.331" offset="4337382">You will see how this is a part of a growing national sectionalism over how we're going to afford energy and who's going to pay for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.849" offset="4371446">And as I said before, and as I say in closing, that is precisely the kind of offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.145" offset="4396628">It is precisely the kind of parochialism that the Commerce Clause we respectfully suggest was quick to the Constitution to prevent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1106.053" offset="4516268">I think it can be stated with assurance on an examination of the Special Master's report and on the statute that this Louisiana First-Use Tax on natural gas is aimed at what is called OCS gas or Outer Continental Shelf gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.902" offset="4603622">It essentially exempts all gas for which a severance tax is paid either in any other state or in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.935" offset="4639775">It also was aimed in part on federal enclave gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.655" offset="4654613">That is the gas that is extracted from federal enclaves owned by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.023" offset="4684079">The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has, as the Court has said in numerous opinions exclusive jurisdiction over the sale and ratemaking over the sale of transportation of gas moving in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.794" offset="4751162">There can be no doubt that this gas is moving interstate commerce from the wellhead to the burner tips, the cases or legion that that movement is interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.592" offset="4802362">The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission objects principally to Section 47:1303C which is set forth in full at page 6 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.494" offset="4865996">That is the last brief we filed just exception of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.473" offset="4885953">And that provision states any agreement or contract by which an owner of natural gas at a time made taxable use first occurs claims a right to reimbursement or refund the such taxes from any other party in interest other than a purchaser of such natural gas is hereby declared to be against public policy and unenforceable to that extent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2034.913" offset="8231717">If the Commission put out an order allocating these costs, well, it's for the -- well, let me say and my time is -- I don't want to trench upon the time of the pipelines but let me simply say that the Commission -- it is not necessary to consider what would happen if the Commission put out an order because in our view, the mere fact that Louisiana has trenched upon the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commission, the Commission could agree with Louisiana, but that's not the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.460" offset="8345819">Louisiana cannot speak to the allocation of cost because that function is a judgment for the Commission to make and the Commission to make alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.098" offset="8392422">And to that extent, let me close by simply referring to the Court the language in page -- the language in Northern Natural Gas that we think answers this contention decisively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.000" offset="8444040">The Court said, “It may be true as the State Commissioner urges that accommodation on the part of the Federal Power Commission could avoid direct collision.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.472" offset="8477895">But this argument misses the point, not the Federal, but the State regulation must be subordinated when Congress has so plainly occupied the regulatory field.</text>

            <text syncTime="2142.102" offset="8660438">We are involved in this case because it is we, who buy the offshore gas, bring it into Louisiana in our pipeline systems, and take it beyond Louisiana in the most -- in most cases, just approximately 97.5 %.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.055" offset="8732223">We are the owners of the offshore gas as we bring it into the State of Louisiana and we are the owners when it is subjected to the so-called uses which trigger the First-Use Tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="2750.999" offset="11095991">It is the position of the State of Louisiana primarily as expressed in its pending motion to dismiss that this suit simply does not belong at this juncture and with the parties involved on the original docket of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.439" offset="11225767">There are innumerable jurisdictional standing and prudential problems that plague this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.966" offset="11283864">But the primary consideration that I think should control the disposition of the case is the prudential declination standard expressed in Ohio v. Wyandotte Chemicals Company, and more particularly, Arizona versus New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.975" offset="11391906">Now, Mr. Sachs has indicated that the Ohio v. Wyandotte principle, whereby this Court may in its discretion decline to exercise a case that is otherwise within the original jurisdiction of this Court where there is an alternative form in which the identical issues can be brought, should somehow not apply in that branch of this Court's original jurisdiction between two or more states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.759" offset="11579047">Now granted, Ohio v. Wyandotte was a suit under the other branch of this Court's original but concurrent jurisdiction as between a state and citizens of another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.916" offset="11659713">But if any question were raised as Mr. Sachs seems to have raised, that the same principle of declination in terms of the very practical and jurisprudential considerations set forth in Wyandotte, if there's any question that that -- those considerations apply equally to suits between two or more states, that was set to rest by the case of Arizona versus New Mexico, which is virtually on all fours with the situation that is presented to this Court today.</text>

            <text syncTime="4014.344" offset="16149431">But that doesn't go to jurisdiction or it might go to some prudential requirement or consideration as to whether you should cut off evidentiary hearings rather than go forward on a summary basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.055" offset="16236262">One of the best -- the closest example I can find of that nature is Pennsylvania against West Virginia where West Virginia had enacted the statute which cut off all exportation of natural gas from West Virginia into Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.462" offset="16321839">Now, the day after that statute was enacted, Pennsylvania and Ohio were in this Court seeking a declaration of the invalidity of that tax, of that West Virginia statute before it even became effective, which ultimately raised a good deal of concern on the part of Mr. Justice Brandeis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.819" offset="16419328">But nonetheless, the Court did take the case and did decide it presumably on the basis of the reading of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4092.368" offset="16461437">But what is significant even there was that the Court felt compelled even in terms of just reading this brand new statute to appoint a Commissioner who held extensive hearings in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, prolonged this emergency kind of review of the phase of the statute for some -- two years before this Court ultimately decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="4119.035" offset="16568122">And it utilized a great deal of evidence accumulated during those hearings in reading the face of the statute, and you will find that, much of that evidence in the initial part of that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4133.819" offset="16627263">But ultimately, I think these various problems need not be confronted or resolved, particularly these difficult matters of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4153.444" offset="16705839">It need not be resolved because of the overriding concern expressed in Ohio v. Wyandotte that this Court has committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.326" offset="16765294">The major part of its resources to the overwhelming burden that we all know exists with respect to appellate docket matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.951" offset="16815867">Now, the consideration, the vital consideration in determining when that Ohio v. Wyandotte principle applies is dependency of some kind of state court action that provides inappropriate forum in which the issues tendered here may be litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4211.205" offset="16936866">Now, as expressed in Arizona v. New Mexico, the emphasis is on the identity of the issues that are presented here in an original complaint with those that are available for adjudication in the alternate forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="4231.530" offset="17018159">And if there is an identity of those issues, then they -- that can be adjudicated and if any federal constitutional issues survive, the state court forum review of the matter, then of course they can be brought here on certiorari or appeal on the appellate docket.</text>
            <text syncTime="4256.263" offset="17117111">Now, it is an undenied fact that every issue that is being put to Your Honors by the plaintiff States as supported by the United States and the pipeline companies are identical to the jot and tittle with the issues that are involved in pending litigation in the state courts and federal courts of Louisiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="4406.366" offset="17717509">Now, let me add one other prudential consideration that weighs against continuing the case, this constitutional adjudication in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4419.156" offset="17768605">Let me say -- this gets back to some of the jurisdictional problems that Justice Rehnquist has mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4431.484" offset="17817924">In a real sense, once you understand whose real interest are involved in this case and they are the real -- and the taxpayers, the private taxpayer citizens are the real parties in interest in this suit, in this Court to obtain a tax refund on -- for their benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4451.890" offset="17899530">I suggest that they are not only the real parties and interest but they are indispensable parties to any kind of effective relief or adjudication that this Court had rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4464.091" offset="17948327">And yet they cannot become parties to this Court without destroying this jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4469.914" offset="17971628">Because once a private party is -- comes in as party plaintiff under the original jurisdiction of this Court, state versus state, and that private party comes through intervention but whatever the needs, joins the case as party plaintiffs then that would be in direct violation of the Eleventh Amendment which withdraws from this Court and every court jurisdiction over a suit by a private citizen against a sovereign state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4513.923" offset="18147694">Now, I suggest that there has been no waiver here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4518.844" offset="18167442">The State of Louisiana has never consented to be sued under the original jurisdiction of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4525.102" offset="18192415">I doubt if it would be effective if they made one because I think this Court's Article III type of jurisdiction over -- between suits, between states is not easily waivable by any state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4540.598" offset="18254378">But be that as it may, we simply do not have the real parties in interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="6182.556" offset="24822188">Pervasiveness across the State, cutting across all lines, it can add up to a parens patriae.</text>
            <text syncTime="6187.829" offset="24843295">It has to be something more than counting heads in the sense that the aggregate problem is greater than the sum of the parts, but whether or not you have to find out how many parts there are to make the sum, I think you can make a difference whether you're dealing with a thousand citizens or four millions citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="6201.941" offset="24899824">And I think the parens -- as the Chief -- as Justice Marshall pointed out in the -- in the Hawaii against Standard Oil case a couple of years ago, there is a recognized parens patriae role for the States to play on behalf of their -- of their consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6215.539" offset="24954159">I would like to point out, if I could, something of what I have to characterize the disingenuousness of the argument being tendered by Louisiana and especially the -- what I would characterize is the parade of prudential horribles that Mr. Gressman raises for you.</text>
            <text syncTime="6230.237" offset="25012987">There is something ironic for us to be told that we don't have standing when it is us who bear the tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="6242.970" offset="25063873">Louisiana passed the tax knowing and expecting that it would go the heart of the States who were bearing the tax, yet we are being told, “You are not injured.</text>

            <text syncTime="6254.000" offset="25107968">And I respectfully suggest to the Court that runs counter to every notion of the reason for standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6258.509" offset="25126045">Standing rules in the first place are there to ensure that the party raising the issues will indeed press the issues, that they have a real stake in the matter.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen H. Sachs</label>
            <text syncTime="6283.271" offset="25225101">No, sir, but the distinction here is that the -- the unconstitutional event in the first place, as your legislative history will show you, is that Louisiana imposed this tax, taking advantage of a mechanism, a conduits to the pipelines, a FERC mechanisms, all of which happened exactly as they forecast it precisely so that the tax would be born as we bear it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6303.485" offset="25305976">That, I respectfully suggest, Mr. Justice Stewart, must distinguish this kind of a situation for standing purposes from the situation in which every consumer always bears as part of a cost every tax as ever passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6314.568" offset="25350280">I think that's true but this is radically different from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6317.252" offset="25361042">I would like to respond if I may to a point raised by Mr. Justice White earlier with respect to whether Louisiana could constitutionally tax our processing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6326.525" offset="25398136">I want to concede that there are circumstances in which that certainly could happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="6329.982" offset="25411929">If we've learned anything from Complete Auto against Brady and if we've learned anything from the Washington Stevedoring case, we have been liberated from the notions that there are some automatic per se rule that says you can't touch it if it's in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="6342.870" offset="25463442">But what we also know is that a test must be applied and included in that test is whether or not the statute discriminates against interstate commerce and whether or not it is apportioned, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="6352.722" offset="25502939">And on this branch of the case, we are saying much like Boston Stock Exchange, and much like Pennsylvania -- City of Philadelphia against New Jersey, it is possible to say that facially, this statute does those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="6365.729" offset="25554975">So that we can live very comfortably, Mr. Justice White, in the universe that says, “Louisiana can find some tax that is not offensive to interstate commerce and it can oppose it on the thing called processes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6376.013" offset="25596040">It doesn't matter -- may I get back to what you've raised earlier, Mr. Justice Stevens, and that it really doesn't matter in this case and we've yet to hear facts suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="6384.395" offset="25629581">They are tendered or raised today or in all of the pleadings that suggest any fact that makes it necessary for an evidentiary hearing on this aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6394.204" offset="25668869">There is nothing about processing whether processing is or isn't one thing or another does not change the fact that what this statute does is to take every conceivable opportunity to export this tax out of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="6405.897" offset="25715576">A fertilizing company in Alabama is going to -- that takes gas from the Outer Continental Shelf is going to pay this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="6412.632" offset="25742535">A fertilizing company in Louisiana that takes the same gas does not pay the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="6417.582" offset="25762388">The utility companies in Louisiana pay the tax -- do not pay the tax on gas that comes from the Outer Continental Shelf, but utility companies in my case -- in my state and in New York and in Massachusetts, and all of the other states, indeed 30 of the States of this nation will pay that tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="6433.235" offset="25824977">As one of the sponsors of the utility tax credit bill said in the legislative history very candidly he said, “I just want to make sure that the folks in my district don't have higher fuel bills.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6443.555" offset="25866250">Well, all of us, especially those who of us who run for office would like to be able to ensure that that protection is afforded.</text>
            <text syncTime="6449.154" offset="25888611">But the Constitution of the United States says, “You can't do that and make interstate commerce bear all the burden.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6454.930" offset="25911704">And finally, what the -- the essential discrimination in this case and Professor Hellerstein, in his -- in his lectures in Tulane not so long ago points this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6463.567" offset="25946290">The essential discrimination in this case is that an owner of gas, who takes the gas from the Outer Continental Shelf and who has severance tax liability in the State takes the Outer Continental Shelf gas, tax free.</text>
            <text syncTime="6477.513" offset="26002087">One who doesn't do business in the State of Louisiana and does have those severance tax credits, he pays the full tax and that, may it please the Court, is precisely why the Commerce Clause exists to prevent.</text>
