            <text syncTime="363.127" offset="1598693">There was, particularly in the Case bill and to some degree as it related to Section 301(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="371.732" offset="1633175">Now, there was indeed some congressional concern about that, but petitioners respectfully suggest that the facts confronting the Court in this issue are considerably different and not analogous to Danbury Hatters.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.723" offset="1685106">As I understand Danbury Hatters it was a decision which arose out of a consumer or secondary boycott by the Hatters' Union against Danbury Hatters.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.197" offset="1730977">It's my understanding that the members of the union who were ultimately held responsible for damages may or may not have known of the actions of their union.</text>

            <text syncTime="406.619" offset="1772669">But by their association with the union the court held that they were responsible for the damages imposed by the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.614" offset="1844662">And therefore they had to go to the employees to seek the assets to fulfill for damage remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.935" offset="1865978">Congress was concerned about that and sought in 301(b) specific language which said that a damage judgment against unions is not to be held... the individuals are not to be held responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.044" offset="1930448">And we are not attempting by this decision to invade that, or this Court's prior decision in Atkinson v. Sinclair.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.898" offset="1961795">But we are addressing another issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.183" offset="1974961">Now, respondent and amicus, we believe, erroneously attempt to convert some legislative history dealing with the Case bill as dispositive of the present issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.529" offset="2056358">And in that sense they attempt to persuade the Court that the Case bill discussions, which did deal with the issue of discipline being the sole remedy available to employers in an unauthorized strike, is applicable to the Taft-Hartley bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.125" offset="2126785">And I direct the Congress's discussion as to 10(d) of the Case bill as the points in question that respondent attempts to emphasize.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.885" offset="2181746">They contend that this language and the congressional discussion attendant to this language provides a basis for the premise that Congress must have intended that discipline should be the sole remedy available to the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.560" offset="2240469">I believe these arguments avoid two very significant facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.479" offset="2260114">One, the provisions of 10(d) of the Case bill did not survive the Taft-Hartley and, in fact, show up only briefly in the early days of the Taft-Hartley and disappear inexplicably.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.856" offset="2309642">And we can't find out why, in reading the congressional history, but it disappeared.</text>

Evening News brings to fruition the ability of employees, ostensibly those same employees involved in this work stoppage, to enforce their rights under the collective bargaining agreement, and to bring an action under 301 to enforce the employer's obligation to them, whether be he terminated for unjust cause or whether his seniority was violated, but the employer is expected to comply with the collective bargaining agreement and if the union doesn't take care of it, the employee is entitled to under the conditions enunciated by this Court in its Vaca v. Sipes and Hines v. Anchor cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3199.062" offset="12942523">Your Honor, in looking at the legislative history, there was a congressional concern to avoid the repetition of Danbury Hatters, and as this Court recognized in the Atkinson case, that what the way the lawsuit developed was that it was only the individual employees who were sued, and it was only the individual employees who had a judgment against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.823" offset="13101557">And the $250,000 that the Danbury Hatters employees were sued pales in significance to the amount of dollars that are being sought in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.964" offset="13154115">Now, that really has no bearing, but, see, Congress was concerned that under Danbury that they didn't want to have a repetition of Danbury Hatters, and my contention is, with respect to that, is that not only in the situation where you could say conceivably it was the union that was at fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.550" offset="13268427">I think Congress spoke and said, we do not want to have a situation where individual employees would be responsible in damages for even unauthorized work stoppages, their breaches of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3345.175" offset="13650337">The reason that I feel that in 301(b) there's the language that says that if a union is responsible for a breach you should not look to the employees, is that that was the only type of remedy, monetary remedy that Congress was willing to allow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.391" offset="13650233">They were willing to allow a damage action against unions if they had breached the terms of the contract.</text>
