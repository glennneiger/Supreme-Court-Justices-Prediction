            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="144544">We will hear arguments first this morning in American Express Co. v. Koerner.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.837" offset="171816">Mr. Greene, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ronald_j_greene" startTime="12.974" stopTime="237.237">
            <label>Mr. Ronald J. Greene</label>
            <text syncTime="12.974" offset="196371">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.443" offset="214239">This case turns on what we view as a relatively simple question of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.281" offset="245586">It requires the Court to construe the meaning of Section 104(1) of the Truth-in-Lending Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.971" offset="276410">That section provides an exemption from the entire Act for business credit transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.141" offset="305040">The precise statutory language is,</text>
            <text syncTime="42.827" offset="315803">"transactions involving extensions of credit for business or commercial purposes. "</text>
            <text syncTime="49.647" offset="343075">The question before the Court today is whether this language makes the Truth-in-Lending Act inapplicable to the business credit cards issued by American Express to the company for which Respondent works.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.358" offset="405873">Now American Express says that the exemption applies because the cards in question were business cards, obtained by a business enterprise for business purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.166" offset="457177">Respondent counters that the exemption should not apply because he, together with his employer, was jointly liable for any charges on the account and because allegedly, on some occasions he used the card to make personal purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.812" offset="527708">Now, time permitting, there are three basic points that I'd like to cover this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.382" offset="550069">First, I'd like to review briefly the precise statutory language that we feel is dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.369" offset="577968">It is our position that this language clearly and without any equivocation, exempts all business card systems from the Truth-in-Lending Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.558" offset="614748">Second, I'd like to discuss the position that the Federal Reserve Board has taken on the issues before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.831" offset="647767">Under this Court's decision in Ford Motor v. Milhollin, the rulings of the Federal Reserve Board are, we think, dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.603" offset="682875">And finally, I'd like to touch on the fundamental policy considerations that we think are reflected in the business credit exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.542" offset="722686">And the Fifth Circuit decision which we've asked this Court to reverse is particularly troublesome because it reflects an insensitivity to these fundamental policy considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.952" offset="772319">And also, because it might lead to the imposition of an exceptionally complicated and convoluted regulatory scheme in an area where Congress and the Federal Reserve Board never thought that it should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.860" offset="827907">Application of those regulations in this area would impose wholly unnecessary regulatory costs in an area that Congress specifically decided it was not going to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.602" offset="886944">Now, there are no disputes about the facts in this case; it comes here on a motion for summary judgment that was granted by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.327" offset="925814">Mr. Koerner, the Respondent, was an officer of the John E. Koerner &amp; Co. In 1965, the company applied to American Express for issuance of a company card for Mr. Koerner's use.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.003" offset="984537">Other employees also were to receive cards; five cards were ultimately issued on this account.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.924" offset="1012227">American Express checked out the company's credit, and issued all five cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.495" offset="1034484">It also obtained Mr. Koerner's individual signature, and that made him liable together with the company for any charges on his particular card... not on the other four cards, but on his particular card.</text>

            <label>Justice Stewart</label>

            <text syncTime="290.119" offset="1305008">Are you suggesting that American Express was looking only to the corporation, not to the individuals?</text>

            <text syncTime="560.643" offset="2387104">And the creditor has to know, at that time, whether the card is going to be covered by the Act and therefore the disclosures have to be sent, or whether it's exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.135" offset="2429004">And the Federal Reserve Board has taken precisely this position in its newly issued Regulation Z, which came out just a couple of weeks ago, where it, in its new definition of cardholder, defines a cardholder as a person to whom a card is issued for consumer credit purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.804" offset="2551675">The question is the purpose for the issuance of the card, it's a prospective kind of test.</text>

            <text syncTime="978.124" offset="4056955">Because the credit transaction here was a business credit transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.295" offset="4081720">I should point out, that American Express issues two kinds of cards: it issues personal cards, and those are the vast majority of all cards that are issued; something like 90 percent of the cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.221" offset="4137413">And it issues company, or, corporate cards, which are the kinds of cards involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.959" offset="4160296">Now Mr. Koerner individually, could have applied for a personal card on a different application form and he... if he qualified for credit... could have received it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.766" offset="4207525">And then he would have received all of the disclosures under Truth-in-Lending, and all of the protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.468" offset="4230408">If he did not, the company applied for a business account, and then the company authorized a card to be delivered to Mr. Koerner and the four other employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.026" offset="4276593">That changes the nature of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.828" offset="4287773">The company name was on the card, the company received the bills, the company's credit was at stake; this is a business credit transaction and the agreement between American Express and the Company makes it so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.289" offset="4357677">Perhaps, if I... if we look a little bit at the particular section of the Act that American Express was charged with violating, you will see why an account can't be half fish and half fowl, why it has to be all business or all personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.221" offset="4445344">Section 161 of the Act applies only to open-end, consumer credit plans, that's the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.911" offset="4488185">Now, an open-end credit plan by its very nature involves a continual flow of credit extensions, as part of an overall credit plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.020" offset="4544609">Now, a creditor, in order to comply with the Fair Credit Billing Provisions, has to set up a complete compliance program to assure that the statutory deadlines, that are set in Section 161, are satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.048" offset="4612632">You have to respond within 30 days, and then within 90 days in specific ways, and you have to conduct certain kinds of investigations within certain time periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.321" offset="4653801">The creditor has to set up these procedures for a category of account, and when it gets an inquiry it has to know whether to assign it the deadline that the statute requires or whether not to assign it a deadline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.413" offset="4714196">The inquiry, the credit card issuer will have no way of knowing whether the inquiry relates to a personal charge or to a business charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.555" offset="4750663">In fact, it may relate to no charge at all, it may be a use... a charge that appears on the statement where the cardholder had never made any purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.927" offset="4792250">It might just be an error on the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.963" offset="4800296">Or it might be one of the statutory definitions of the billing error is a mistake in computation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.301" offset="4833733">It might be a mistake in adding up a number of charges, some of which were business and some of which were personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.020" offset="4856616">So, the creditor has to know, to comply with that Section, whether the account is fish or fowl; whether it is business or personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.792" offset="4891620">And in this case, this account was categorized as a business account.</text>

            <text syncTime="1219.347" offset="5021919">Section 103(h) of the Act confirms this reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.686" offset="5055251">That Section defines consumer, and consumer credit in the substantive provisions of the Act, like 161 that I was talking about a moment ago, use the word consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.629" offset="5111048">Now Section 103(h) says that consumer credit is credit primarily for personal, family or household purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.936" offset="5160263">It has the word primarily in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.305" offset="5169667">That, in our view, reflects that you can have a mixed purpose account, and that the creditor has to make a judgment at the outset, admittedly at the risk of making a mistake and then being liable under the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1693.887" offset="6920080">We sent a draft suit to American Express, looking for an apology which never happened, and then like, things got... really grew and grew and grew.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.559" offset="6950696">By the way, you'd be interested to know last week my father received three invitations from American Express to join... two corporate and one personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.248" offset="6985491">John E. Koerner &amp; Company was formed in 1907 by my grandfather, as a flower wholesaler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.252" offset="7013494">In 1965... by 1965, my father and his two brothers, both of whom are now deceased, were the managers of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.674" offset="7047140">In 1965, they made a decision to go to credit cards, company credit cards, rather than use individual credit or cash advances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.916" offset="7096146">And this particular card my father signed as a joint applicant, jointly and severally, or under Louisiana law what they call in solido liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.974" offset="7144420">And there was no restriction on the card at the time to show that it was restricted as to credit or as to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.495" offset="7178484">Now, there was no credit information requested of the individuals, but it is the policy of credit card companies to investigate the individual's credit reference in a closely held corporation, and there's no evidence in the record either way as to whether that was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.107" offset="7244939">If you remember Mr. Greene's response to Your Honors' questions indicated, I think, some ambiguity as to whether that was done or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.630" offset="7282973">So I don't think the record is clear, and if there's any inference to be drawn, it's... the inference would be that they may well have looked to the individual's credit background.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.854" offset="7323933">My father is well known to the Whitney Bank and the Hibernia Bank, and to the International Milling Company.</text>

            <text syncTime="1804.210" offset="7361341">Correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.876" offset="7363953">But it is very simple, particularly in 1965, to simply run a credit check on the mainly liable individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.880" offset="7392061">And in addition to that, if they didn't want some credit of the individuals, why make them co-principals and jointly and severally liable?</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.255" offset="7433543">Now, what happened is that eventually... one other thing that's interesting about this is that the credit card application was in 1965, which is several years predating the Truth-in-Lending Act, so what American Express wishes us to do is to look back to a time in the past when the Truth-in-Lending Act had not been enacted, nor had the credit card amendments been enacted in order to find a manifestation of the will of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.059" offset="7560707">In addition, what's interesting here is that during that intervening period of time in the '70's, American Express did send the company a... let's see, the method by which a complaint could be made and acknowledged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.520" offset="7634582">And that's reported at... in Judge Ball's opinion at 444 F. Supp. at 342, Note 32.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.358" offset="7661958">He... we did not contend that was an estoppel on American Express, because that wouldn't affect the statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.714" offset="7691320">But it is evidence of the will of the parties, that is, one of the only manifestations that the parties have made that there is some will that this should be... considered consumer credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.207" offset="7749311">Now, in 1975, because of lack of use by Mr. John E. Koerner, Jr. and personal use by my cousin, Ralph, and also the fact that Bankamericards were free and had no fee, they decided to go to Bankamericards primarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.751" offset="7823499">With regard to my father, he kept his business American Express card because it was convenient to use in Europe on European trips and on trips, whether it was... where Bankamericards were not recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.076" offset="7876789">Now, at that time, they sent two cards back but were never credited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.415" offset="7906151">In addition to that, there was flight insurance that was automatically billed to the card.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.403" offset="7930079">For a period of time that was a satisfactory arrangement, then it was cancelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.389" offset="7950036">They continued to bill the Koerner Company, for the personal... for the flight insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.643" offset="7979084">My father authorized payment for a while, sending letters saying, do something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.530" offset="8002595">But then it got to the point where he felt that it wouldn't do any good and that the only way to get their attention was just to simply not pay and send them a letter explaining why they would not pay, which is the procedure that is set up under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.855" offset="8051914">Now, in September of 1976, which is the month of the credit card revocation, as late as that month, my father sent in personal checks for personal business... for personal use of the card during that month or the preceding month.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.268" offset="8133520">There were numerous personal checks sent over a period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.572" offset="8150761">We did not submit an affidavit, but we did answer interrogatories in which we lined out some of the personal uses that he was able to find by going through his cancelled checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.463" offset="8202379">So, for a period of time, even to the same month involved, the checks individually were sent, by my father on his personal account for personal uses.</text>
