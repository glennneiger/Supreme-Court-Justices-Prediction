            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Gribbon</label>
            <text syncTime="51.866" offset="360579">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="55.485" offset="375103">A writ has been issued in this case to review the decision of the Court of Appeals of the 6th Circuit in which both in applying the attorney-client privilege and the work product rule sharply curtails the ability of a client to obtain informed legal advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.529" offset="447201">I shall devote the bulk of my argument to that part of the decision which limits the scope of the attorney-client privilege in the case of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.737" offset="484086">And thereafter I will briefly discuss what is left of the work product issue in the light of the Solicitor General's concession that the 6th Circuit erred in holding that there was no such protection in response to a summons from the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.247" offset="546153">The court below held in the case of a corporation, the attorney-client privilege protects only communications between a limited number of corporate officials and the corporation's lawyer, those officials being the ones who have the authority to act for the corporation upon such advice as is given by the lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.677" offset="631835">In so limiting the privilege the 6th Circuit associated itself with with the 3rd and the 10th Circuits and disagreed with the decisions of the 7th and 8th Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.885" offset="672690">Those circuits have adopted the so-called subject matter test pursuant to which the attorney-client privilege extends to communications between the corporation's lawyers and employees of the corporation who communicate with the lawyer concerning matters within the scope of their responsibilities for the purpose of obtaining legal advice or guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.500" offset="767149">The decision of the 7th Circuit adopting this subject matter test, Decker v. Harper &amp; Row, was affirmed here almost ten years ago by an equally divided Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.106" offset="813543">It is petitioner's contention that this test, the subject matter test, is more consistent with the underlying purpose of the attorney-client privilege in the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.116" offset="865578">Now, this case arises in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.734" offset="880103">Upjohn is a manufacturer and seller of pharmaceuticals in the United States and some 150 foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.589" offset="911449">Early in 1976 Gerard Thomas, Upjohn's general counsel, who is also a director and officer of the Company, was informed by the Company's independent accountants that there was reason to believe that some of Upjohn's foreign affiliates had made payments to or for the benefit of foreign governmental officials in the promotion of Upjohn business.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.003" offset="993160">Mr. Thomas with the advice of outside counsel and with the full support of the chairman of the board set about conducting an investigation to put himself in a position to render legal advice to the corporation concerning all aspects of these payments, including the possibility of civil and criminal litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.083" offset="1077484">The investigation that Mr. Thomas and outside counsel conducted consisted really of two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.654" offset="1099740">One was a questionnaire prepared by them which was sent to some 53 managers of Upjohn's foreign affiliates asking them to put down on paper whatever knowledge they had about possible payments to or for the benefit of foreign governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.164" offset="1161807">Each of these men was advised that his response would be treated as confidential and to this day it has been so treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.770" offset="1192214">Now, the second part of the investigation consisted of interviews conducted by Mr. Thomas and outside counsel of some 86 employees of Upjohn and its subsidiaries which had responsibility of one kind or another with respect to payments made in foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.397" offset="1266715">Some of those were within the United States and some of them were outside the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.283" offset="1282284">The interviewing lawyers made handwritten notes during the course of those interviews.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.253" offset="1306107">The record shows that those notes reflect factual information obtained from the employees as well as the lawyers' impressions, conclusions, opinions, and speculations at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.478" offset="1355009">Shortly after this investigation was completed, Upjohn filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission which described in generic terms without naming countries or specific amounts that there had been some payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.456" offset="1418956">That was the last heard from the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.891" offset="1428674">At no time did the SEC investigate or charge any kind of Securities Act violations on the part of Upjohn.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.062" offset="1453334">Now, a copy of this report was simultaneously submitted to the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.747" offset="1472142">Thereupon the Service commenced an investigation of Upjohn--</text>

            <text syncTime="337.186" offset="1501817">Upjohn submitted it to the Internal Revenue Service at the same time or simultaneously with the submission to the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.924" offset="1524805">The Revenue Service very shortly thereafter commenced an investigation of the tax years that were involved in this report and at the very outset of its investigation, before any witnesses had been interrogated, any documents examined, a special agent served upon Mr. Thomas the summons in question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.901" offset="1600769">That summons specifically asked for production of the questionnaires that had been obtained from Upjohn's employees and for all of the notes of interviews conducted by Upjohn.</text>

            <text syncTime="1092.100" offset="4521467">Now, the waiver point, the second point, was made by the Government below but it was rejected by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.690" offset="4551874">The second reason they have suggested for not getting to the scope of the privilege is that Upjohn by cooperating with the Internal Revenue Service and giving them various facts regarding these payments waived the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.663" offset="4599730">And to that one, the law is clear that it is only when you give up communications that you are in a position to waiver, and not simply when you give facts that may have been disclosed, may have been obtained, even in the course of an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.840" offset="4656468">But on that one the Court of Appeals did find against them, and there was nothing in their response to the Petition for cert which said anything about that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.427" offset="4686875">In that respect, the lower federal courts have recently in a number of opinions said that where a corporation or anybody else is voluntarily cooperating with the law enforcement authorities, that that in and of itself would not be regarded as a waiver of whatever privilege that they might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.824" offset="4760436">But, basically, the waiver comes down to waiving something that was communicated, and that wasn't done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.376" offset="4782587">I submit, therefore, that the Court should proceed to resolve this matter of the scope of the privilege which has bred confusion in the lower courts for about 20 years now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.334" offset="4822503">And while this case involves a corporation, I submit there is no reason in principle why what is decided here should not be equally applicable to any other organization whose structure is such that many people can act for it and bind it, but only a relatively few are able to make the decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.129" offset="4901601">Now, examples of such organizations would be agencies of the Federal Government, labor unions, fraternal organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.901" offset="4928769">This point is particularly emphasized in the brief filed here on behalf of the Federal Bar Association, which points out that agencies of the Federal Government will be handicapped in their ability to carry on if this control group test as adopted by the lower court is to be adopted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.363" offset="5002538">It's been generally agreed that the justification for the privilege is to promote observance of the law and effective administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.354" offset="5054574">It does this by permitting attorneys to gain and become fully informed of the relevant facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.341" offset="5082473">As this Court earlier this year in the Trammell case, in discussing the attorney-client privilege, said, that the basis for it is to permit the lawyer to know everything about the client's reasons for seeking representation if his professional mission is to be carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.033" offset="5145271">Corporations... certainly no less and I submit, to a greater extent than individuals... require legal advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.206" offset="5177977">Most of the business of this country is conducted by corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.758" offset="5192187">They are daily met with a maze of laws and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.979" offset="5209010">I would note that the interest of the bar which is shown here by briefs filed in support of petitioners' position should not be taken to mean that the scope of the attorney-client privilege is merely a convenience for lawyers in the practice of their profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.005" offset="5277138">If the control group test were to be adopted, I am sure there will be a great deal of professional frustration on the part of lawyers in trying to advise corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.546" offset="5315276">But the real losers, if that test is applied, is not going to be the lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.598" offset="5331472">It's the clients who need legal guidance, corporations, government agencies, and other organizations of that kind where the authority is greatly diffused and yet where individuals without authority can certainly bind the corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1335.075" offset="5493431">And what's going to happen if their intimate conversations with clients and from the lawyer's point of view, these employees, whether they're decision makers or not, are clients, because they are giving them facts that are necessary for the lawyer to have in order to advise the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.668" offset="5555812">Two reasons, basically, as I understand it in all that has been written about the control group test since Judge Kirkpatrick first set it out about 20 years ago, two reasons appear to be what come forward as the reason why the control group test should be adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.998" offset="5637105">First of these is simply that there's no necessity for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.050" offset="5653301">It is argued that corporate employees, unlike other individuals, will speak candidly, voluntarily, whether there's a privilege or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.722" offset="5687991">They don't have the apprehensions of ordinary individuals, or if they do, they will subordinate them to the will of the superior officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.614" offset="5727593">Now, I think one looks back at the privilege itself insofar as an individual is concerned, it probably never could be established that in fact the privilege is necessary in order to encourage people to be candid and frank with their lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.056" offset="5789347">There are a lot of reasons apart from the privilege which would indicate such candor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.075" offset="5805438">On the other hand experience shows that many people do not speak candidly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.912" offset="5832814">For a couple of centuries we have embraced the notion that it is helpful not to the individuals involved but to the effective administration of justice to encourage people, all kinds of people, to be completely candid by letting them know that what they say to their lawyer is not going to be used the next day against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.976" offset="5905017">So therefore, I think the no necessity argument really is without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.445" offset="5926855">It is true, as the proponents of the control test urge, that the employee does not get complete protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.300" offset="5962277">The protection the client protects, the privilege is not his, it's the corporation's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.104" offset="5981503">That is true, of course, not only of the subordinate employees but also of the management employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.608" offset="6003551">And just because they're management today doesn't mean that they're going to be management tomorrow, because the directors are not going to waive that privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.280" offset="6038241">The privilege is for the benefit of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.482" offset="6047018">But in this respect the employees are in this position of tension between their individual likes and dislikes and those of the organizations to which they belong, but it's not at all unique--</text>

            <text syncTime="1501.549" offset="6159345">--I think that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.835" offset="6164465">I didn't mean to suggest it was so abstract, but there are a lot of different people that are involved and ultimately, I presume, the shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.839" offset="6196439">And in some instances shareholders have come in and waived the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.541" offset="6211276">That isn't so likely in a big, publicly held corporation, but it's not impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.009" offset="6229144">And certainly the directors, certainly a new management can come in, so that on this ground there is really no solid basis for distinguishing between the subordinate employees who fairly frequently will have the facts that are necessary to give informed information, and the top management people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.454" offset="6294973">Neither group has complete protection in the way that an individual does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.339" offset="6310437">But they do have some protection, and experience shows that it has been exceedingly helpful in obtaining their cooperation and experience shows that in most instances the corporation does not lightly waive that privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.832" offset="6364458">It behaves as Upjohn is behaving here, zealously guarding the privilege of some 80 employees throughout the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.670" offset="6395805">The second argument that is made for the control group test is something in the nature of saying that it hides facts from discovery and it also enables the top management to close its eyes to disagreeable facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.947" offset="6456932">Now, as to the discovery argument, I submit, though it has often been made it is without merit, because the privilege does not hide facts from discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.887" offset="6492667">Indeed, Rule 33 of the Federal Rules requires that a corporation go on out and get all the facts that all of its employees have, so that if you work under the rules you can get all these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.593" offset="6535508">All that is hidden, all that is kept from disclosure, is the communication.</text>

            <text syncTime="1637.819" offset="6704364">And I was going to say that in this case, rather than hindering the Internal Revenue Service in its efforts, what Upjohn has given to the Internal Revenue Service as a result of this precautionary investigation that it undertook, has given them an ideal road map to the repositories of the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.114" offset="6773536">It hasn't given them the lawyers' analysis of the facts, or the impressions they had but it has certainly given them everything short of that, and in most instances that's one of the risks that a corporation takes when it embarks on an investigation of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.124" offset="6829647">Now, so far as insulating the top management from disagreeable facts, I submit that that is sheer speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.878" offset="6860576">There was no evidence of that in this case, there's no evidence in any other case that's been cited that that is likely to be the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.884" offset="6888684">It's true that the top management doesn't know all the facts of corporate actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.919" offset="6908746">But that isn't the result of the privilege or the lack of the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.871" offset="6920553">That reflects the breadth and complexity of the modern corporation's activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.375" offset="6938630">And surely there may be some changes in corporate governments; it's been under discussion for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.346" offset="6962454">But I would submit that whatever changes are made in the relations between shareholders, directors, public bodies, the public interest is still going to require that observance of the law and the efficient administration of the justice are best served by having a corporation get a full opportunity to have informed legal advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.842" offset="7044478">For all the reasons I've submitted, the subject matter test rather than the control group test stands the best chance of achieving those objectives.</text>

            <text syncTime="1751.092" offset="7157431">The principal question before the Court is how to accommodate the attorney-client privilege to the corporate form of doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.884" offset="7200690">Analytically, at one logical extreme, the privilege would not apply at all to corporations, because it's only the corporation who is the client and it is only to the entity that the lawyer owes his professional responsibility and the communications by necessity are with individuals to whom the lawyer does not owe this kind of fiduciary responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.319" offset="7314375">We do not advocate this approach to it, but this is one analytical, logical extreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.140" offset="7341647">At the other logical extreme, all communications between an attorney for the entity and any employee of the entity would be privileged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.250" offset="7398071">Because the entity can communicate only through its employees, this would result in a much more expansive scope of the privilege in the corporate form of doing business than what we understand the privilege to be with respect to employees of a proprietorship or of a partnership and indeed, what the Court in Hickman v. Taylor understood the scope of the privilege to be with respect to employees of a partnership.</text>

            <text syncTime="1858.112" offset="7585526">I really planned to get to that a little bit later on, but there's a difference between acting as an agent and communicating what the client knows and wishes to communicate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2863.041" offset="11605249">And the first thing that the Court of Appeals recognizes is that criticism of the control group test usually begins with the observation that in the corporate setting the people who know the relevant facts and the people who make the decisions are seldom the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="2902.767" offset="11764178">"The confidentiality offered to non-control group employees would be quite illusory from their standpoint, because they have no control over the privilege itself. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2958.769" offset="11988204">Now, this seems to us to be directly relevant to the usual approach of trying to determine whether a substantial and weighty competing interest requires a privilege to be more broadly construed than its applicability to those who have the authority to seek the advice of counsel, to act on the advice that is sought, and indeed to waive the privilege.</text>
