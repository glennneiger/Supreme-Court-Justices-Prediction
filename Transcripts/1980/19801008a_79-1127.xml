            <text syncTime="2938.021" offset="11905668">You'll find at least one inference on page 33 of the Appendix, towards the end of the examination, where Dr. Grigson on his own volunteered some statements that Mr. Smith had allegedly made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.534" offset="11947673">But, apart from that, the doctor drew all of his diagnosis from Smith's comments, from what Smith said to him, and apparently from what Smith supposedly did not say to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3202.633" offset="12964045">He had defended William David Hovila a month before in Dallas County and Dr. Grigson had testified during Hovila's trial as to sociopathic personality features, although there had been an issue of sanity raised in that trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.940" offset="13013260">Still, Dr. Grigson had given testimony extremely similar to the testimony given in the Smith case and was cross-examined by this same trial counsel one month previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.983" offset="13053488">Further, he said the defendant himself knew he had been examined by Dr. Grigson, and surely told his counsel that the psychiatrist had talked to him, but there is no showing in the record that the defendant had given that information to counsel; I'm making an assumption from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.555" offset="13131751">These are some of the reasons the State feels that a full evidentiary hearing should have been conducted as to the issue of due process and surprise in order to have all of the facts in the record, to give the State an opportunity to cross-examine the defense attorney as to his statements in his affidavit, for many statements could not be disproven any other way than on cross-examination from him from the witness stand.</text>
