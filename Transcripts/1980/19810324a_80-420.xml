            <text syncTime="1652.879" offset="6703540">Because basically, what could happen in any selective prosecution across the country, a prosecutor could simply come in and say,” One, we never intended to discriminate against this defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1687.817" offset="6843243">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.048" offset="6856200">I first would like to make a comment on jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.881" offset="6875531">Although usually the state prosecutors who appear in the federal courts whether it be this Court or district courts, commonly 1983 actions, the state is usually in reluctance to submit to federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.684" offset="6930701">However, I think that the procedural aspect of this case makes it different than other types of cases where this Court has determined whether or not the finality rule is subject to an exception bringing a case up here that is interlocutory in nature or whether there are further procedures which can be happening in the lower court on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.602" offset="7022443">The difference is that in this case, we have a prosecutor's appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.414" offset="7041669">We have brought Larry Flynt and his brother and his wife here against their will, as it were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.540" offset="7062149">There should be a distinction made by this Court in determining jurisdiction between cases where the prosecutor loses in the Trial Court on his motion to dismiss for selective prosecution as it is in double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.385" offset="7125575">On the contrary, the cases where the defendant wins his motion and the prosecutor appeals, his -- the prosecutor has the right to appeal by statute in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.971" offset="7155877">We have to ask leave of court from the Court of Appeals and then it can go further to the supreme court of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.492" offset="7177924">One of the requirements of 1257 is at it be that the -- a final of judgment or decree of the highest court of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.088" offset="7208331">Therefore, when you talk about a final decree, the Supreme Court of Ohio, has in effect, taken a ruling which in a trial court level applied only to Larry Flynt and his brother and his wife, and has broadened it into a statewide policy, cementing in stone the rule of law in Ohio as the Supreme Court of Ohio cedes your decisions on selective enforcement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2137.894" offset="8643602">And what I meant to ask the Court is that you take note that by saying that you can supervise early, decide whether the Supreme Court of Ohio correctly announced the law and that should not be construed by this Court or Other courts -- then that gives a defendant a correlative right to a pretrial collateral appeal if he loses his motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.456" offset="8721865">And if the trial judge says, “No, you have to stand trial because you were not selectively enforced,” that should not give rise to an appeal by him before trial, such as it was just decided by the Ninth Circuit in the U.S. versus Wilson case just last month.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.934" offset="8771707">And the U.S. Ninth Circuit has extended this Court's decision in Abney which said that double jeopardy is a pretrial appeal to vindictive prosecutions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2182.629" offset="8822489">And I think that this Court should be wary of the distinction, and that's the only point I meant to make on jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2198.902" offset="8887586">A defendant losing his motion at trial is governed by that case rather than Abney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.542" offset="8906185">Abney was decided because of the peculiarity of the double jeopardy history and because of the significance of that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.577" offset="8930322">I don't think selective prosecution or vindictive prosecution or -- or losing any evidence question or motion to suppress should be allowed given the defendant's right to a pretrial appeal.But since that could be -- if the Court is going to deal with jurisdiction, I wish that it take a distinction between when a prosecutor has the right to appeal and you are merely supervising whether or not the Supreme Court of Ohio made the correct decision, and one where you're saying all selective prosecution cases have -- give rise to a direct appeal or right of certiorari grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.703" offset="9038783">Now, as far as the merits of the case which is, I think, the allegations before us, the motive of the prosecutor, I think, is -- is important when it's clear on the facts of the record that the prosecutor is vindictive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.815" offset="9107224">If the prosecutor in Cameron versus Johnson for instance had enforce the new anti-picketing statute that was passed while the people were picketing the court house and he had picked out the guy to be arrested, he'd sent the cops after the guy that wasn't the leader, then I think he'd have been in trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.695" offset="9166783">But since he -- they passed the new ordinance and statute and he enforced it, generally, this Court said, “Well it's a new statute, we've got to test it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.771" offset="9199070">And you can't say that it's invidious until you have a course of conduct.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.692" offset="9214744">I think that the course of conduct requirements, were this court has said that you must prove that something happens over and over again are important because as this court stated in Sunday Lake Iron, which is a good example of a selective prosecution case, practically, uniformity is the aim of the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.389" offset="9285588">And the emphasis, I think, is impractical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.694" offset="9294783">And I think that the issue on this case is important to us because there are two types of crimes that we must deal within the cities now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.414" offset="9325607">Those are the cases that come to us and we have no discretion to deny or to prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.114" offset="9344415">Murders or robberies or assault, those kinds of crimes which happen, and then there are people arrested, we have to take those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.515" offset="9370015">The cases we have to martial our resources and decide what to with are what we call ”discretionary cases”, you know, the organized criminal activity that's ongoing, everybody knows about it, it's flagrantly done like I'd said, any prostitution, gambling, white collar crime, those kinds of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.413" offset="9433650">Where you know there's people violating the law and you have to decide what to do about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2767.356" offset="11161389">They said -- in effect, they decided the factual issue, “Yes, this is not a prima facie case, the prosecutor did not discriminate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2776.020" offset="11196079">And I think that this Court is bound by that portion of the Supreme Court of Ohio's ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.106" offset="11212380">In cases like Ward versus Illinois and Michigan versus New York and some other cases, this Court has said you are bound by decisions of the State Court unless clearly, you're erroneous or violative of some other provision of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.471" offset="11261908">I think that what this Court should -- could zero in on is whether or not the Supreme Court of Ohio announced the proper rule of law, because that is a general pronouncement in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.122" offset="11296494">But whether or not the Supreme Court of Ohio correctly reviewed the facts, they really didn't, they affirmed the Court of Appeals who reviewed the facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2822.486" offset="11381966">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.I would like primarily to address the merits of petitioner's selective prosecution claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.862" offset="11411433">But as I pointed out in our amicus curiae brief, we believe that the Court lacks jurisdiction under Section 1257 to hear this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.474" offset="11453855">This case is different than Cox Broadcasting and some other cases, this cases falls into this morning's decision at San Diego Electric and the long line of cases including Albas, Republic Gas Company, Radio Station WOW, Cox Broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.344" offset="11517385">Dictum would say that where there are other federal issues pending to be determined on the remand, then it would highly inappropriate for this Court to take jurisdiction of the case which could come back again after all the federal issues have been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.500" offset="11574019">As been pointed out in Mr. Justice Rehnquist's comments, the decision below, the trial will produce other federal questions if petitioners are convictive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.845" offset="11615397">Of course if they are acquitted, this Court would never have to reach the selective prosecution claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.856" offset="11635459">And for those reasons, we believe that the -- that the decision is not final, within the meaning of 1257.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.194" offset="11664820">Now, I would like to make one other point, or two other points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.410" offset="11681643">First, some of the decisions like Cox Broadcasting and Miami Herald, which have stretched the concept of finality to some extent have done so on the basis, I think, that was pressing First Amendment issue which affect a lot of the press as a whole and the public as a whole, and there were really no other federal issues to be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.438" offset="11757712">And therefore, it wasn't imperative that the decision be made at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.297" offset="11773176">A selective prosecution claimant, a petitioner of selective prosecution claim is, by definition, very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.399" offset="11793552">It only affects a historical fact in these petitioners, by definition, is not affecting the other members of the press because under their claim, the State of Ohio has failed to prosecute under members of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.666" offset="11834616">Therefore it seems, you know, completely inappropriate for the Court to try to spread some jurisdictional provisions, and I think that the Court should dismiss the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.295" offset="11869202">My brother did point out one other matter of great concern on the jurisdiction was to us, and that is the Ninth Circuit's recent decision in Wilson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.042" offset="11900131">That decision held that a district court's denial of a selective prosecution claim while at trial was immediately appealable by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.579" offset="11930329">Now, that is going to cause havoc with the criminal justice system because any defendant could come in and make a selective prosecution claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.894" offset="11959586">And if he's denied at hearing or he's denied on the merits, then he can simply take an appeal, it's much different than Abney double jeopardy claims, also the Equal Protection Clauses I have at history --</text>

            <text syncTime="2989.502" offset="12049970">And -- and if the Court would like, we'd be willing to submit a post-argument brief in short order on this point if it would be any use to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.228" offset="12080899">Turning to the merits, the trial court held as a matter law that where there is a test case, where there is one defendant among similarly situated other defendants and a prosecution of law only against the one, but that is legally insufficient, there were not factual findings as -- as the Ohio Supreme Court noted on the footnote at the end of it's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.951" offset="12183821">There -- there were no factual findings by the trial court about bad faith, bad motives, cartoons, anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.892" offset="12215586">It simply stated that it was legally insufficient to have a test case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.087" offset="12236380">Now, my brother Mr. Fahringer has sort of waffled in his point this morning, but in his reply writ at page five, he concedes now begrudgingly that a test case is an appropriate as prosecutorial stratagem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.241" offset="12284967">That concession is well warranted in light of this decision -- this Court's decisions on Mackay Telegraph, Moog Industries and Universal-Rundle Corp, which were all cited in the briefs, as well as many other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.294" offset="12329166">Where there are just numerous defendants similarly situated and the prosecutor lacks resources to prosecute all, or where the law is at some question whether there is -- whether the laws can be applied to a particular kind of situation or particular kind of defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3179.669" offset="12810655">If we do, I think that the prosecutor's testimony at the hearing overwhelmingly shows that the decision to prosecute was made on various rational factors, including his view that Hustler has more obscene, the fact that was a more notorious violator of the law, the fact that was in-state and even if you could get extradition over these other out-of-state publishers, there was no need for Cleveland to expend that additional money in bringing a test case to pick the most difficult to prosecute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3507.300" offset="14121166">"For purpose of this motion, the Court is limited by the testimony and must search that testimony objectively in relationship to the constitutional guidelines established by a series of previous judicial decisions on the discriminatory prosecution question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3561.608" offset="14338401">Last, let me just say this, if it is part of the reason, if the First Amendment implications are part of the reason for prosecuting the magazine, then it seems to me there has to be a much more in-depth inquiry than we had here as to whether or not this is a test case or not.</text>
