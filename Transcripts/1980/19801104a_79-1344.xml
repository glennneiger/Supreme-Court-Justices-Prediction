            <text syncTime="17.603" offset="220694">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="19.493" offset="228321">My name is Gregory Jilka.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.929" offset="234068">I am one of the attorneys for Michael M., a 17-year old California youth who comes before this Court seeking reversal of the judgment of the Supreme Court of California, a judgment which upheld the validity, the constitutional validity of California Penal Code Section 261.5, on equal protection grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.671" offset="321004">In oral argument this morning, I propose first to outline the issue in its procedural posture; secondly, to discuss the purposes and to assert the purposes of the statute and thirdly, to discuss the so-called pregnancy prevention rationale and as to whether or not it really diminishes the criminal culpability of the female.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.662" offset="405014">At issue in this case is the right of California to prosecute my client, Michael, for violation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.362" offset="439809">The statute provides, and I quote, it prohibits</text>
            <text syncTime="74.300" offset="447541">"an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a female not the wife of the perpetrator, where the female is under the age of 18 years. "</text>
            <text syncTime="86.467" offset="496233">The operative facts in this case are simply that Michael stands accused of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.666" offset="536984">He has not been convicted of the crime and comes before this Court clothed with the presumption of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.711" offset="549210">He is currently awaiting trial, pending the decision of the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.082" offset="570630">Both California and the United States, as amicus on behalf of California, have suggested to this Court that Michael is guilty of a crime of which he is not charged; that crime is forcible rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.671" offset="629040">The suggestion that force existed in this case is unsupported by any judicial finding and is immaterial to the issues presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.245" offset="667283">And, in my opinion, tends to obfuscate the issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="142.726" offset="721200">The information which is contained in the appendix is the charging document and it clearly states that Michael is charged with violation of the statute and the elements are simply that he participated in an act of sexual intercourse with a female who was under the age of 18.</text>

            <text syncTime="1865.593" offset="7612720">I am Deputy Attorney General Sandy R. Kriegler, appearing today on behalf of the people of the State of California, real party in interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.105" offset="7642708">I would like to discuss the constitutionality of California Penal Code Section 261.5, in light of the tests set forth by this Court for gender based classifications, in Craig v. Boren.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.990" offset="7690251">Under Craig v. Boren, classifications based upon gender are constitutional if they serve important governmental objectives, and if the classification scheme is substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.001" offset="7742287">This Court has recognized that classifications based upon gender are not invalid, per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.358" offset="7767783">Indeed, where the sexes are not similarly situated or in those situations where society imposes special burdens upon females, different treatment is allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.213" offset="7815221">We believe that the classification under the statute before the Court today is based upon physiological differences which do not reflect the type of invidious discrimination which the Equal Protection Clause prohibits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1963.099" offset="8002676">--Well Your Honor, the prosecutor obviously disagreed based upon the fact that the victim clearly testified, under oath at the preliminary hearing, that she submitted to the act of intercourse only after being slugged in the face 2 to 3 times with sufficient force to leave bruises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.576" offset="8084596">We believe that this case, while it is not perhaps sufficient to constitute a forcible rape, or at least the prosecutor who filed the charges did not feel so, it certainly approached that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.947" offset="8114062">And it was above the level of consensual intercourse, that one might normally expect to be involved in a situation involving two minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.990" offset="8150320">Certainly, the use of force, I feel, was the crucial factor in the prosecutor's decision to file this case as a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.800" offset="8177487">I would point out, however, to the Court that the case was originally filed in Juvenile Court, and the Petitioner was found unfit for treatment under the Juvenile Court law and then it came to adult court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.093" offset="8226702">So the initial filing was not even as a felony, it was under our Juvenile Court law under which there are no felonies or misdemeanors; it is not a criminal branch of our judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.447" offset="8272155">We believe that the important governmental interests served by Penal Code Section 261.5 are the deterrence of teenage pregnancy, the prevention of physical injury to minor females from sexual intercourse.</text>

            <text syncTime="3317.605" offset="13420785">We would strongly urge this Court to recognize the severe consequences that befall only the teenage female participant in an act of intercourse, regardless of the age of the male participant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.038" offset="13466447">And with the Court being aware, as it is, of the consequences of teenage pregnancy, I don't need to remind the Court certainly of the statements made in earlier cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.080" offset="13506676">I know, Mr. Justice Powell speaking for the Court in Bellotti v. Baird certainly recognized that the consequences of pregnancy, severe as they are to an adult woman, are even more severe to the unwed, teenage mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.903" offset="13557980">California legislature has recognized the disastrous consequences of teenage pregnancy and sexual abuse of minor females in the state of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.196" offset="13599149">The problem is conceded by Petitioner to be one of monumental proportions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.960" offset="13618166">The state of California has made the valid judgment that in view of the risks which are borne only by the minor female, none of which are suffered by the minor male, that criminal sanctions should be employed as it is, under California Penal Code Section 261.5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.389" offset="13687861">We ask this Court to leave intact California Penal Code Section 261.5 because of the degree of protection it provides to this particular class of individual is so needing in that protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.353" offset="13739688">We submit that the judgment of the California Supreme Court should be affirmed.</text>
