            <text syncTime="48.747" offset="350560">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="52.033" offset="363621">My name is Kent Harbison and I represent the petitioners in this case, those Minnesota officials charged with the responsibility of managing the annual Minnesota State Fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.406" offset="405104">The question before this Court is whether that State Fair, consistent with the First Amendment, may enforce a rule that essentially provides that all those persons or organizations who participate in the annual affair who desire to sell products, solicit monetary donations, or distribute literature or any other materials, whether it be flags, flowers, or whatever, may do so, but only from rented booths or similar fixed locations on the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.860" offset="526939">This case began in August of 1977 when the respondents, the Krishna Society, commenced a lawsuit in the state district court and obtained a temporary restraining order from that court enjoining the fair from enforcing that rule as it applies to them during that year's fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.637" offset="594126">The restraining order, however, also enjoined the Krishnas themselves from selling any of these items that I've mentioned on a peripatetic basis throughout the fairgrounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.577" offset="633832">In other words, the effect of that restraining order was to say, the state fair cannot require these respondents to engage in these activities only at a booth, but they must be permitted to do it throughout the fairgrounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="500.255" offset="2156562">The booth rule that were talking about is an inherent inseparable part of the state fair, and that's in part because the state fair has a system called the space rental system.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.367" offset="2221032">And under that the state fair enters into lease agreements with all these organizations and people who desire to sell and solicit and distribute materials.</text>

            <text syncTime="604.405" offset="2573162">In fact, there are approximately 1,400 booth operations on the fairgrounds during the period covered by this case, and these organizations that you're referring to, Your Honor, represent at least 40 of the organizations who at the time were considered to qualify probably as religious or political or news media type organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.735" offset="2658426">I think under the respondents' current proposal in their brief, that this be expanded to include charitable and noncommercial organizations as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.941" offset="2691340">I think it's likely that a significant number, in addition to these, of the 1,400 booth operators would qualify under that definition, whatever the definition may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.764" offset="2734599">But the rule, again, doesn't have any effect whatsoever on the ability or the right of anyone to engage in some communications or proselytizing, however you want to phrase it.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.089" offset="2791860">It relates primarily to the distribution and the monetary activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.193" offset="2808264">The respondents in this case are a religious organization whose members engage in an activity known as Sankirtan.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.347" offset="2836895">That consists of a number of aspects, singing, dancing, chanting, selling not only books but other tokens, and soliciting donations.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.922" offset="2879213">The first aspects of that, the first three, the singing, dancing, and chanting, the respondents don't claim or aren't pressing this Court or any other court that we're aware of as covered by their First Amendment arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.029" offset="2931667">In other words, they're not... perhaps they would be covered by it, I suppose, but they're not pressing those claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="718.095" offset="3027902">And not only so much because of the booth rule but because of the state fair management's inherent responsibility, as this Court recognized in Cox v. New Hampshire, which involved public streets, the responsibility to maintain some order so that they're not overlapping parades, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.306" offset="3100731">And I suggest that in this case there is even more evidence than there was in Cox v. New Hampshire that that sort of conflict would be posed.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.245" offset="3136467">The state fair would have a right and an obligation, in fact, to the public to control that sort of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.537" offset="3173665">It doesn't mean that it couldn't occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.453" offset="3181293">It just means it would have to be done in an orderly fashion so that there would be some order in an already crowded area, 40 to 45 acres, which on a typical day would have between 100,000 and 200,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.730" offset="3234478">I'd like to mention one more factual point here, I think that is of interest to this case, and that is, after the 1977 restraining order, there were about 17 or 18 members of ISKCON or Krishnas who did participate in the fair and engage in these activities outside the confines of a booth.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.424" offset="3309189">That was consistent with the restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.876" offset="3319011">What was not consistent, however, was the fact that they did sell, they did engage in sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.880" offset="3343043">The restraining order basically said that if you wish to sell something you still have to do that from a booth, but the other aspects of the booth rule we enjoin... the court, meaning "we"... enjoin as to the Krishnas.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.374" offset="3397064">In addition, the record shows that even just during this five or six day period when these sales and solicitations were taking place, the Krishnas represented... I should say, misrepresented themselves to the potential donors and purchasers, indicating that they represented something called the Division of Natural Resources, and schools for needy and handicapped children, drug treatment programs, and indeed the state fair itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.274" offset="3512630">And there is also evidence that these sorts of things took place with respect to donors who were minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.547" offset="3541678">It's been suggested by the respondents that this booth rule is a totally preclusive regulation, and it strikes me that if that were the case it would be virtually impossible ever to have any sort of regulations that weren't preclusive in some way, and it would be impossible to apply the balancing test, the reasonable time, place, and manner test, because there was always going to be some preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.412" offset="3633211">In fact, I refer the Court to the alternative suggested by the Minnesota Supreme Court and by the respondents themselves as alleging, allegedly, less restrictive alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.470" offset="3681381">They themselves involve some preclusive aspects and again, the booth rule, not only does and doesn't do what I've already discussed, but it doesn't give the state fair or any state official any discretion whatsoever to determine whether or not someone shall abide by the rule or whether they shall not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1638.935" offset="6711272">I'd like to emphasize one final point here and then reserve some time for rebuttal, and that is that it seems to me that the booth rule does not prohibit booth operators from talking to fairgoers as they walk around, or trying to sell them something or solicit donations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.380" offset="6777100">Roving solicitors simply have moving booths, that's all it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.751" offset="6794550">But the booth operator doesn't have the advantage to follow, pursue, harass, however you'd like to characterize it, fairgoers who aren't interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.355" offset="6824957">And I submit that's not enough of a justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.390" offset="6837078">The alternatives to the booth rule that are alleged to be less restrictive are both unworkable and I suspect constitutionally suspect because they would turn what is now a a non content directed rule into a regulation that inherently is going to require the state fair to look into the content and the religious basis of the organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.355" offset="6932999">They're suggesting that the state fair could do this by registering all organizations who are charitable or noncommercial, whomever they may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.428" offset="6965286">The problem with that is, how does the fair determine that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.463" offset="6977407">That sounds to me like the kind of regulation this Court struck down in Cantwell v. Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.184" offset="6996215">I don't think the state fair, even if they're qualified, would constitutionally be able to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.836" offset="7014919">The numerical limitations that have been suggested, the requirement to wear identification badges, sound nice in the abstract but in practice they wouldn't work; the state fair would have no way to guarantee that they were being complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.176" offset="7064238">What we have here is not an attempt to suppress communication but an attempt by the state fair along this less restrictive continuum to draw the line.</text>

            <text syncTime="1751.474" offset="7161414">The state in this case seeks to expel from the open and public areas of the state fair and to corral in these fixed booths, which indeed, as Mr. Harbison points out, are sometimes inside building, exercises of speech, press, and religion, which clearly lie at the very core of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.473" offset="7257440">Now, I think a number of the questions that have been directed to Mr. Harbison expose in a way that perhaps the record and the briefs alone would not have done quite so dramatically the sweep and breadth of this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.481" offset="7305505">Mr. Justice White asked, what about a politician walking around with information on a sign?</text>

            <text syncTime="1798.288" offset="7348660">But it appears, in the stipulated facts, as one might expect, since a rule against exhibiting or distributing literature can hardly draw much of a line between what you wear on your back and what you put in your palm and what you hand to someone, it appears that that might not be allowed at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3569.984" offset="14435471">I'd like to take up, may it please the Court, on that very point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.455" offset="14457309">Under Minnesota statutes, every law in Minnesota is severable unless it's expressly provided not to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.559" offset="14485731">Furthermore, the comment that the Minnesota Supreme Court suggested some lesser restrictive alternatives to the rule has to be taken with the understanding that their decision was based upon the assumption that they were dealing only with one organization, not with potentially 30, 40, 50, 100, whatever it might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.821" offset="14562844">I suggest that in light of the fact that they found substantial public purposes furthered by the rule, they would have concluded very likely that in a different way, because their allegedly less restrictive alternatives would not fit in the same context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.948" offset="14631285">So the basis for those alternatives is no longer there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.017" offset="14643615">Without the booth rule I'm suggesting that the entire nature of the state fair would be changed drastically and that's one of the factors this Court has typically looked at, the nature of the forum here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.544" offset="14701711">And I'd like to emphasize that the event of the annual state fair is not on the same plane, it's not the same as a public park or a public street corner.</text>

            <text syncTime="3654.255" offset="14772555">In the stipulation, the rule is quoted and it refers to</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.857" offset="14786975">"sale or distribution of any merchandise, including printed or written material, except under license issued for from the society and/or from a duly licensed location. "</text>
