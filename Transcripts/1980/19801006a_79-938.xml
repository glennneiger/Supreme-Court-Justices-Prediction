            <text syncTime="358.914" offset="1584525">Briefly, the facts of this case are that on July 1, 1974, Mr. Hague resided with his family in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.488" offset="1630814">He had traveled for 15 years to work in Minnesota but he resided in Wisconsin with his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.411" offset="1658504">On that date he was riding as a passenger on his son's motorcycle when it was struck in the rear by another Wisconsin resident.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.433" offset="1694658">Mr. Hague, the son, and the person hitting him were Wisconsin residents; the accident took place on a Wisconsin road.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.623" offset="1731333">Neither his son, whose cycle he was on, nor the person who hit him, had insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.277" offset="1754008">Therefore, any insurance available in wrongful death action came from Mr. Hague's, or would come from Mr. Hague's uninsured motorist coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.632" offset="1791415">In Wisconsin you can stack that; in Minnesota you cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.786" offset="1816075">Two years later Mrs. Hague... two years later, I mean in 1976, approximately two years after this accident, Mrs. Hague moved to Minnesota and began this action; contemporaneously with moving here she was appointed the representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.914" offset="1888591">Her capacity as plaintiff is as a representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.699" offset="1899667">The contacts in that setting are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.901" offset="1912519">The contacts in Minnesota, that the Minnesota court felt significant, were, number one, that Mr. Hague had traveled to Minnesota for some 15 years prior to this accident; that Allstate did business in the State of Minnesota; that Mrs. Hague at the time she began this action was a resident of the State of Minnesota; and that now Minnesota had some interest in the heirs of this estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.921" offset="2032578">The contacts with the State of Wisconsin are that with regard to the occurrence, it involved three Wisconsin residents, it took place on Wisconsin roads which presumably are regulated by the State of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.280" offset="2094018">The action before you is a contract declaratory judgment action.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.934" offset="2116587">This contract was applied for, written, and delivered in the State of Wisconsin; most importantly, written to conform with Wisconsin's law which had $15,000 worth of minimum coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.527" offset="2178968">That is why this particular type of coverage was written and all the premiums on this insurance policy were at all times paid from the State of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.950" offset="2216689">Looking at those contacts qualitatively, the Minnesota contacts, the fact that Minnesota does, or Allstate does business in the State of Minnesota is important to jurisdiction but it does not give Minnesota an interest as to what Allstate does with contracts in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.767" offset="2315954">It's... if that were true, you'd be in somewhat the same situation as in Savchuk v. Rush, where they tried to tie some significance to State Farm being in all 50 states and Justice White dismissed that as not being a significant test for jurisdiction purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.161" offset="2389515">The other tests that Mr.... or one other test, that Mr. Hague drove to Minnesota, has really nothing to do with either this transaction, in that the transaction was written to comply with the Wisconsin statutes as a Wisconsin risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.456" offset="2462762">It has nothing to do with this occurrence because there's no... there is agreement on all sides that Mr. Hague was not going to work, coming from work, having anything to do with work at the time he was injured.</text>

            <text syncTime="630.574" offset="2671219">I think that along those lines I think that choice of law cases have not had as much exposure as jurisdiction cases, but I think we would argue that they're perhaps more important in that jurisdiction establishes a convenience test, where you can hale a person into court, where choice of law really decides what is going to be the ultimate outcome, the disposition of matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.058" offset="2781142">It's a little bit like saying that jurisdiction may decide where a person is going to be hung, but choice of law would decide whether he is going to be hung.</text>

            <text syncTime="743.395" offset="3122511">In both of those, this Court reversed a forum court that applied its own law because it said that contacts were either too slight or casual; or that, in Yates, by applying the Georgia jury, letting the matter go to the jury, did not give full faith and credit to New York's law.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.744" offset="3207879">Those... more importantly, I should probably distinguish those cases which, in which you have let the forum court apply its own law over the contracting, the state of contracting.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.468" offset="3258765">The two that are the most prominent are Watson and Clay.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.289" offset="3282067">Now, those are distinguished from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.573" offset="3295232">First of all, Watson.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.525" offset="3307040">In Watson you allowed direct action in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.743" offset="3327833">The injury took place in Louisiana to a resident of Louisiana and the Louisiana court applied its direct action statute without regard to the policy of insurance which was made and delivered in another state, which indicated you could not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.390" offset="3402439">This Court said that was all right for Louisiana to do that and in so doing recognized that Louisiana had a significant contact in interest with this, with the matter under consideration because the person at the time they were injured was a resident of Louisiana and the injury took place in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.970" offset="3488747">Neither of those things happened in Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.839" offset="3500241">With regard to Clay, Clay was... is perhaps somewhat analogous in that we're talking about an ambulatory contract It was a contract on personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.246" offset="3553844">I think it was drawn in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.931" offset="3560636">Mr. Clay, after it was made and drawn in Illinois, moved to Florida, lived there for two years, paid insurance premiums from there, and then after that time the loss occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.791" offset="3624062">Florida applied its law to nullify a contract provision in that Illinois contract which would have limited actions to a certain period of time which had now expired, in order to give its resident the right to recover on this insurance policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.737" offset="3691876">That case came up to this Court twice, but finally this Court indicated that because Mr. Clay had moved to Wisconsin, in that the loss took place in... or not Wisconsin, Florida; and the loss took place in Florida; and presumably that the company accepted premiums from Florida for that two years; that not only did Florida have an interest in this matter, but it didn't upset anybody's justified expectations because the premiums came and everybody knew the risk had moved to Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.362" offset="3838370">That did not happen in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.128" offset="3849446">In this case all of the contacts which this Court has previously indicated would lean toward the choice of that state's laws are in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.121" offset="3897407">With regard to Professor Leflar's discussion, I think perhaps we should touch upon it because it seems this has become a favorite of law review articles and this Minnesota Supreme Court certainly gave that more weight and credence than they did the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.022" offset="4009002">Professor Leflar indicates a five-stage test to deciding choice of law: predictability of results, maintenance of governmental order, simplification of judicial task, governmental interest, and better rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.066" offset="4077129">Now, Minnesota somehow applied that test and got to their law.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.535" offset="4094997">I think that if you really look at what Professor Leflar has indicated, number one, Minnesota did that without looking to the constitutional safeguards, and that's why we're here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.076" offset="4137211">But even if you were just to look at Professor Leflar's test as it applies to the fact that now we have to look at the interests of the states and we have a more fluid society, that sort of approach, it still leans to Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.002" offset="4192904">In other words, predictability of results, his first test, very important in a contract dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1615.024" offset="6609022">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.928" offset="6628561">I'd like, if I may, to open by answering the question put by Justice Blackmun about probate and the relations of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.068" offset="6673178">There was probate in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.535" offset="6679030">It happened the decedent did own a vacant parcel of land there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.639" offset="6695435">There was a joint tenancy homestead which passed outside of probate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.024" offset="6712989">In Minnesota, there were a variety of interests at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.309" offset="6730125">The decedent worked in Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.495" offset="6738902">He had a profit-sharing retirement plan, he had some trust benefits, some medical benefits, he had some accrued compensation payroll where he had worked that wasn't due yet, and he had life insurance proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.338" offset="6790207">As you undoubtedly know better than I do, Justice Blackmun, the place where the accident happened near where they lived, Hager City, is a very small place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.026" offset="6828973">Red Wing, which is where he worked, is the larger place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.280" offset="6849975">It's where... one would go shopping, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.030" offset="6856976">In fact, when he was lying on the ground, the ambulance came and brought him to Red Wing to the hospital there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.803" offset="6892084">If, for example, he had not been dead on arrival and there had been, let's say, two or three weeks of medical care, intensive care, that kind of thing, obviously one would have thought that Minnesota has an interest in recovering that kind of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.348" offset="6962302">That's one of the dangers, I think, in the notion that at the moment of impact of the car and the motorcycle you freeze all events.</text>

            <text syncTime="2183.439" offset="8882615">If I could make a somewhat roundabout answer to your question, Justice Stevens, I think it's worth putting this whole question of uninsured motorist insurance in context a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.378" offset="8926396">Just let me back up for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.794" offset="8932039">It starts out in about the mid-60s.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.330" offset="8946249">In many states there is a drive for compulsory insurance and the insurance industry resists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.686" offset="8975611">In other states there's a drive for no-fault insurance, and the insurance industry resists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.988" offset="8992852">And what they say, they recognized the problem of the uncompensated traffic victim and they say, here's what we'll do: we'll offer a policy, and then later some states required it, but we'll offer a policy that says the motor vehicle owner and members of his household, as defined in one of those small print clauses, but basically that's right... will be covered for accidents arising where the fault is that of the uninsured motorist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.561" offset="9131092">In other words, it's a kind of hybrid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.927" offset="9136630">It's first-party coverage but it's tort; it's negligence, it's not a non-fault coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.298" offset="9154080">Well, now, what happens is, it works both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.167" offset="9169544">You are covered, yourself, and your members of your family, wherever you may be, in... it doesn't have to be your own car, and also occupants of your car are covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.907" offset="9216564">So it happens all the time that, let's say, Mr. A has insurance, including this insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.496" offset="9246867">He then is driving as a passenger in Mr. B's car when X, the uninsured motorist, negligently runs into them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.269" offset="9281975">So A is covered under his own policy, for which he's paid a premium, and he's covered as an occupant under B's policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.023" offset="9313009">Now, then the question is, what does the coverage say?</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.927" offset="9332548">The insurance companies try to make so-called other insurance clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.897" offset="9356476">And there is a standard clause put out by the National Insurance Bureau, which was followed in this policy and seems to be in all the textbooks and in nearly all the policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.753" offset="9391898">It didn't quite say there shall never be stacking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.138" offset="9401407">Apparently, if they'd said that, the insurance commissioners' wouldn't have permitted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.740" offset="9415827">But what they tried to do is to say, if there are two policies, one of them is excess to the other and you don't get more than the total limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.811" offset="9444143">Now, then, the stacking cases came up and I was astounded... if you look at Professor Widiss's book on uninsured motorist insurance, which came out in 1969... there's a 1980 supplement... it's about 400 pages of mostly cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.557" offset="9519167">All this has come up in the last few years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.574" offset="9527213">Interestingly enough, about a third of the cases seem to involve Allstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.461" offset="9542782">So they're very fully aware of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.961" offset="9548738">There's no unexpected there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.496" offset="9558873">And the majority of states so far... it's a little hard to have an exact rule, because not all of the cases involve the highest court of the state... and there are different kinds of stacking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.869" offset="9596385">There's the guy in the other fellow's car, and there's also the fellow who has more than one policy, or more than one car on the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.208" offset="9625747">The majority of states that have faced this problem have said, we will permit recovery on each policy since, after all, a premium has been paid on each policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.032" offset="9681022">And there's no windfall, since there is actual... it only goes up to the provable damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.871" offset="9708398">It's not like having two policies on a boat that sinks and you could recover $4,000 on a $2,000 boat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.775" offset="9735983">That's not this at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.759" offset="9739954">This is recovery for accidental injury or death up to your provable damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.863" offset="9760329">In our case we had a 52-year-old man who was earning about $15,000 and had children, so there's no issue here, that he's being somehow given a windfall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.837" offset="9804215">Now, if I may get back... a somewhat longwinded answer to your question... if they had absolutely said, no stacking, I think the Wisconsin insurance commissioner would probably have said, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.413" offset="9866491">Probably the Minnesota insurance commissioner would have said no.</text>

            <text syncTime="2451.612" offset="9955307">And so the policy here... which is why I think, in fact... to come back to Justice Blackmun... the rate's probably higher in Wisconsin rather than lower.</text>

            <text syncTime="2531.564" offset="10275151">Perhaps the most important one for our present purposes is, that under the present rulings of this Court there would have been no jurisdiction in Home Insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.586" offset="10311200">Home Insurance against Dick is really the grandfather of Seider and Roth, and Rush and Savchuk, and all of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.240" offset="10337844">It was a quasi-in-rem action brought by taxing the alleged res, which was the obligation to reinsure, of a New York company that was doing business in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.565" offset="10387164">That is to say, Anglo-Mejicana, which was the actual insurer had no connection whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.619" offset="10407330">That's one point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.285" offset="10410047">Second, there was a choice of law clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.404" offset="10422481">It said, this policy will be governed by the Commercial Code of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.873" offset="10436378">And third, as I already said, it specifically said, the following rivers are the only ones covered by this policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2621.456" offset="10634700">Because, one, it's understood that this is nationwide, in fact, continental-wide, all of North America, policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.696" offset="10683706">Second, that the insurance company itself does business... in fact, I think it's the fourth largest insurer with over 200,000 policies... in Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.773" offset="10735951">If you recall, for example, the quite interesting opinion in the Watson case by Justice Frankfurter, in which he has a kind of alternative argument to the one used by Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.783" offset="10792062">He says the insurance company knew all about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.383" offset="10802406">It came into Louisiana, it took advantage of the privilege of doing business there, and it's bound by the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.238" offset="10837828">I think that same argument applies to Allstate in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.308" offset="10858099">So that if... in other words, if the Minnesota Supreme Court had then said in the present case, Hague against Allstate is different from Van Tassel against Horace Mann, which is the principal case in which they in Minnesota said, we apply stacking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.456" offset="10938661">It's different because there is a choice of law clause, because the anti-stacking clauses are unambiguous in contrast to the other case... here they're the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.077" offset="10977218">If it had made all those points, I think that is an appropriate way for the Minnesota Supreme Court to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.083" offset="11013267">If it had still said, no, because what we're concerned with is protection, is the role of the accident compensation system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.075" offset="11057152">And we have our widow, we have an estate that we are concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.395" offset="11086514">And if it had said that, that doesn't strike me as arbitrary action of the kind that this Court ought to interfere with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.437" offset="11126638">This Court is not, I think, a court of errors and appeals on the choice of law theories.</text>

            <text syncTime="3148.331" offset="12742259">I think what you told them in those cases is, don't decide this case; it ought to be adjudicated somewhere else, or dismissed... as in Volkswagen... dismiss the following parties from the case, and then you can go ahead with other parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="3259.635" offset="13187386">It's no accident, Mr. Chief Justice, that the conflict of laws has really been in the forefront of experimentation in the whole area of accident compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.360" offset="13230331">That is, we've had, for example, the series of guest statute cases that I'm sure you're familiar with, many in New York, some in California and elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.514" offset="13258961">And the result over time, though the conflict theories have tended to vary with the different professors and the different judges, in the end we've had a reduction in guest statutes; we've had a reduction in wrongful death limitations; a variety of these kind of quirky state rules have tended to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.962" offset="13348718">In other words, conflict of laws has been an engine of law reform generally and I think it would be very unfortunate if this Court were to stop that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.651" offset="13387484">I think that's what Professor Freund meant in his essay about Chief Justice Stone, which is cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.639" offset="13415487">It's what Chief Judge Kaufman meant in the Pearson case in which he warned against returning to the "ice age" of conflict of laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.245" offset="13449864">I think altogether a dynamic federalism, Mr. Chief Justice, would be furthered by a statement that the Court will come in only at a certain time, only when there's really arbitrary action, not by an attempt to draw particular rules of this kind here.</text>
