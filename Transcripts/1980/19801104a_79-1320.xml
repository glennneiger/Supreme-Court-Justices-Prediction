            <text syncTime="127.246" offset="656680">The premise is that safety concerns increase, safety concerns with motor vehicles increase as their length increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.803" offset="702864">And the central issue here is the proper scope of review by a federal district court of such a factual determination by a legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.627" offset="746123">Iowa submits the District Court misperceived its fact-finding function and inappropriately substituted its judgment for that of the Iowa Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.732" offset="794606">Rather than making a de novo determination whether Iowa's 60-foot limitation promotes safety, the federal court should ask only whether, on this record, a reasonable legislature could believe that length limitations promote highway safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.690" offset="882378">Put a little differently, Iowa contends the Court should not have asked, as it plainly did, does this evidence persuade me as a matter of adjudicative fact that a 65-foot twin trailer is significantly less safe than a 60-foot twin trailer, or a 55-foot semi?</text>
            <text syncTime="203.823" offset="962939">Rather, the Court should have asked, could a reasonable legislature conclude that the length of vehicles operating on highways should be limited in the interest of safety?</text>
            <text syncTime="216.929" offset="1015393">If so could a legislature then conclude that it's reasonable to draw a line at 60 feet?</text>
            <text syncTime="223.786" offset="1042770">The question then is, what is the question?</text>
            <text syncTime="227.720" offset="1058548">And we think both parties agree that if Iowa's limitation is properly viewed as a safety measure, Iowa should prevail.</text>

            <text syncTime="3488.021" offset="14099710">So we're not dealing with the case where the regulation promotes safety at least directly, in other words, by prohibiting a hazardous vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.564" offset="14129908">The vehicle is not hazardous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.642" offset="14138267">Mr. Justice Marshall earlier referred to increased splash and spray.</text>

            <text syncTime="3517.415" offset="14217366">There's quite conclusive proof of that, so we're not dealing with a case of a regulation which promotes safety directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.380" offset="14245160">There's a second level though here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.959" offset="14255504">If that vehicle is safe, what we're dealing with in terms of burden is an economic burden, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.987" offset="14279641">But also a safety burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.299" offset="14288837">Iowa's legislation makes it more hazardous to conduct interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.218" offset="14308481">Regardless of what Consolidated does, whether it runs its goods at 55-foot semis, 60-foot twins, or runs them around the State in 65-foot twins, or shuttles them through the State in broken-down twins, that commerce is more hazardous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.994" offset="14363651">So you have a case where on the one hand you're promoting state's safety interest solely by reducing traffic, because the vehicle itself is safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.944" offset="14403462">And on the other hand you're increasing the hazard of interstate commerce.</text>
