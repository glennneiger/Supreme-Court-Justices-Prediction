            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="16.056" offset="156220">This case comes to us on certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.179" offset="184745">The Kenai National Moose Range is a national wildlife refuge created from public lands in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.744" offset="222989">The Secretary of the Interior for many years had granted oil and gas leases within the Range.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.831" offset="255381">The question in this case concerns entitlement to royalties received under these leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.444" offset="285787">The question arises because of facial conflict between two statutes enacted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.270" offset="317134">Under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 and a formula consistently applied until -- from the 1950s until 1975, Alaska received 90% of the revenue and the United States government 10%.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.303" offset="397173">The Secretary of the Interior now relies on a 1964 amendment to a later statute, the Wildlife Refuge Sharing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.545" offset="446179">On its face this statute allocates 25% of the revenue to counties in which the refuge is located and 75% to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.460" offset="505843">In the absence of any evidence of congressional intent to repeal the earlier statute by implication, we conclude as a matter of statutory construction that the original allocation of revenue remains in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.819" offset="575328">This is entirely consistent with administrative interpretation that continued until 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.108" offset="608452">We therefore affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.254" offset="625065">Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.732" offset="638963">Mr. Justice Stewart has filed a dissenting opinion joined by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Marshall.</text>
