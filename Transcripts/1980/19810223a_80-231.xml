            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="150920">We will proceed to hear arguments in the related case of the Secretary v. Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.058" offset="199090">Mr. Buscemi, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="62.740" stopTime="138.388">
            <label>Mr. Peter Buscemi</label>
            <text syncTime="62.740" offset="401800">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="67.894" offset="422489">This case is much the same as the Virginia case, and with respect to at least the Tenth Amendment and the Commerce Clause, I'm pretty much content to rely on what has already been said and what's said in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.452" offset="472644">This case is here on direct appeal from the District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.004" offset="490930">The statutory provisions challenged here are different and far more numerous than those invalidated by the Virginia District Court, and I'd like to begin by describing briefly the portions of the Act that are at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.579" offset="541189">The first group of statutory provisions are the so-called prime farmland provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.198" offset="563655">Those are six subsections of the Act that impose special requirements where a mine operator proposes to undertake surface mining operations on lands that satisfy the Secretary of Agriculture's definition of prime farmland... and this is something that tends to be ignored in the District Court's consideration of the case and in appellees' brief... that historically have been used for intensive agricultural purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.682" offset="665637">So this is just not some land that someone classifies as prime farmland on the basis of a soil sample.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.936" offset="690610">This is land that has been used intensively for agricultural purposes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="138.388" stopTime="149.946">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="138.388" offset="704402">And it's your position that Congress under the Commerce Clause can freeze that classification?</text>
            <text syncTime="145.394" offset="732406">If it was once used as prime farmland, it's going to be prime farmland?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="149.946" stopTime="189.923">
            <label>Mr. Peter Buscemi</label>
            <text syncTime="149.946" offset="750691">That's not what the statute does, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.814" offset="762081">The statute only says that if surface mining is undertaken on prime farmland, then before the permit is issued the operator has to to demonstrate that his technological capability to restore that land to equivalent or higher levels of yield as non-mined prime farmland in the surrounding area under equivalent levels of management.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.281" offset="859988">So the statute simply says that if you've got prime farmland and it's been used as prime farmland, and you propose to surface mine it, when you finish you've got to put it back into the same productive condition that it was in before.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="189.923" stopTime="192.375">
            <label>Justice White</label>
            <text syncTime="189.923" offset="910561">And to keep it that way for five years?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="192.375" stopTime="373.442">
            <label>Mr. Peter Buscemi</label>
            <text syncTime="192.375" offset="920383">There is the provision that there has to be revegetation and that revegetation has to exist for a period of five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.795" offset="950058">There is some question about how the Act is interpreted and applied in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.135" offset="983390">The Secretary issued a regulation requiring the growing of row crops.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.352" offset="1000318">That regulation was invalidated by the District Court in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.740" offset="1017872">The Secretary has appealed that to the D.C. Circuit, but of course there is no way of knowing right now what the D.C. Circuit will do or whether the new Administration will continue all of these policies, including this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.464" offset="1072729">So that, at least, as for right now, the row crop regulation is not in effect and all we're talking about is revegetation.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.718" offset="1097702">Now, the operator will also have to show that he can meet the soil reconstruction standards for prime farmland.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.675" offset="1137617">They require that the different topsoil layers be removed separately and restored separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.711" offset="1157679">There are also a number of other generally applicable provisions, that is, not applicable only to prime farmland, that were challenged in the Indiana case and not in the Virginia case.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.554" offset="1213059">They include the general requirement that topsoil be removed separately and the general requirement for the submission of reclamation plans before the beginning of surface mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.029" offset="1259034">These plans are supposed to tell the regulatory authority, whether it's a state authority or the federal authority, what the premining use of the land is, what the postmining proposed use is, and describe the methods by which the postmining use will be achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.038" offset="1319011">And finally there's a challenge in the Indiana case to Sections 522(a), (c), and (d) of the Act, also not challenged in the Virginia case, that involve the establishment of procedures for designating land as unsuitable for surface mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.850" offset="1394244">Section 522(e), which is the statute that prohibits mining within specified areas of roads, schools, parks, and churches, and so on, was also challenged in the Indiana case as was the civil penalty provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.561" offset="1465088">Now, perhaps I can talk first, since I didn't reach it in the other case, about the Just Compensation Clause point.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.471" offset="1516706">In this case, as in the Virginia case, our first position is that the Just Compensation argument is premature here because we're not focussing on any particular piece of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.112" offset="1571354">That makes the case different from the vast majority if not all of the cases in which this Court has considered taking challenges to state or federal regulatory actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.669" offset="1617539">Neither the plaintiffs in the Indiana case nor those in the Virginia case have focussed on any particular piece of property--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="373.442" stopTime="378.244">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="373.442" offset="1644602">You mean that issue could be raised at a later point by another litigant.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="378.244" stopTime="397.741">
            <label>Mr. Peter Buscemi</label>
            <text syncTime="378.244" offset="1663828">--Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.679" offset="1669575">As this Court said in Agins v. Tiburon, just last term, the only issue here is whether the mere enactment of the statute constitutes a taking, because we don't know how the statute is going to apply to a particular piece of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.320" offset="1720148">We can evaluate the other beneficial uses that might be available to the property owner.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="397.741" stopTime="412.483">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="397.741" offset="1741882">But that is interpreting a California statute where the California courts had held there was no such thing as inverse condemnation.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.513" offset="1776886">And as I understand, the Tucker Act provides that there is inverse condemnation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="412.483" stopTime="471.189">
            <label>Mr. Peter Buscemi</label>
            <text syncTime="412.483" offset="1800814">Well, the Tucker Act certainly does provide a monetary remedy for alleged violations of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.839" offset="1838221">Now whether the Tucker Act would give a remedy to an individual landowner on the basis of a regulatory piece of legislation like this is something that has not really been addressed by the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.183" offset="1895586">There is one indication in the Eastport Shipping case that was cited in the brief that perhaps the Court of Claims would think that the Tucker Act jurisdiction does not go that far, but I completely agree, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that the availability of the Tucker Act is a factor that should be considered by the Court before addressing this Just Compensation Clause question because if the alleged taking of a particular piece of property can be redressed through the providing of compensation, then there's no constitutional violation, because the Just Compensation Clause requires only compensation, it doesn't prohibit--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="471.189" stopTime="501.839">
            <label>Justice Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="471.189" offset="2035602">Well, let me see if I understand that, Mr. Buscemi.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.256" offset="2043857">What you're suggesting is that if the Tucker Act in just compensation cases reaches only eminent domain cases, that is where the Government initiates the condemnation, if that's all, then we do have a constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.266" offset="2103939">Whereas if the Tucker Act reaches also so-called inverse condemnation, whether regulation or whatever it may be, in and of itself, constitutes a taking and provides compensation, then we don't reach the constitutional question?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_buscemi" startTime="501.839" stopTime="505.727">
            <label>Mr. Peter Buscemi</label>
            <text syncTime="501.839" offset="2158273">--That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.039" offset="2159005">And I think that it's important... I mean, I think that that just--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="505.727" stopTime="507.593">
            <label>Justice Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="505.727" offset="2173738">Is that true also in the other case?</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter Buscemi</label>
            <text syncTime="507.593" offset="2181261">--Yes, it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.679" offset="2185545">I mean, I think that just supports the general notion that these taking questions ought to be addressed in the context of the application of the statute to particular pieces of property rather than in the context of the statute as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.487" offset="2232775">Because we just don't know how the statute is going to be applied in a particular circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.939" offset="2250642">Now, I do want to say in connection with the taking argument in the Indiana case just a little bit about this high levels of management business that is emphasized by the district court, and also in the briefs of appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.474" offset="2368716">There's nothing in the statute that talks about high levels of management so far as restoration of prime farmland to productivity levels obtained at high levels of management.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.099" offset="2415214">That's something that the district courts have injected into the case by saying that we're going to define high levels of management as those producing yields that are impossible to reach after surface mining, and then concluding that the statute imposes an impossible burden.</text>

            <text syncTime="1111.046" offset="4595080">There was a particular piece of property involved in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.998" offset="4606887">That was a case that was brought by a particular property owner to prevent the homeowner from taking advantage of the Pennsylvania state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.139" offset="4659446">I don't know what the relief was that was granted in that case, whether it was an across-the-board injunction or whether it was an injunction strictly speaking that ran only to that one piece of land, but in any event the critical point is that the challenge was made in the context of a particular factual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.815" offset="4722140">And I think that Mr. Justice Holmes' opinion for the Court focused on the private relationship between the coal company and the landowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.004" offset="4754845">The Court was simply unwilling to allow the landowner to rely on this intervening Pennsylvania state law to get out from under the burden of his bargain that he had struck on an arm's length basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.645" offset="4797477">There was no suggestion in Mahon that the Court disagreed with the general principle stated by Mr. Justice Brandeis in his dissent, which I believe was joined by several other Members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.501" offset="4840840">And finally, with respect to Mahon, I'm not at all sure that the... at least, as to the Section 522(e) of the Act, which is also part of this taking problem, the valid existing rights provision in 522(e) might well have obviated the Mahon problem if it were to arise under the Act in connection with one of the prohibitions in 522(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.020" offset="4950972">Now, that's not true, of course, with respect to the prime farmlands, because that's not subject to valid existing rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.989" offset="4970825">But I just do want to make that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.508" offset="4980856">Finally, I do want to address just briefly the Due Process Clause challenges here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.196" offset="5011681">There are two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.229" offset="5015756">The first one deals with the summary cessation order procedure under 521(a)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.950" offset="5038639">Now, again, we begin with the same kind of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.402" offset="5052432">No one in Indiana and perhaps one of the plaintiffs in the Virginia case... but that was not in the record at trial... but as far as we know from the record, certainly, none of these people have ever been subjected to summary cessation orders, or to the imposition of civil penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.883" offset="5126411">And we think that under those circumstances the due process challenge is premature and that I mean in a real timing sense, rather that as far as focusing on a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.803" offset="5158071">We just haven't had these things apply to these plaintiffs yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.155" offset="5171446">In any event, we don't think that either the civil penalty provisions in Section 518 or the summary cessation orders deprive mine operators of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.581" offset="5221183">The only time that a cessation order will be issued in a summary fashion before there's notice given and an opportunity for abatement is when the inspector determines that there is a violation of the Act or a violation of the permit condition that creates an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public, or is causing or can reasonably be expected to cause significant imminent environmental harm to the land air or water resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.981" offset="5330793">Now, that standard, we suggest, is very similar to standards that this Court has already upheld for summary administrative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.921" offset="5366528">And also other federal courts, such as the Fourth Circuit, in Sink v. Morton, arose under the Mine Safety and Health Act, but involves very similar standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.812" offset="5410100">Now, of course, the district court makes much of the fact that some of these summary cessation orders may have been issued to mine operators other than the plaintiffs erroneously and in the first few months of the statute's effectiveness I gather that there were a small number of erroneous summary cessation orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.825" offset="5498185">In fact, the one that was issued to Paramount Mining Corporation, which is the plaintiff in the Virginia case, was issued erroneously and it was reversed approximately two months later when there was an administrative hearing held.</text>

            <text syncTime="1353.485" offset="5564850">It was simply a question of whether they could dump spoil in one area rather than another.</text>

            <text syncTime="1655.562" offset="6773065">Chief Justice Burger, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.114" offset="6791351">I believe the Government has articulated the main difference between the Indiana case and the Virginia case, and that is that we encompass some 21 different or additional subsections of the statute, and before getting into the Tenth Amendment issue or the federalism issue I would like to go into some further explanation of the various sections of the statute that are involved under the Tenth Amendment as well as the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.716" offset="6913709">We have divided those into four basic groups, and the first group would be the prime farmland provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.389" offset="6940458">And I don't think at this point that there is any doubt about the effect of the prime farmland provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.293" offset="6964073">The effects of the prime farmland provisions, quite simply, are that at the conclusion of taking the coal out of the ground you've got to put everything back in, in three separate layers, and that land has to be farmed, minimally, for five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.152" offset="7027498">And as the district court in the Star Coal Company case in Ohio found... or in Iowa found, it may even take 20 years of farming to get that land back to the point of equivalent levels of yield under high levels of management.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.264" offset="7095939">That term, high levels of management, as an aside here, is found in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.466" offset="7116732">"High levels of management" were used by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.018" offset="7130943">I don't think there's any doubt about where it comes from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.036" offset="7138989">But in any event, prime farmland provisions were intended by Congress to require a farming use and allowed no other uses, no other variances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.110" offset="7183292">It was expressed by at least three Senators on the floor of the Senate at the time it was introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.014" offset="7210878">As a matter of fact, it was expressed in the terms, we don't want any state bureaucrat to have the discretion to allow some other land use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.770" offset="7245986">And that's how it was expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.405" offset="7252464">And that's how it was put in the Act, and that is the way it's going to be enforced either by the Federal Government or by the states under the threat of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.661" offset="7293529">Now, the Government has said that this is the regulation of private activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.165" offset="7315576">But it seems to me that the thrust goes far beyond private activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.636" offset="7337415">It goes directly into land use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.587" offset="7353193">And I think that under the Tenth Amendment issue, at least, the initial question that must be decided is, what is land use planning and activity insofar as the state is concerned and in relationship to National League of Cities, that's been heretofore decided?</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.518" offset="7428948">And to me, I think National League of Cities was the beginning, at least, of defining what is an area of sovereignty in which the Federal Government cannot intrude that's going to be held to the states?</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.944" offset="7490597">And it also started to state what it's not going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.462" offset="7504703">And quite candidly with the Court, I don't think I can say that land use planning is wholly a governmental service, if you will, but I can certainly say it is not simply the regulation of private activities relating directly to Commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="1889.930" offset="7710548">I think the first thing that was important was that there was a direct command speaking to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.851" offset="7738238">I think the second thing that was important was what it spoke about, and maybe what it spoke about was more important than that it actually did speak to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.624" offset="7773346">And I think land use planning, if we are to make a comparison to the second tier, if you will, of National League of Cities, I think it's much more akin to that than anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.213" offset="7811694">I think land use planning and control involves matters that transcend mere economics and commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.401" offset="7844504">It goes to the very heart of what a community's going to be like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.103" offset="7855266">And I think this Court has said it on many different occasions, land use planning is an instrument to create a quality of life and a character within a community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.543" offset="7893091">Now, if this power... of the states, if you will; it's used to do that... it seems to me is equal to the services that were relied upon, at least in part, in National League of Cities to get the Court to where it got.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.069" offset="7955158">Now, to carry it one step further, I think within the Tenth Amendment there is room... and I think it is in the intent, if you will, of the framers... that the states not only were to be a government to give governmental services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.918" offset="8042512">The states... if a state is going to be a government, it has to have something more than the right to have employees to run police departments and schools and hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.107" offset="8087338">A state, I believe, must have some independent sphere of governance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.344" offset="8108236">I can't say that that is precisely what National League of Cities said, but I think, if our constitutional framework is to make any sense whatsoever, if the states are to govern, if they're to have some degree of independence, there must be then some independent sphere of government, or governance, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.543" offset="8201023">I think the only real question remaining after National League of Cities would be, how is that to be defined, where are we to go with that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.815" offset="8238117">And I think that once an area like land use planning comes before the Court and it has the attributes that land use planning does, and that is that it concerns matters that are so peculiar to each given community they can only be determined by looking at a wide diversity of climate, geography, geology, preferences, and character.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.418" offset="8360579">And when you are required to come to different policies based on these peculiar matters that are so central locally, I think that may well qualify as an independent sphere of governance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.944" offset="8410629">I think as Chief Justice Burger's question at the outset, as to what does the Tenth Amendment mean, I think it has to mean that there is some sphere of governance left to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.318" offset="8456187">And I think part of that has to be land use planning and control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.187" offset="8471651">And I think once that issue and question is resolved, I think the next problem is, where do we go from there?</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.626" offset="8509372">Because we admit, in the State of Indiana, and the coal companies admit, that there is in fact areas, possibly, where land use planning might become tangentially involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.284" offset="8560050">We cannot take the position that it is always separate and apart from the power of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.040" offset="8590979">And we would propose that if this is a central right, if you will, under the first ten Amendments, that the Court simply go into the weighing and balancing process that it has gone into in making these types of determinations in other Amendment cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2241.357" offset="9116249">I think it does this in other Commerce Clause situations where the Federal Government has not stepped in with regulations and a state has stepped in and is regulated, in order to determine whether or not that's an undue burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.133" offset="9171420">The Court looks to the policy that the state is pursuing when it does come into that area, and it balances whether or not the benefits of the state policy are out of proportion or in proportion to the burdens on interstate commerce that are created by it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2293.408" offset="9324497">I think... and I don't think there's any doubt about where they came from... I think the prime farmland provisions came from land use policies, a land use conflict, if you will, in the State of Illinois.</text>

            <text syncTime="2308.502" offset="9384892">And over there the State of Illinois has an abundance of underground mineable reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.571" offset="9409134">Eighty percent of their coal reserves are mineable by the underground method.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.957" offset="9426688">Indiana to date... less than one percent of our actual coal is mined by the underground method.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.213" offset="9455736">We cannot mine coal in Indiana by the underground method.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.248" offset="9471828">We do not have the conflict between surface mine and prime farmland that's present in the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.354" offset="9500249">And the State of Illinois dealt with this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.973" offset="9510802">Although Senator Stevenson said he didn't like the state bureaucrat having the discretion to do what they were going to do in Illinois... that is to say, whether to use this prime farmland or not, Indiana doesn't have that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.345" offset="9552285">But we have six counties in southern Indiana whose whole way of life is wrapped up with coal mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.434" offset="9584572">It has come to life in the last ten years because of coal mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.652" offset="9601500">We have one county down there, 50 percent of its tax revenues are directly related to surface coal mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.492" offset="9628876">That is related to land use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.377" offset="9644340">That is how integral land use is to the character and quality of a community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.162" offset="9659491">It stands based upon dictates from far away, people, Senators, who have no idea what's going on in southern Indiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="2575.341" offset="10452256">All of the justification, all of the justification mentioned by the Senate, the House, went to water pollution on steep slopes and mountain tops.</text>

            <text syncTime="2699.072" offset="10947119">How can the states evaluate whether or not they want to enact 522 or the prime farmland provisions when they don't know whether it's going to cost them $1 or $50 million?</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.464" offset="10996752">So, I would suggest to the Court that there is strong public policy behind proceedings with a decision of the taking issues, because the states are sitting back... some of them have enacted statutes; they're submitting programs; they need to know.</text>
