            <text syncTime="13.741" offset="147033">At issue here is a policy of the Federal Communications Commission under which the Commission in the courts are passing on applications for renewal or transfer of a radio station’s license.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.048" offset="212234">We'll not consider or take into account entertainment format changes that have occurred or -- or about to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.160" offset="248701">The Commission prefers to rely on market forces and competition among radio stations to serve the public interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.282" offset="293109">This policy was challenged in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit by various consumer groups who claim that the Commission’s policy did not sufficiently served public interests in providing diversity in -- in program format or in preserving unique entertainment programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.232" offset="396972">The Court of Appeals overturned the Commission’s policy holding that it was contrary to the Federal Communications Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.659" offset="434693">We granted certiorari and for the reasons that are detailed in an opinion filed today, we reverse as we understand the governing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.816" offset="471264">It may not require the Commission’s policy but certainly it does not forbid it.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.980" offset="499895">So the judgment is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.425" offset="505746">Mr. Justice Marshall filed a dissenting opinion and he is joined by Mr. Justice Brennan.</text>
