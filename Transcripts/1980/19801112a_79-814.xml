            <text syncTime="106.894" offset="574739">We are here asking that defendants be given the right, short of complete capitulation to extricate themselves from the burdens of unwarranted and costly litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="129.120" offset="663556">In this regard, we note Mr. Justice Stewart's admonition in the Christiansburg case, in which he noted that many defendants are small, mid-size employers, and that the expense of defending even a frivolous claim may become a strong disincentive to the exercise of their legal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.907" offset="754775">We submit that the public policy with respect to Title VII actions does indeed ask that it be easier to bring meritorious suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.026" offset="815170">But it is no less a public policy in Title VII actions that there should be a diminishment of unjustified suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.148" offset="851742">And we contend that this Court should not condone or permit the employer-defendant to be held under economic hostage of protracted litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="437.091" offset="1895490">Just very briefly, in terms of the background of this case, this was a Title VII case but there were two counts to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.026" offset="1931226">One was the Title VII, the second was the libel and slander.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.883" offset="1946690">That second count was dismissed on motion of defendant for summary judgment prior to the trial without objection by the counsel for the plaintiff, due to the fact I submit, that in deposition plaintiff admitted she had no evidence whatsoever as to any libel or slander statements by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.186" offset="2027879">As to the first count, the Title VII count which did go to trial, respondent by its briefs would have this Court believe that there was a close question of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.588" offset="2073436">For example, at page 13 of the brief, it was stated,</text>
            <text syncTime="485.758" offset="2090155">"as the District Court observed, Ms. August at least had presented a prima facie case. "</text>
            <text syncTime="492.226" offset="2116068">And at page 21 of the brief, the respondent's counsel notes,</text>
            <text syncTime="497.347" offset="2136548">"in this case, the District Court noted that Ms. August's evidence unrebutted would have been sufficient to support her claim. "</text>
            <text syncTime="503.813" offset="2162357">And the Court of Appeals supported the lower court opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.391" offset="2176672">I think a reading of the District Court's opinion and the Circuit Court's opinion as to the merits would find that that was not the case; that the lower court, the trial court itself, found that by cross-examination of the plaintiff and plaintiff's witnesses, there was equal evidence, equal number of cases, where blacks were favored or whites were disfavored.</text>

            <text syncTime="1245.690" offset="5129867">We say that the courts below attempted to rewrite Rule 68 and we submit that the courts below had no such authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.030" offset="5171245">And finally, we submit that what the Court did, below, was to equate Rule 68 with Rule 54(d), making the two of them basically the same, permitting for discretion to be exercised in either case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.413" offset="5240731">We noted in our briefs to this Court that under Rule 54(d), the Seventh Circuit has indicated that that discretion should be very sparingly exercised and that there should be a clear explication as to why costs were being denied a prevailing defendant and indicated that it was a form of penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.656" offset="5321711">And we felt that it was relevant because the Seventh Circuit had equated the two rules to look to the standards that that court itself had applied, when discretion was exercised under 54(d) and denying costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.883" offset="5386599">It is our belief, Your Honor, that the rule is clear on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.646" offset="5417737">That it does not permit a rewriting or a conditioning, and we note in that respect that this Court had cause to look at, I believe, Rule 23, when it came to class actions and it said in the Eisen case, we're not going to rewrite the rules for certain classes of plaintiffs as distinguished from others; that if there is a notice provision, the notice provision applies and that we don't look to the pocketbook of the plaintiffs to determine whether this rule is going to apply to this class as distinguished from that class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.552" offset="5565276">And we note also, in the General Telephone case, that this Court made it quite clear that it was not saying that the rules do not apply to EEOC actions and Title VII actions, that the... that all it was saying in that case was that an EEOC action was not a class action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2254.832" offset="9166413">If you look at the general provisions in the state practice, before... before Rule 68 was enacted, the general rule is that losing parties pay the winning parties' costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.606" offset="9237570">Statutes, like Rule 68, were enacted to prevent abuse of this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.276" offset="9264215">These statutes are the only explanatory reference in the advisory committee notes and should be incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.865" offset="9294622">Then in 1938, the Federal Rules were adopted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2306.546" offset="9373303">There was no reason that it should work any differently than it had before and if you look at the case law that's under those statutes, you'll see that... there is not one reported case where the defendant, where the prevailing... where the offer of judgment was used to give costs to a party that prevailed, where the party bringing the lawsuit hadn't won something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.285" offset="9492212">If you look at the disparity between those figures in all of those cases, they're very close.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.110" offset="9515513">That's because what those people did is, they took up the time of the Court, to figure out how much relief should be awarded and that's what the rule was designed to do, was to cut out the time that the Courts were going to spend when liability was known.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.931" offset="9586880">In any case, if the purpose of Rule 68 is to be served, the purpose being to encourage settlements and to avoid protracted litigation, offers have to be reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2396.167" offset="9731807">In fact, what there is, is the security... if the rule is going to operate the way they suggest... in knowing that your costs are ultimately covered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2684.460" offset="10884956">What the rule is designed to do is to prevent someone from prolonging litigation when a reasonable offer was made to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3449.448" offset="13944940">I think that one of the things that we should point out here is that in attempting to argue that Rule 68 applies only where the plaintiff prevails ignores, I think, two things: one, the language of the rule speaks in terms of obtaining judgment, and judgment under the rules is merely defined as a decree in any order from which an appeal lies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.201" offset="14063954">A judgment may be for someone, a judgment may be against someone, but all parties to an action receive that judgment at the end of the case from which judgment they may appeal if they so desire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.008" offset="14123095">I see nothing in the rules and in the definition of the term judgment, which would indicate that the judgment must be for someone or the judgment must be against someone to make a difference in terms of the application of Rule 68.</text>

            <text syncTime="3560.792" offset="14390276">We said, as I recall, $450 which shall include attorneys fees together with all costs accrued to date.</text>

            <text syncTime="3572.584" offset="14437400">We did, however, say that the one element, the potential element of cost which a Court may include in its discretion under 706(k), namely, attorneys fees, be a determined portion determined by the plaintiffs themselves, of the $450 offered.</text>

            <text syncTime="3589.766" offset="14506155">So your $450 of costs, except for attorneys fees, were to be covered in addition to the $450?</text>

            <text syncTime="3599.058" offset="14543353">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.167" offset="14547742">And if there were a contingency arrangement in effect then, and that was a one-third basis, then the plaintiff would have said to plaintiff's counsel, all right, you are entitled to one-third of that under our fee arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.991" offset="14595076">I think, going beyond the plain meaning of the words, however, I would like to point out, it simply is absurd in my opinion to say that a defendant who is totally innocent has no right to the application of Rule 68.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.109" offset="14671562">Counsel, on several occasions, counsel for plaintiff has made the point that what we are seeking is security in knowing that our costs are going to be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.620" offset="14713567">Why indeed not, if we know that we are completely innocent?</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.181" offset="14731853">Why indeed not, if the trial court found as it did, with no trouble whatsoever, that we were indeed innocent?</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.943" offset="14766857">Why shouldn't we have security in knowing in that situation that our costs will be covered?</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.394" offset="14792666">That is what we are seeking; that we believe is justice, and certainly in this case, it would have been speedier, certainly in this case it would have been less expensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.841" offset="14834462">The Seventh Circuit introduced the element of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.122" offset="14847627">That took away any possibility of certainty in making an offer of judgment, one wouldn't have the faintest idea whether it was going to prevail or not, because it would depend upon subsequent court determination as to reasonableness or good faith or genuineness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.804" offset="14910321">If we know for a certainty that our offer will protect us, if that offer is greater than the judgment ultimately prevailed, an innocent defendant has some protection under the rules which under plaintiff's contentions, would not obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.921" offset="14974791">We say, Your Honor, that the rule as we construe it, does consistently apply with Rule 54(d) and does completely fulfill the requirements of Rule 1.</text>
