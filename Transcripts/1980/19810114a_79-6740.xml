            <text syncTime="5.785" offset="168373">Mr. Sindel, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard H. Sindel</label>
            <text syncTime="8.670" offset="179867">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.022" offset="189271">In July of 1978 Robert Bullington filed a motion to quash the jury panel to be commenced against him under this Court's decision in Taylor v. Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.913" offset="236919">It was contended at that time that the statutes constructed in Jackson County violated those provisions in that case in that they excluded women unconstitutionally from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.804" offset="284461">Five months later he proceeded to trial for his life, at which time the jury came back with a verdict of guilty, the guilt phase of the trial, and rendered a sentence of life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.397" offset="338796">The question now before this Court is whether or not the State of Missouri can seize upon the opportunity to take the reversal of that decision of guilt pursuant to this Court's decision in Duren v. Missouri and resubject and resentence this individual to a trial for his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.310" offset="426463">Throughout the proceedings counsel for the defendant and the defendant persisted in claiming that to proceed to trial with the jury panel so composed violated his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.106" offset="493650">The trial court, following the mandates of the Missouri Supreme Court, denied these motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.426" offset="514966">He proceeded to the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.878" offset="528759">Subsequent to the trial his motion for a new trial was sustained and a new trial was ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.382" offset="554777">The State filed a notice of aggravation of circumstances pursuant to Missouri statutory guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.936" offset="581003">At that time the petitioner filed a notice to quash those aggravating circumstances, contending that he was subject to the Double Jeopardy Clause and that any retrial or relitigation of an issue that had already been determined by a jury was precluded by that clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.913" offset="652892">He also at that time contended that it would unnecessarily and needlessly chill his rights to a jury trial, that it would be... that any sentence of death at the second proceeding would be excessive and disproportionate to any sentence, the sentence of life at the first proceeding, and that the statutory provisions under which the State intended to proceed were vague and overbroad under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="154.631" offset="763756">Mr. Sindel, what if your client had been convicted by the jury or the judge and sentenced to the death penalty in the first proceeding and it was set aside on the Duren ground?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_h_sindel" startTime="172.628" stopTime="238.384">
            <label>Mr. Richard H. Sindel</label>
            <text syncTime="172.628" offset="835750">I think that at that particular time since there had been no determination by the jury of an acquittal or that death was not the appropriate sentence in this particular case, and a jury is specifically instructed in Missouri as to what they need to find.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.054" offset="901474">They need to find the existence of an aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt, and that that aggravating circumstance is not outweighed by any mitigating circumstances that are presented, either statutory or non-statutory.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.028" offset="949330">If at that time the jury had obviously determined that in fact an aggravating circumstance did exist, then I think the State would not be precluded, because it would not be tantamount or substantially equivalent to a verdict of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.602" offset="1007635">In this particular case the State had one full fair opportunity to present to the jury their version and why this defendant should suffer with his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.011" offset="1057268">And at this, they presented all the evidence they wanted to, they presented all the evidence that they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.765" offset="1084331">In fact, they have conceded that they have no additional evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="569.666" offset="2423890">However, I think that it's clear that if a jury comes back with a life imprisonment sentence, that they must have found that death was in fact inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.422" offset="2454923">There is very little that they could have otherwise found.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.558" offset="2471433">The jury was death-qualified pursuant to Witherspoon, so there's obviously no people that are sitting on the jury that are so constituted that they could not impose the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.699" offset="2516050">These are individuals who indicated under questioning that they could in fact impose the death penalty in the proper case under the proper circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.454" offset="2547083">The only thing that can be concluded is that in fact this was not the proper case or the proper circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.125" offset="2569758">Now, we would also contend that any sentence other than the sentence of life would have to be excessive and disproportionate under the Court's earlier decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.881" offset="2612703">There's no question that the jury had the opportunity to weigh this particular defendant and in the vital interest of the community and the vital interest of the defendant, they determined that the only appropriate sentence was life.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.891" offset="2668814">So under those circumstances a retrial and allowing another jury to determine if the first jury was correct, and the Supreme Court of Missouri dealt with this by saying, we can't say whether or not the jury below was a maverick jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.166" offset="2725865">You don't really know.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.268" offset="2734329">But if you allow, if you allow the Supreme Court of Missouri to say that, then every time a life sentence comes down, they can say, that could have been the result of a maverick jury, and then the comparison test that is so vital to this Court's decisions in the holding that Georgia's statutes in Gregg, where they'd said that this appellate review is one of the vital elements that's necessary under the Eighth Amendment to insure and to guarantee both to the community and to the defendant that his rights under that amendment will be respected, will be lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.525" offset="2883332">I think it's important to point out in terms of the double jeopardy argument and in terms of every argument throughout this case that it is a death penalty case, and there's no question as to how unique it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.118" offset="2941741">This is why perhaps Stroud and Pearce and Chaffin need to be reconsidered.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.122" offset="2961699">They did not provide in those cases for the strict statutory guidelines for the sentence's discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.776" offset="2988344">These guidelines are to focus the sentence on the particular circumstances of the case in such a way that we can assure ourselves, assure society, and assure the defendant that he is getting the benefit of all the constitutional rights, because it is a unique penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="752.503" offset="3155214">First, this Court recognized in distinguishing... in the Gardner case they distinguished Williams v. New York, a death penalty case, and they say, well, we think that due process requires that there be an adversarial proceeding and that the lawyer be disclosed the contents of a presentence investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.381" offset="3226790">Now, there was no overruling of the Williams case because in U.S. v. Grayson that case was again upheld, and they said, the court can determine from the defendant's testimony if they believe that he was committing perjury, and they can use that, in fact, in sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.890" offset="3284781">So there's no question that you do not have to overrule.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.359" offset="3294708">But it is perhaps necessary to reconsider the decisions in those cases for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.663" offset="3319890">One, those cases took place prior to this Court's decision in Gregg, recognizing how unique and irrevocable and final the sentence of death is, and two, the idea that the sentencing phase of this trial is exactly like a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.641" offset="3387808">There are opening statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.343" offset="3398571">There is the introduction of evidence, and the taking of testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.195" offset="3414035">There are instructions to the jury, there are arguments of counsel, there is then deliberation by that jury, and a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.484" offset="3447159">This is the functional equivalent of an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.353" offset="3462623">If it walks, talks, and looks like a duck, it's a duck.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.840" offset="3480595">There can be no question that this defendant had to undergo the ordeals and the anxiety and the pressures that exist at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.850" offset="3544648">Now, this Court in Breed recognized the existence of those pressures and that ordeal in a juvenile court case and they said, well, then, it doesn't have perhaps as many pressures as a situation where you're on trial in a felony case, but it's still enough, and we recognize that the defendant has a right to be protected for having to undergo those ordeals again.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.096" offset="3629598">There can be no question, the magnitude of the ordeal when you are being tried for your life, and there can be no question that this needs to be protected, that the defendant needs to have the protection from this Court of having to undergo that experience again, and that the Double Jeopardy Clause guarantees it to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.897" offset="3724788">In this Court's decision in Di Francesco there was remarks concerning the finality of judgments, and we are here talking about the finality of judgments, for that jury did render a final decision, a final verdict, and the State had their opportunity to make their case for death.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.275" offset="3798349">And the defendant in that case, unlike the defendant in Di Francesco, had a right and was entitled to expect the finality and the repose that is guaranteed to him under the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1704.076" offset="6961568">Well, if you assume that the jury imposed life because they found there were no aggravating circumstances you have a problem about pressing the same aggravating circumstances, if you just assumed that that's what the jury did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.501" offset="7015276">I would take your case as not so clear either if the jury said there are both aggravating and mitigating circumstances, but the mitigating circumstances outweigh the aggravating circumstances and the State on retrial says, we're going to present precisely the same evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1736.997" offset="7093225">I believe my position is easier because of the way the jury system is set up, the instructions under the general verdict type of approach to the specific verdicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.938" offset="7132932">But I think that you still need to look at the policy behind why we apply double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.524" offset="7159368">We apply double jeopardy not really because of the finality, or repose, or the other things that we've talked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.162" offset="7181833">I submit that this Court has suggested or found that we apply double jeopardy in order basically to protect the individual against government oppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.118" offset="7225719">The Double Jeopardy Clause is in a way an exception to our basic legal system, which is to find the truth by having your day in court and making sure on appeal that that day in court was done properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.711" offset="7276083">And under that system you would say, well, the State should be able to check and have an appeal to make sure that was done properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.198" offset="7306071">But we cannot protect against government oppression and still do that so we make a blanket exception to that and put it in the Bill of Rights and say, okay, the State only gets one shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.791" offset="7364377">But we do give exceptions to that by saying, if the defendant appeals, the slate is wiped clean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.278" offset="7390290">We don't say that in a way of vindictiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.980" offset="7401157">We say that to emphasize the fact that it is only the defendant that can set aside a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.319" offset="7430519">And of course he wouldn't be interested in setting aside an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.121" offset="7445670">So that when you would take this policy and you try to apply it to the sentencing procedures, or sentencing at all, as was recognized in several of the recent cases, it doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.428" offset="7494989">Because you have said, or this Court has said that there's no absolute bar against increasing a sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.434" offset="7522992">The only concern we have against increasing a sentence is to protect against vindictiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.136" offset="7541800">And we say, in a judge sentencing situation, we have to do that by adding the Pearce limitations, but in the jury sentencing situation we don't have that concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.676" offset="7579939">There is not that concern about vindictiveness, so we don't need to have the double jeopardy applying to sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.432" offset="7610972">Therefore, I think this procedure does not make this into an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.252" offset="7630199">Bifurcation is for the protection of the defendant, it is not meant to give the sentencing a greater finality than it ever had before.</text>

            <text syncTime="2618.514" offset="10619234">But that's a trial court decision that we're going to try to change the trial court's mind on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.483" offset="10639191">I don't think disproportionateness applies, and excessiveness is also mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.572" offset="10671479">I don't think that applies either, again for the same reason as I've indicated in the Proffitt decision where a death sentence following a life cannot per se be excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.979" offset="10717141">It may be, but you have to look at more than just the one other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.681" offset="10731978">There's a concern here that this decision would chill the right of the defendant to seek a jury trial in his second case, and of course the petitioner relies on the Jackson decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.174" offset="10781924">It's our position that this Court has cited that issue in respondent's favor in Chaffin where, although it is concerned about that, it felt that those difficult decisions sometimes have to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.999" offset="10833229">And it distinguished Jackson, in that in Jackson it was stated that there was no other purpose or result of that procedure than to chill the defendant's right to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.104" offset="10873666">It's our position that there is another purpose or result in this procedure, and that is the stated and approved government, or State interest, in having jury sentencing, and that as long as you have jury sentencing, and as long as that is considered a legitimate State interest, then that is a legitimate State purpose or result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.637" offset="10967812">Also, I would indicate that although Petitioner indicates that the defendant would be absolutely precluded from getting the death penalty if he waives his jury, that is not necessarily so, because he relies on the fact that he would then come under the Pearce provisions and the judge could not give death unless something new had arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.402" offset="11058822">But I don't think that we would ever be absolutely sure of that until the moment or sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.222" offset="11078153">I'm not implying that anything new has arisen which would cause the judge in this particular case to give the death penalty but for the Court to find that this chilled his right because he would be absolutely precluded from getting the death penalty by the judge would not be accurate, because there may be those cases where the judge could in fact give the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.587" offset="11171567">So the decision is not the decision as it was in Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.455" offset="11187031">Petitioner also asked this Court basically to rule that the two aggravating circumstances here are too vague and overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.597" offset="11239590">And the Missouri court has ignored this Court's rulings about the narrowing of the aggravating circumstance that was decided in Godfrey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.670" offset="11287864">And certainly that is one of the circumstances we're using in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.956" offset="11301030">I would merely point out that the decision below in the Missouri Supreme Court was handed down before your decision in Godfrey, that the Missouri Supreme Court has not had the opportunity to decide any death penalty cases yet and has not had the opportunity to follow this Court's decision, and so we would ask that this Court give the Missouri Supreme Court the opportunity to constitutionally narrow those aggravating circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2953.414" offset="11958897">I think that this is one of the reasons that Di Francesco needs to be overruled and this Court needn't concern itself with overruling the Di Francesco case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.186" offset="11989931">In fact, in oral arguments in that case, Mr. Frey who so ably represented the U.S. Government indicated that this was a question of legal air.</text>

Alabama recognizes, although no other case recognizes, that lesser included offenses in a death case must be submitted, and that is because of the necessity for that higher requirement of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.630" offset="12359720">I also believe that in applying death, it says that to apply the death penalty in the Beck case, there must be this elevated procedure that is followed, and there's no question that it has to be followed under the Eighth Amendment prescriptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.257" offset="12426280">I think that in Di Francesco the argument that was presented is consistent somewhat with Professor Westen's argument in his article that's quoted there, "The Triptych of Double Jeopardy", the idea that there are three things that Double Jeopardy Clause is to protect, the finality of jury verdicts of acquittal, the lawful administration of sentence, and third, the expectation of finality or repose that exists in the defendant after he has undergone the ordeal of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.594" offset="12547593">I would suggest that if you use the Wayne technique that Professor Westen suggests, and also we cite to a new article that he has written in our supplemental brief, distinguishing Di Francesco, in which he talked specifically about this case, that argument would hold water, and that Di Francesco needn't be distinguished as well as Stroud and Pearce needn't be overruled to sustain a decision in this particular case that Mr. Bullington need not undergo the ordeal of a trial again.</text>
