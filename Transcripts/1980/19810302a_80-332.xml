            <text syncTime="1383.755" offset="5680965">Now, the District Court did not find double-celling to be per se unconstitutional but found it to be unconstitutional when it was combined with factors that naturally flowed from the practice of double-celling or from the fact of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.418" offset="5759646">The court found that the inmates were long-term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.807" offset="5769259">Well, they were prison inmates, and they were convicted of felonies.</text>

            <text syncTime="1414.789" offset="5805099">It also found that the average floor space available to each inmate in each cell was half, and it found the practice of double-celling to have been of long-term duration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.534" offset="5852119">The Court's fifth finding, that most double-celled inmates spend most of their time in their cells directly contradicts the evidence in the case, and the Court's previous finding that 75 percent of the inmates can be out of their cells from 6:30 in the morning to 9:30 at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.449" offset="5911783">That's 15 hours each and every day.</text>

            <text syncTime="1449.197" offset="5942816">Now, the question of double-celling inmates... the question here simply boils down to, does a prison inmate have a right to private sleeping quarters?</text>

            <text syncTime="1477.154" offset="6054620">The question of double-celling prison inmates has been dealt with by four other federal appellate courts.</text>
