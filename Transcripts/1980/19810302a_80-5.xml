            <text syncTime="5.904" offset="163212">Mr. Eytan, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mattaniah_eytan" startTime="39.291" stopTime="288.587">
            <label>Mr. Mattaniah Eytan</label>
            <text syncTime="39.291" offset="296750">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="42.260" offset="308557">Richard John McCarty, the husband in a California divorce action, appeals the decision of the California Court of Appeal, First Appellate District; which we've had affirmed a Superior Court determination that the husband's expectancy in receiving Army retired pay should be awarded in part to his ex-spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.702" offset="458395">The Court of Appeal took the position that the Superior Court had properly applied California law... and that's a crucial matter in this entire case... and that having applied California law the expectancy in retired pay was indivisible and then divided the Army retired pay pursuant to established California formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.673" offset="598203">The husband contended then and contends now that federal law prohibits such a result, and federal law not only applies but preempts California from making such a determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.183" offset="656299">The facts in the case can very briefly be summarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.920" offset="675212">The parties were married in Oregon in 1957 and were divorced in California, or at least they were separated in California, in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.310" offset="724740">When the parties were married the husband was in medical school in Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.148" offset="748146">He was a domiciliary of Oregon, as was his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.850" offset="762983">In his fourth year of medical school, the husband joined the Army and remained in the Army for the entire period up until the divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.974" offset="803421">After spending one year in Oregon he was transferred by the military to Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia, Texas, Hawaii, California, staying in each place for a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.616" offset="853994">Before the Superior Court the husband contended that he was an Oregon domiciliary and that California could not apply its quasi-community property regime, which is encompassed in Section 4803 of the California Civil Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.827" offset="926823">That's a somewhat unusual provision which provides that property which is acquired by either party to a marriage while domiciled outside of California shall be treated as community property if the party would have been domiciled in California at the time of the acquisition of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.929" offset="1039254">Once property is classified as quasi-community property, it then is treated as community property.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.183" offset="1068302">The issue before this Court is not the distinctive to community property matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.504" offset="1093589">The issue comes up in a wide variety of contexts whenever a community property state or another state that under equitable division of property, in the context of a divorce seeks to divide Army retired pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.716" offset="1158373">Now there is a threshold jurisdictional issue in this case, and by explaining what happened before the lower courts I can deal with that as a preliminary matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.439" offset="1205288">Before the Superior Court the husband submitted the decision in Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo of the California Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.231" offset="1260459">That decision was not terribly dissimilar from the decision of this Court in the same case, which came out sometime later.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="288.587" offset="1293896">Under California law, assume hypothetically that he had been a physician for General Motors or Du Pont all this time and had precisely the same experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.815" offset="1358784">Ultimately, would his pension be subject to division under the California community property law?</text>

            <text syncTime="311.868" offset="1386996">What makes this case so distinctive is that the California Court here improperly assumes that California law applies of its own force.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.610" offset="1437987">In your example, Mr. Chief Justice, there should be no question that California law has everything to say and federal law has nothing to say about the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.901" offset="1479156">Federal law tells us nothing about the pension rights of someone who works for General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.055" offset="1499741">What we have here, however, is a very major federal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.376" offset="1521057">We have here the exercise by the Congress of elaborate legislation pursuant to congressional war power authorities to raise and support armies.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.231" offset="1560449">Article I, Section 8, Clause 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.099" offset="1571943">The Congress has passed legislation which covers in great detail all elements of Army pay, Army retired pay, various annuity programs, and the like.</text>

            <text syncTime="558.144" offset="2372126">He doesn't have to die for his spouse to get a benefit, nor does he have to die for his ex-spouse to get a benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.517" offset="2405563">The only requirement in that regard is that they must have been married for ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.071" offset="2423848">In addition, there are separate benefits, of course, for the widow.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.106" offset="2439940">And with respect to social security widow's benefits there is an offset configuration which applies to other programs that operate in conjunction with social security and those are the annuity programs that I believe you had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.651" offset="2510157">There are annuity programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.351" offset="2516949">There is also social security for the widow, and there's a combination, and at the top level if the widow gets the maximum amount of the annuity, she doesn't get social security by an offset and she doesn't get the maximum amount of the annuity she gets from social security.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.398" offset="2589151">But interestingly, there's no offset as against the ex-spouse at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.700" offset="2610363">The offset is only as against the widow.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.969" offset="2623424">And the annuity program, you're correct, is only to the widow.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.122" offset="2636067">Social security is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.538" offset="2641710">Now, the main point in all this, if one can cut through the heart, is that obviously California law cannot apply of its own force and effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.632" offset="2698030">This is a program established by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.184" offset="2712240">This is a federal entitlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.869" offset="2719032">There are very important considerations both to the national program involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.606" offset="2745990">There are very practical, direct consequences, and as Hisquierdo taught us and perhaps, more importantly, as we know from Clearfield Trust and its multiple progeny, that where important federal programs, important interests of the federal government are implicated, are involved, we look to federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.305" offset="2840763">Now what does federal law tell us in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="678.590" offset="2853928">If we had a civil service situation here, if we had a civil service husband, we would have direct federal law telling us what to do because the Congress has in Title V, Section 8345(j)(1) told us that you defer to the states and whatever the state rule is, you apply it.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.635" offset="2922056">The same thing is now true for the Foreign Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.337" offset="2936893">But the Congress has not done that for the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.639" offset="2950059">They have not passed a direct statement of their intention as to what federal law ought to apply and I would submit to you, the husband would submit to you, that the formula that the Congress has adopted for civil service cannot apply to the military, and I don't think I'm overreaching by saying I don't see how the Congress could pass such a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.773" offset="3050683">And the reason for that is that the husband's status as a retired Army man doesn't mean that he's resigned his commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.379" offset="3089030">An Army man who retires remains a commissioned officer in the Army.</text>

            <text syncTime="790.696" offset="3302294">Let me show you why.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.996" offset="3307519">We know that an Army retiree remains subject to recall at any time, and any time means any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.738" offset="3346493">It doesn't mean national emergency, it doesn't mean war, it means any time that the Secretary of the service says so.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.742" offset="3374497">And apropos of that, on December 12, 1980, the Congress reaffirmed this insistence that the Army retiree can be called up at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.216" offset="3424443">I've mentioned in the reply brief that there is new legislation, so we're not talking about any "porey" scheme going back a long time or some disused statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.757" offset="3462581">Now, at any time means that despite the fact that we have an all-volunteer Army today, as to the Army retiree the impact of this statute is conscriptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.933" offset="3527261">He has to go, and the reason he has to go is because he is still an officer in the Army.</text>

            <text syncTime="871.582" offset="3625899">Now, the reason he loses his retired pay is because retired pay is not pay for, it's not deferred payment for past services.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.939" offset="3675323">The federal rule, enunciated in some 16 cases which I call to the Court's attention, including five opinions of this Court, is that retired pay is current pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.347" offset="3728926">It's reduced pay for reduced services.</text>

            <text syncTime="907.639" offset="3770095">It said that whatever the retirement benefits are, those are deferred payments for past services; and once it makes that decision, it treats Army pay the way it does the General Motors official.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mattaniah Eytan</label>
            <text syncTime="945.930" offset="3923277">Certainly it can, and Congress has permitted that in express terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.418" offset="3945220">What the Congress did in that regard was really quite drastic, because in 1975 the Congress changed the whole scheme of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.206" offset="3988374">And had you asked me the question, what could the wife have done prior to 1975, I would have said that the wife would have a very tough time enforcing any California support order.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.949" offset="4039365">But, look, in 1975 the Congress said that when it comes to support, any kind of support... and there's a long list in the statute; I'm talking about Title 42 of the Code, Section 659(a) and especially Section 662(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="994.947" offset="4119300">What the Congress said there was that when it comes to support payments, the wife armed with a state court award may proceed to garnishee the funds directly from the financial officer of the appropriate federal agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.658" offset="4194219">And ever since then we've had wives from California and elsewhere doing just that, and elaborate regulations implementing that statute have now been published.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.549" offset="4237791">So that matter has been taken care of by Congress in the very limited area of support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.918" offset="4259212">And what the Congress did, just so that no one could mistake it, it distinguished carefully between support and property interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.225" offset="4296410">It stated in Section 662(c) of that legislation that when we say support, we mean alimony, alimony pendente lite and all the rest of it, child support payments, but we don't mean community property awards, we don't mean property divisions pursuant to the decrees of state courts that have equitable division; a very careful distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.507" offset="4397556">So that, as we look at what the Congress did in 1975 you see that there as well as in social security amendments it had the spousal interest in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.149" offset="4444159">Hisquierdo put it this way: when the Congress provided for a spousal award for the railroad retiree, it had something like a community concept in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.206" offset="4488358">Indeed, I may point out a third instance where the Congress had support, and only support, in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.610" offset="4513958">There is legislation that says that the Army man may make an allotment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.030" offset="4539662">Again, for support purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.799" offset="4546768">Everything deals with support, not property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.168" offset="4560247">And what is the distinction?</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.984" offset="4567457">We're talking here about property rights, property rights that have no connection whatever with need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.922" offset="4591280">My opponent essentially makes the argument, as do the amicus briefs, that spouses, ex-spouses have great need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.997" offset="4639555">Their social security payments may come late, they have to wait a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.866" offset="4655019">They need more; they get the runaround, or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.501" offset="4669543">But that's a question of need, again, that's a question of support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.805" offset="4694725">The Congress has directed its attention to that several times and it's come out with a formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.309" offset="4716773">That formula now gives the spouse more than she ever had, because the Congress went so far as to allow the United States to be sued directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.482" offset="4753448">But let me come again to what I consider to be the control issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.736" offset="4778526">This case is much simpler than Hisquierdo ever was, because in this case if we apply federal law as the California courts should have, the California courts should have stated that under federal law Army retired pay is current wages, reduced current wages for reduced services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.953" offset="4879359">If that is so, the whole conceptual underpinning for the community property position evaporates, it doesn't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.826" offset="4918856">Now, what does the California court do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.511" offset="4929618">It stubbornly applies California law in the sense that it says, let us see whether there is any express statement by Congress that bars us from first characterizing the property and then dividing it and deciding to do anything we want to do with respect to that property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.226" offset="5020420">Now, that's not the right rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.759" offset="5026585">The right rule has to be, what does federal law tell us that the appropriate rule should be?</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.982" offset="5055424">I would concede that the federal rule might well be that courts should defer to state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.171" offset="5092204">That might be the correct rule, but that would then be a federal rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.040" offset="5107669">In our case the federal rule is clear beyond peradventure, because we had this Court speaking five times and for a hundred years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.930" offset="5147270">The first decision on this was in 1881, and it stated very clearly that an Army man who was retired still wears the uniform, is still subject to the Code, the Code of Military Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.357" offset="5209024">He gets his pay for staying in the service and jumping to attention and going back into the service when he's directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.761" offset="5238595">Now, if the California court had done that, that would have been the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.713" offset="5254373">And I wouldn't be here talking about the anti-assignment statute, the Social Security Act amendments, the spousal awards, and all that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.103" offset="5291989">What the California court does, however, is it ignores the federal law, it gives it the back of the hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.340" offset="5320933">There is not a single intelligent analysis in any community property state as to the large body of federal law that says, look, this is not deferred compensation for past services; this is compensation for your staying eligible for recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.354" offset="5400972">It's your compensation for doing all kinds of other things, which are set out in the brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1406.976" offset="5767417">Mr. Chief Justice; may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.614" offset="5782046">I would like to ask the Court's indulgence for one moment while I read to you one short sentence quoting Mr. Justice Gardner, from the case of In re Marriage of Brantner, when he said,--</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.373" offset="5841083">"A woman is not a breeding cow to be nurtured during her years of fecundity, then conveniently and economically converted to cheap steaks when past her prime. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.216" offset="5900433">I think nothing is more appropriate than this particular phrase, when we are talking about the plight of the military wife, because the military wife's situation is unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.191" offset="5956335">Unlike her sisters who are not military wives, she not only is supposed to be the companion, the homemaker, to bear and raise children, but the military wife has a very unique position in the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.318" offset="6028851">From the moment that she marries a military man, she becomes part of the military as much as if she herself were wearing that uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.245" offset="6080573">She assumes the role of her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.714" offset="6094366">If her husband is a lieutenant, she is the wife of a lieutenant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.149" offset="6108159">She for all intents and purposes has to be subservient to the wife of the colonel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.070" offset="6131773">And so it goes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1509.860" offset="6179003">Yes, I think it is, it is very definitely so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.562" offset="6193840">But I think that what we have to do at the present time, Mr. Justice, is we have to recognize the fact that these women do serve and they are expected to serve, they are expected to participate in social functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.624" offset="6257997">They are even given guides,</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.809" offset="6266774">"how to be a good military wife. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.926" offset="6275238">They are left alone for months at a time; they lead nomadic lives; their moves are approximately two years apart, and this is extremely important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.152" offset="6328110">So they cannot develop their own careers, they cannot develop their own potential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.722" offset="6350470">They are required to stabilize the children, because I think we all know and recognize that the children of military families do have peculiar problems, they cannot have any continuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.928" offset="6395297">So this is part of their function again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.214" offset="6404387">And they cannot fulfill, Justices, the American dream of owning a home, their own home, because for all intents and purposes when you have to get up and move every couple of years, forgetting for a moment the fact that their incomes are extremely low, they simply do not have the time or the opportunity to purchase a home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.395" offset="6493099">They have a lower standard of living.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.181" offset="6504279">For example, Dr. McCarty, who was a Board-certified cardiologist, had an income of $2,596.51 a month, $30,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.755" offset="6558614">And I think we all know that cardiologists can earn upwards of $150,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.559" offset="6581811">These people are giving up something for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.963" offset="6599365">They are working today for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.332" offset="6612844">You may recall... if I may direct your attention to the fact that after almost 20 years of marriage, what did Dr. and Mrs. McCarty actually accumulate?</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.704" offset="6654327">$13,000 in assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.174" offset="6668224">Two automobiles, $200 in the bank, and a couple of thousand dollars that somebody owed to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.912" offset="6691212">That is what they acquired after almost twenty years of marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.280" offset="6708661">Why do people do this?</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.399" offset="6717125">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.882" offset="6723081">Well, patriotism, perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.101" offset="6731963">But actually I think we all know why they do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.553" offset="6745755">They're in the military because they know that from the moment that they start, twenty years later they are going to have an income for life.</text>

            <text syncTime="1740.608" offset="7101961">And you see, this is not their entire argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.292" offset="7108753">In the first place, they never actually raised the statute at the time that we were in court previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.214" offset="7136443">The first time that the appellant here raised the unconstitutionality of the statute was when he filed this particular brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.819" offset="7170820">He never mentioned it before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.436" offset="7177298">However, let's forget that for just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.871" offset="7190986">Let's treat this as if this were a sur petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.473" offset="7201435">We then get involved in the supremacy requirement, because after all, the only question here is, has the federal scheme actually mandated that the state courts can no longer act over pensions?</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.202" offset="7268309">And there are two requirements, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.302" offset="7276773">One of them is, there must be an actual conflict or unambiguous mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.356" offset="7301014">Now, we don't have that here, because there is no conflict at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.343" offset="7316897">It is not even mentioned in any of the federal statutes, and there has to be some interference with a federal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.198" offset="7352319">And Mr. Justice, this is precisely why I think it's very important for the Court to understand that, because, you see, they keep on saying that this country is going to fall apart if the ladies, or the wives, or the spouses are able to obtain their portion of the pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.975" offset="7419401">And nothing could be further from the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.827" offset="7430895">The fact of the matter is, Mr. Justice, that it's exactly the opposite way around.</text>

            <text syncTime="1868.058" offset="7611767">Their position, as I understand it is, that Congress has said that the pension or the retirement pay should belong to the retired officer to the same extent in every state in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1889.637" offset="7698075">In the first place, insofar as what they have said, I believe that it is their statement that they are talking about preemption, and it is our position that there has not been a preemption because the Congress has not spoken about it one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.314" offset="7760769">Now, insofar as the second portion is concerned, I believe that if the Congress wished to speak on that subject and wished to have a separate rule for military divorces, then Congress can certainly do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.424" offset="7821269">There is absolutely no constitutional prohibition saying that they may not have a federal divorce law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.862" offset="7850944">But the fact of the matter is, Mr. Justice, that there is no federal divorce law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1943.403" offset="7913115">One of the... in the first place, Hisquierdo had some very, very specific wording in that particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.359" offset="7944985">They talk about, for example, that there not, be not any assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.680" offset="7966301">And in the present case, and in the military retirement cases, there is a specific provision that there can be an assignment of an officer's wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.070" offset="8011858">The Hisquierdo statute talks about the fact that it is not subject to attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.474" offset="8041429">And in the present case there is a specific provision for attachment in the case of support, and Congress has in fact aided the wife in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.615" offset="8086046">Third, in the Hisquierdo case they talk about the legal process not being mentioned in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.138" offset="8124080">In other words, it is actually by case law only that we're talking about legal process and, as far as we're concerned here... in Hisquierdo it is not subject to legal process, but in the present type of a situation the legal process is not even mentioned in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.986" offset="8211538">So that, for all intents and purposes Hisquierdo is easily differentiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.557" offset="8233795">And another thing, sir, is about anticipation of payments, again in Hisquierdo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.276" offset="8256678">And again I'd like to point out to this Court that it is not mentioned in the military situation at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3202.487" offset="12949524">Suppose she gets the money and then she decides to pledge it to a financial institution or suppose she decides to give it to her second husband if there is one, never mind the specific fact here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.711" offset="12998425">The point is that once you get into the property business you allow the states to determine that the wives can dispose of it by testamentary disposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="3227.269" offset="13048580">Look, you have a new case here, In re Miller, as to which cert is pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.589" offset="13069896">The Miller court from Montana decided that the wife has such a marvelous property interest in this that she can give this to any person she wants by testamentary disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.730" offset="13114513">Does anyone really believe that the Congress intended that the Army retiree, perhaps languishing in a nursing home, is going to share his retired pay with a second husband who secured it by testamentary disposition?</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.490" offset="13181491">Has anyone really considered that the Army intended for Army retired pay to be so abused as a property interest that husbands who have their retired pay taken away from them in substantial portions have to seek out bankruptcy relief?</text>

            <text syncTime="3279.737" offset="13258500">If you take a look at the reply memorandum you'll see the cases cited there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.122" offset="13276054">Most importantly, I think that the statement that there's no anti-assignment statute here a la Hisquierdo is rot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.913" offset="13315238">There clearly is an anti-assignment statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.949" offset="13327359">It goes back to the days before California entered the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.151" offset="13340106">The exact text has changed from time to time but the essential point is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.305" offset="13364766">There is as good an anti-assignment statute here, as in Hisquierdo, and when you consider that it's the United States Government that has all the benefits in this area, the pay, the retired pay, the social security, the annuity programs, obviously an anti-assignment statute in these circumstances for Army pay which the Congress protected as much as it protected regular pay... it's all in the same statute... cannot mean that someone can take active duty pay, retired pay, because of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.942" offset="13499349">Federal law applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.236" offset="13508439">Federal law is very clear; the wife has no interest.</text>
