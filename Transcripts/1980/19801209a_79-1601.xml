            <text syncTime="90.651" offset="504767">This defendant and his two codefendants by the names of David Gallegos and Salvador Vargas were convicted in a California court of the first-degree murder of a man by the name of Leonard Arias.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.190" offset="574879">The three defendants were members of the "Mexican Mafia" prison gang.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.610" offset="596613">Victim Arias was a member of a rival gang.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.171" offset="614794">There was evidence introduced that these three defendants accepted an assignment from the Mexican Mafia hierarchy to kill Mr. Arias because Mr. Arias had stabbed another Mexican Mafia member at the California prison at San Quentin.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.259" offset="683131">There was further evidence that they armed themselves and that they stated their intention to kill Mr. Arias.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas A. Brady</label>
            <text syncTime="151.829" offset="749482">It occurred in one of the inmate dormitories at the California Correctional Institution at Tehachapi.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.999" offset="778112">At the time there was a correctional officer present in this dormitory.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.636" offset="804652">He estimated that there were between 30 and 35 inmates there at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.682" offset="820848">Although both the prosecution and the defense interviewed many of these inmates, only three of them would ever admit that they had witnessed the killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.475" offset="860032">Each of these three were hesitant to some greater or less degree to admit that they'd seen anything and hesitant to admit that they were able to identify anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.393" offset="895663">The three eyewitnesses who testified at trial were inmates and were residents of this particular dormitory.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.701" offset="944982">The first of them was an inmate by the name of Paul Childress.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.808" offset="957416">The defendant does not now contend that his identification testimony was improperly admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.540" offset="984270">Indeed, Mr. Childress testified that he previously knew the defendant and Mr. Gallegos and he was able on the day after the killing to identify them by name, and to select their pictures, as well as a photograph of the third defendant from a group of several hundred pictures shown to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.689" offset="1060861">The other witnesses were inmates by the name of Rigoberto Almengor and Jay Allen.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.138" offset="1090641">Both of them testified that they were walking with the victim when he was suddenly set upon by three men armed with knives who appeared to have been waiting for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.024" offset="1138184">Both of them testified that this fatal struggle took several minutes, perhaps as long as four minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.443" offset="1171934">Almengor testified that at one point during it he struggled briefly with the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.628" offset="1196698">He made eye contact with the defendant, the defendant broke off his attack on the victim and commenced an attack on Mr. Almongor.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.780" offset="1229299">This lasted a short time.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.765" offset="1237240">Thereafter Mr. Almengor backed off from the defendant, they faced each other from a very short distance, Mr. Almengor then turned his attention back to the victim, but once again he and Mr. Mata backed off.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.226" offset="1311010">They faced each other from a short distance, and at this point Almengor indicated that he wanted no part of this struggle that was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.785" offset="1345283">Mr. Allen testified that he too struggled briefly with one of the other men but then he backed off a short distance from the struggle and began yelling for help.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.685" offset="1400871">On the day of the killing Mr. Almengor was shown several hundred pictures of inmates at the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.791" offset="1441309">From these he was able to narrow it down to a group of four of them which he said were similar in appearance to the men he had seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.723" offset="1484985">It should be emphasized that his identifications at this time were not positive.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.986" offset="1510063">In fact, he selected more pictures at the time than he said there were assailants.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.937" offset="1533887">Mr. Allen was also interviewed this day.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.608" offset="1544545">He stated that he did not want to get involved and for this reason he told the prison authorities he was able to identify no one.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.480" offset="1576100">Because of this they showed him no pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.697" offset="1588953">In the next few days after this there is evidence in the record that a riot was occurring at the prison and that the investigation was postponed for a short time because of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.709" offset="1637018">Finally, on the 27th of October, approximately eight days after the killing, the three witnesses were shown a group of 24 pictures of inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.456" offset="1683934">This was People's Exhibit 23, introduced at trial, and it as well as People's Exhibit 24, which I'll mention in a moment, has been brought before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.106" offset="1726566">Mr. Childress was able to identify all three of the defendants from this initial photo display.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.056" offset="1758331">Mr. Almengor identified a photograph of Mr. Vargas only.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.305" offset="1779333">Again his identification was not positive.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.506" offset="1796156">He stated that the pictures that he was looking at seemed to him to be outdated and he asked the prison authorities to see what they could do about getting some new pictures for him to view.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.188" offset="1838892">Mr. Allen saw the same group of pictures that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.719" offset="1852998">He was able to identify no one.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.859" offset="1861567">He too commented that he thought new pictures would be helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.951" offset="1881942">In a few days following this the prison authorities attempted to take new pictures of a number of inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.384" offset="1911722">Only those of the three defendants turned out.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.712" offset="1916946">These three pictures were placed in a different group of 15 pictures, which is People's Exhibit 24, which were shown to the witnesses on the 30th of October.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.880" offset="1965638">The identifying information on these pictures, the names and the dates the pictures were taken, that was covered at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.234" offset="1995105">At this point both Allen and Almengor identified all three of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.250" offset="2023108">At trial the two of them stated that they were now sure when they saw Mr. Vargas in person at trial that he was not one of the people who attacked the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.402" offset="2063754">They remained firm, however, in their identifications of the defendant and Mr. Gallegos.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.492" offset="2088100">I believe that the 9th Circuit's opinion is in error in several respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.600" offset="2116522">The first error is its statement of the standard for determining the admissibility of identification evidence in a case where pretrial photographic identification procedures have been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.188" offset="2174931">The 9th Circuit stated that the appropriate standard required a two-part approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.372" offset="2211607">First, a court should look to the necessity for use of photographic identification procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.978" offset="2234073">Here, since the defendant and his codefendants were state prison inmates, the court found that there was no necessity for the use of photographic identification procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.552" offset="2280362">From this lack of necessity it proceeded directly to a determination of whether there had been a likelihood of misidentification.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.689" offset="2316933">The lack of necessity was said to be an important factor weighing against the admissibility of their identification evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.779" offset="2349220">It is our position and our belief that this Court has never held that necessity or lack of necessity for use of a particular procedure is part of the constitutional standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.663" offset="2404809">Indeed, the Court has rejected attempts, most recently, in Manson v. Brathwaite, to have generalities such as this included in what is basically a fact-oriented balancing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.675" offset="2456845">The Court has, in Simmons v. United States, and again in U.S. v. Ash, declined the opportunity to formulate special rules in cases where pretrial photographic identification procedures have been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.590" offset="2524450">The Court has, instead, applied what we believe is a consistent standard of due process fairness in all cases involving the use of pretrial identification procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.005" offset="2582128">It has applied the same standard whether photographic identification procedures were used, whether a live lineup or showup was used, or whether there was a combination of these factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.266" offset="2631238">I believe that this Court's due process standard focuses on two things: first, the suggested nature of the particular pretrial confrontation involved in the case; and, second, the reliability of the identification evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.042" offset="2698321">We believe that the Court's consistent treatment of all these situations makes it clear that it believes that due process does not require that a particular procedure be used, or that the use of one procedure as opposed to another should be penalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.315" offset="2767389">Rather, I believe the Court's cases require only that the procedure which is actually used not be so unfair to deny a defendant due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.389" offset="2807722">We therefore ask the Court to reject the 9th Circuit's approach and to affirm the approach which has been adopted by the 5th Circuit and by the majority of the other courts which have considered the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.463" offset="2859967">And that approach, very briefly stated, is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.522" offset="2880238">First, if the defendant objects to the admission of identification evidence, a court should first ask itself whether the pretrial identification procedures actually used have been so impermissibly suggestive that they could give rise to a very substantial likelihood of mistaken identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.608" offset="2964561">The focus here is on the particular identification confrontation and the circumstances surrounding it.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.761" offset="2993191">The Court may consider, for example, any circumstances tending to suggest that the witness should identify a particular person or not identify a particular person.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.052" offset="3042301">It may consider the circumstances of the crime, the extent that they have a bearing on the question of suggestiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.798" offset="3081276">If and only if the Court should determine that the pretrial identification procedures used were so impermissibly suggestive that they could give rise to a very substantial likelihood of mistaken identification, does it become necessary to determine whether in fact it it is likely that they had this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.103" offset="3170510">In making this latter determination the focus is on the reliability of the identification evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.301" offset="3195379">It is at this point that the Court applies the five factors stated in Neil v. Biggers, and restated in Manson v. Brathwaite, and any other factors bearing on the question of whether the identification evidence is reliable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2860.858" offset="11585596">This is a fully litigated issue and you have a complete record on the eyewitness identification question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.967" offset="11605971">It seems to me that the dispute between the parties on the merits in this case is essentially whether the Court of Appeals ought to have been free to consider necessity, the lack of necessity, and particularly the failure to conduct a lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.754" offset="11685175">Now, it seems to me very clear that the court ought to have been free to do it, and that's precisely what the Court of Appeals did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.611" offset="11720597">The test that this Court has established in Manson and in Neil is totality of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.763" offset="11753198">A court looks to all of the circumstances and so long as it predicates its findings on reliability, so long as it looks to reliability, and so long as reliability is the bottom line, then I read this Court's opinions, especially in Manson and Neil, to conclude that any circumstance may be considered by a court so long as it goes to reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.474" offset="11840029">Now, here in this case you have a witness who is essentially saying, I cannot make an identification from photographs, I need to see a lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.173" offset="11874824">You also have no reason why a lineup could not have been conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.655" offset="11900737">Let's assume, at least, that there is a dispute between the parties on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.935" offset="11921844">But let's assume, for the moment, that there is no explanation, there is no valid explanation for why a lineup could not be conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.230" offset="11943056">And it seems to me very obvious, under those facts, that the failure to conduct a lineup is a factor going to reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.632" offset="11972626">We all know, and this Court has held, that lineups are more reliable than photographic identification where you have a witness saying, I cannot make an identification from a photograph, it's too old, the photographs are in black and white.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.547" offset="12040336">Where you have a witness who's saying that, and saying, I need to have a lineup, then it's perfectly proper for a court to consider the failure to conduct a lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.873" offset="12073668">And I think if you read the petitioner's briefs in this case, you see that there has been a subtle shift from the opening brief to the closing brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.666" offset="12120793">What petitioner had been arguing at the outset and what is essentially the position that, as I read the 5th Circuit cases, has been adopted in the 5th Circuit, is that you do not look to the conduct of the police in passing on suggestiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.081" offset="12186412">What you look to is the photo spread by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.111" offset="12198533">You don't look beyond the photo spread, and you look to the photo spread on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.470" offset="12215983">Well, that assumes that so long as you have a photo spread which is fair on its face, then you never get beyond it and you never get to the second step, which is reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.654" offset="12256734">And I think a few simple examples ought to demonstrate to the Court that that simply cannot be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.400" offset="12279722">Let's assume that you have a photo spread which is fair on its face, but that the police officer is saying to the witness, this is the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.256" offset="12307203">Look at photograph number three, don't you think that looks like him?</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.536" offset="12328309">Now, I think everybody would concede that in a circumstance such as that the conduct of the police in suggesting a particular identification to a witness was a factor that properly could be considered in passing on, (a) suggestiveness, and (b) reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.762" offset="12409185">And I think that's essentially what was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.105" offset="12426530">I think that you have peculiarity, a peculiar fact situation in this case where you have a witness saying, I cannot make an identification from a photograph, I need to see a lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.708" offset="12476998">I think that that's one factor to be considered along with many others that exist in this case that point to a suggestive identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.437" offset="12539901">You have, for example, the police officers telling the witnesses who made identifications... I think the record will bear out the conclusion that the initial identifications that were made by witness Almengor were positive identifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.572" offset="12600401">He identified someone by the name of "Bogus Pete" Nunez, as the perpetrator of the offense, and the guard said to him, no, no, it can't be Bogus Pete, Bogus Pete wasn't in the prison at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.641" offset="12672708">Now, it seems to me that if what the police are interested in is simply the identification that the witness presents to them rather than the one that they want to orchestrate, they will not point out wrong choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.558" offset="12736342">And I think this Court has indicated in several of its cases that it will not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.899" offset="12753687">Secondly, they removed all choices that they thought were wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.429" offset="12767898">The other witnesses, the other... Almengor also pointed out other people who simply magically disappeared from subsequent show-ups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.314" offset="12815441">Their photographs just never recurred again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.515" offset="12836234">I think the record also supports the fact that the three defendants who were ultimately identified were brought before the holding cell in a very suggestive way so that this also focused the attention of the witnesses on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.661" offset="12932783">These are all factors which I think the Court of Appeal considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.957" offset="12949919">I think if you read the Court of Appeal's opinion, it considered all proper factors, it applied an appropriate standard, and it came to the only conclusion that I think it could have come, which was that you had a very volatile, tense situation, there was an interest in identifying somebody, in getting somebody incarcerated for these... this offense, and they just picked out the three people that they thought were most conducive to being convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.394" offset="13095683">Now, I think if anything proves the necessity for a lineup in this case, nothing does it so much as the fact that after one of the witnesses said, I need to see a lineup, I cannot make identifications in photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.842" offset="13161511">They finally showed him the last photo spread, he points to the three defendants, they take him out, he has a chance encounter with the defendant Vargas, who is taking a shower, he sees him live, and he says, my God, I identified the wrong person, and he turns to the guard and he says, I picked out the wrong person, this is not the person who did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.582" offset="13252417">Now, this is a live, he sees him live.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.753" offset="13265165">This is the only opportunity that he had to see him live and he said, I picked out the wrong person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.142" offset="13278749">The guard said, in effect, tell it to the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.173" offset="13290869">And he goes to court, and here we are today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.749" offset="13309155">I think that is palpable proof of the fact that these witnesses indeed needed a lineup, that you could not have a reliable identification in this case without a lineup, and that the Court of Appeals properly considered that factor in reversing this conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3417.012" offset="13810184">The 9th Circuit doesn't so much take that on; it says, the fact that there was this knife attack going on, this violence, this excitement, that very likely had the effect of, if you will, taking the witness's attention away from the men in front of him so that very likely they did not have an opportunity to view the attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.627" offset="13912688">This particular finding seems to be a general purpose one made up by the 9th Circuit.</text>
