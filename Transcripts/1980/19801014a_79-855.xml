Flook, which was decided in the 1977 term, and because the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals' rejection of that interpretation of the Patent Act in favor of a different explanation of the result reached by the Court in Flook has put the Patent Office in an obviously difficult position with respect to the thousands of pending patent applications involving computer programming.</text>

            <text syncTime="567.599" offset="2402006">However, whether contested or conceded, the Board of Appeals, I think quite rightly, thought it was its duty to determine whether there is any novelty thing claimed other than in what must be assumed under Flook to be within the prior art.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.966" offset="2467417">And that determination was made in this case and the conclusion was that the only contribution, as the Board put it, the only novelty inhered in the program, the computer program, that was a part of these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.598" offset="2561980">And, as we detail in our briefs and our reply briefs, there was an examination here of the prior art cited by the respondent itself before the Patent Office, a patent that had been issued to Coulter and an application by Carre, in both of which all of the diagrams save the ones at the very end were reproduced by the respondent as part of their claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.005" offset="2707639">The Coulter patent, indeed, is an example of the kind of patent that has been issued on computer hardware.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.658" offset="2750271">Some of the briefs suggest that our position is that such patents can't be issued, but that in itself is an example of such patents that are valid and can be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.870" offset="2811084">And, in analyzing these in detail, it was seen that all that was left as a contribution was the program, although respondents contend otherwise before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.394" offset="2877226">I think this is adequately set forth in our brief and reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.487" offset="2893526">In light of those findings, there were three possible bases as we see the case, for distinguishing of Flook and for reaching a different result from Flook.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.995" offset="2959564">And all three of those are, in our view, unpersuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.307" offset="2976805">The first is that this application involved a machine claim rather than a process claim such as was involved in the Flook case.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.611" offset="3050052">The first thing I want to mention about that difference is a passage from an opinion by Judge Rich in the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.215" offset="3112432">It happens to be a dissenting opinion but it's not dissenting on this particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.321" offset="3132912">It's in a case called 545 F. 2d, and at page 160 he points out in his opinion, based on the experience of that Court and of the Patent Office:</text>
            <text syncTime="769.595" offset="3210026">"Given an invention which is in essence a new program for a general purpose digital computer, a competent patent draftsman can readily define the invention as either a process or a machine or both. "</text>
            <text syncTime="785.790" offset="3274810">"This has been demonstrated time and again by the computer program cases which have come to this Court. "</text>
            <text syncTime="793.569" offset="3305843">We have another similar quotation from the same judge in our brief, on page 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.425" offset="3353281">This is not, as we regard it, a difference of substance in the claim or a difference of inventive contribution, but basically a difference in the draftsmanship of the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.340" offset="3420991">And indeed the fact that the application is put as a machine claim rather than a process claim, if anything raises possible additional impediments to the granting of the application because of the cases we've collected on page 17 of our brief, in which this Court has consistently held that a claim describing the inherent operation of a known machine is not statutory subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.185" offset="3560380">Obviously, whether the machine was capable of executing the program that respondents have devised was predetermined by the design of the machine itself, and the inventor of that machine should hardly be excluded under the patent laws from uses of the machine which were inherent in the operation that he built into the machine, which is really what's involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.625" offset="3698098">As we further point out, there is also the problem that allowing this as a new machine claim would extend the life of the patent on the machine through a new machine claim that essentially just describes one of the inherent operations of the machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.832" offset="3802901">This is not a matter that's wholly irrelevant to what the respondents have... put into the case in this Court, because page 1 of respondents' brief starts off, in their statement under the heading, "What the invention is":</text>
            <text syncTime="936.528" offset="3877716">"The Respondents' invention is one of a series of inventions which collectively define an entirely new computer machine which is now being commercially marketed worldwide as the Honeywell Series 60, Level 64 computer. "</text>
            <text syncTime="953.099" offset="3943962">In essence they're saying that the life of the of the Coulter patent is extended by this additional machine patent if it were to be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.406" offset="4001223">And we have also addressed in our reply brief the possibility of a doctrine of transitory novelty where a particular selection put into a player piano or a particular letter or a memorandum inserted into a word processor that hasn't been in the word processor before... you know, those machines that are replacing typewriters in offices... would transform the machine for the moment into a new machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.936" offset="4171332">This has never been a doctrine recognized under the patent law and would have the same drawbacks, the same inconsistencies of established law as I have described.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.322" offset="4220860">A second possible basis for distinguishing Flook, equally unpersuasive in our view, is that the claim here involves firmware, so-called, rather than software.</text>

            <text syncTime="1235.847" offset="5074960">It's really a more common use than solving mathematical problems of the kind that was involved in Flook.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.531" offset="5109755">The examples given by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals are typical of that, reproducing a page of the Milwaukee phone book or a court opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.432" offset="5161373">This is data processing, and in a sense a computer is a data structure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1269.615" offset="5210065">Now, the fact that the claims here involve firmware rather than software seem to us of no legal significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.361" offset="5265027">The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals itself said that firmware may be likened to software.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.655" offset="5290209">All that is really involved here is a microprogram that fits into the control unit rather than the kind of program that fits into the main memory storage, so that then the microprogram, like an ordinary program, consists of a series of sequential steps to be carried out through the ordinary mathematical functioning of the digital computer; but using them in a microprogram in the control unit, that enables the programmer to have a so-called macroprogram in the main memory and he can, by throwing that one switch, or giving that one instruction, that will set off the series of sequential steps that have been put into the control unit in the microprogram.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.648" offset="5502219">That's the only difference and it doesn't seem to us or to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals to be a difference of legal significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.286" offset="5540775">Then the third possible basis for distinguishing Flook and the one that the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals has in fact been relying on in the post-Flook cases is an attempt to limit the holding in Flook to computer programs designed to solve mathematical problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.790" offset="5642757">Our submission is that this is basically an illusory distinction and indeed one that doesn't fit in with the reasoning of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals itself, in its own cases, because a digital computer is designed solely to perform mathematical computations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.373" offset="5749128">Any program that makes use of it is necessarily mathematical in nature, regardless of whether it's designed ultimately to find the solution to a mathematical problem or for the more common purpose of data processing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.850" offset="5823002">And indeed, the skills and contribution required of the deviser of the program does not depend on whether the program is designed to solve a mathematical problem or to do the data processing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.875" offset="5887054">The examples given by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in this case, reproducing a page of the Milwaukee telephone directory or a particular court opinion, seem to us examples that require less of a contribution, less of an inventive contribution from a programmer than was involved in Flook, where, after all, a new formula was devised to calculate the alarm limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.173" offset="6032295">Whether the particular inventive contribution varies, depending on the nature of the data processing to be done or the nature of the mathematical problem to be solved--</text>

            <text syncTime="1520.779" offset="6214734">I just want to briefly inform the Court of the legislative developments in this field, currently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.823" offset="6254859">On page 24 of our brief we refer to a bill that was introduced last March by Representative Kastenmeier, a bill entitled,</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.350" offset="6305014">"The Computer Software Copyright Act of 1980. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.536" offset="6321732">That bill since that time has been favorably reported by both the House Committee on Government Operations and the House Judiciary Committee, but has not yet gone to the House floor, although it is anticipated that there will be floor action with respect to it during the session right after the elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.900" offset="6427162">There has not yet been activity in the Senate, but the significant thing, as we see it, is that the congressional activity is focusing on copyright protection rather than patent protection, which would protect the deviser of computer programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.204" offset="6508455">Arguably, this protection already exists under the present copyright law and this would just be a clarification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.545" offset="6529771">But it would afford protection to the deviser of programs against plagiarism, against the copying of the fruits of his labors, but still would not preclude others, would not exclude them from the inherent uses of the machine if they through their own labors want to devise a program to process similar data in a similar way... for instance, reproducing the Milwaukee telephone directory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.035" offset="6643770">There may be a basis for a congressional judgment if that is a more appropriate form of protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="2962.015" offset="11979645">In the joint appendix in this case, on pages 99 through 120, are reproduced the diagrams that accompany the application, and which I think can quickly be referred to to show what it was that was being claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.285" offset="12072746">The diagrams on pages 99 through 119 were all reproductions of those in the prior art and in the Coulter patent and Carre application, the Coulter patent having been assigned to Honeywell, which is also the assignee of this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.604" offset="12173996">The ones claimed to be novel, the ones added, are those on page 120.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.005" offset="12211613">The ones up through page 119 are the same hardware, the same arrangement of hardware.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.519" offset="12237631">The ones on 120 are Figures 15a, 15b, and 15c.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.314" offset="12264903">On page 2 of our reply brief, we discussed these briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.951" offset="12287368">Respondents told the Patent Office that Figure 15a illustrated the switch system base instruction whose</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.041" offset="12327805">"operation code is similar to the operation code of any instruction. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.507" offset="12349644">In other words, it's really a conventional macroprogram mechanism by which to activate the microprogram in the control unit that is illustrated in Figures 15b and 15c.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.531" offset="12429683">Those are flow charts which the respondent stated disclosed the microprogram, or can be translated into the microprogram.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.104" offset="12475972">That is the basis for the Board's finding that the claim of novelty inhered in a microprogram, and that everything else was conventional in the art.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.661" offset="12534277">Now, obviously, process claims and machine claims stand on equal footing under Section 101.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.923" offset="12571267">The mere fact that a claim is phrased as one or the other cannot be the end of inquiry under Flook, and I'll elaborate further on the meaning of Flook in the next case.</text>
