            <text syncTime="321.958" offset="1438638">Congress has expressly authorized the Secretary to define the term "available income" for purposes of the Medicaid statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.130" offset="1471344">And this Court's decision in Batterton v. Francis makes it plain that an agency's exercise of such express statutory authority may only be set aside if it is inconsistent with the statute on which it is based, arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.525" offset="1544904">Disagreement with the judgment necessarily implicit in such an exercise of authority is insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.429" offset="1568519">The Court of Appeals first agreed with the Secretary that the Congress' use of the term "available income" was not intended to preclude consideration of the income of the applicant's spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.589" offset="1625257">Although there is nothing in the statute or the legislative history that distinguishes between spouses who are living together and those who are separated by institutionalization, the Court of Appeals inferred from the legislative history, a congressional intention to create such a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.984" offset="1698818">The basis for this inference was a statement in the legislative history indicating that the states would be precluded from assuming the availability of the income of an absent father, or on the basis of a court support order.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.910" offset="1754511">In the view of the Court of Appeals, this statement suggested a general intention to treat spouses living together different from those who are separated by institutionalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.451" offset="1800695">The statement provides only the most tenuous support for the Court's inference, and it is plainly insufficient to support invalidation of the Secretary's regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.174" offset="1843536">As the Court of Appeals acknowledged, Congress has stated that it is the primary responsibility of the Secretary and not the courts, to determine whether and to what extent the income of the Medicaid applicant's spouse will be considered for the purposes of determining Medicaid eligibility and the amount of assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.822" offset="1934129">Without substantially more support than that relied on by the Court of Appeals in this case, the Secretary's exercise of that responsibility should be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.913" offset="1978537">The Secretary has consistently interpreted the term "available income" to include the income of the applicant's spouse whether they live together or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.971" offset="2030782">Both the language and the legislative history or the statute support the Secretary's interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.243" offset="2067876">In the provision of the Medicaid Act dealing exclusively with state eligibility criteria, Congress provided that only available income should be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.153" offset="2119494">In this same provision, Congress also stated that the states could consider the financial responsibility of the applicant's spouse for the purpose of making Medicaid determinations and for the purpose of determining the amount of assistance an applicant might be entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.966" offset="2202668">In the legislative history, Congress expressly stated its view that spouses should be expected to support each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.039" offset="2239030">Congress did not distinguish between spouses living together and those who are separated by institutionalization, or for some other reason, nor was the Secretary required to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.228" offset="2279781">Respondent contends that the states may only consider the income of the applicant's spouse by filing an independent lawsuit under generally applicable civil or criminal support statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.323" offset="2344147">This Court should reject that interpretation of the statute for at least three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.060" offset="2367135">First, it is inconsistent with the language of the statute which provides that the states may consider the income of an applicant's spouse for the purpose of determining Medicaid eligibility and for the purpose of determining the amount of assistance an applicant may be entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.938" offset="2438606">This is an initial step.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.124" offset="2447383">Respondent has never attempted... or, never explained how filing an independent lawsuit under a generally applicable civil or criminal statute can be said to be considering the income of the applicant's spouse for the purpose of making Medicaid determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.255" offset="2543827">Second, this interpretation of the statute would require the filing of thousands of tiny lawsuits, sometimes perhaps several against the same individual, since the payments are made by the state monthly or quarterly and the spouse... and, at the same time the state would be continuing to pay benefits to an individual who may or may not be eligible for benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.940" offset="2654586">And finally, if Congress intended to create such a distinction or such an administrative scheme which would have required the states to spend a great deal of money filing all of these lawsuits, trying to recover money that they shouldn't have had to pay out in the first place, one would expect that something in the legislative history would have been said about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.655" offset="2749463">There is absolutely no support in the legislative history suggesting that Congress intended for the states to consider the income of the applicant's spouse for the purpose of determining Medicaid eligibility by filing an independent lawsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="826.137" offset="3455396">The Respondent contends that the term "available income" includes the income of the applicant's spouse only if it is actually contributed in some sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.628" offset="3505342">Congress however, used the term "available income" and not contributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.148" offset="3531464">Furthermore, Congress expressly authorized the states to consider the income of the applicant's spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.086" offset="3555184">In further answer to your question, Mr. Justice Stevens, it might be said that Congress clearly did not intend the term "available" to be interpreted to exclude the income of the applicant's spouse since there would have been no need for the further provision that the states could consider the income of the applicant's spouse that was prohibited in the preceding section.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.769" offset="3657897">In addition to authorizing the states to consider the income of the applicant's spouse, Congress delegated responsibility to the Secretary for giving further content to that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.846" offset="3718188">The Secretary has never construed the term to exclude the income of the applicant's spouse simply because the spouse refused to turn it over to the applicant; nothing in the statute or the legislative history even suggests that interpretation of the language and there's certainly nothing that requires the Secretary to adopt that construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.676" offset="3801570">Absent compelling evidence that the Secretary has grossly misconceived Congress' intent, this Court should decline Respondent's invitation to disregard the interpretation of the agency Congress has expressly authorized to define the statutory term.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.273" offset="3887984">The last part of our brief is devoted to explaining the analysis that led to the particular regulations in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.396" offset="3924450">And we recognized, as Respondents point out, the complexity of that analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.116" offset="3947334">And I would like to try briefly to explain what the analysis was that led to the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.023" offset="3990906">Following the enactment of the Supplemental Security Income program for the aged, blind and disabled in 1972, the Secretary published regulations reflecting the impact of this new legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.050" offset="4055063">All participating states were required to consider the income of a Medicaid applicant's spouse to the extent that it would be considered in determining SSI eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.610" offset="4113264">The states that exercised the 209(b) option were permitted to consider the income of the applicant's spouse to the extent that they did so in 1972 even if it would not be considered in determining SSI eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.954" offset="4186720">And thus, the Secretary's regulations established a kind of maximum and minimum extent to which states may consider the income of an applicant's spouse for purposes of determining Medicaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.931" offset="4242622">The Secretary's regulations are based on the very careful analysis of two exceedingly complex social welfare statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.054" offset="4279089">They are not based on the notion that Congress' reasons for adopting the particular SSI provisions are directly applicable in the Medicaid context, nor did the Secretary assume that Congress intended in some sense to prescribe rules for determining what income is available for purposes of the Medicaid program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.919" offset="4370517">Rather, as I said, the regulations are derived from an analysis of the interlocking provisions of the Medicaid and SSI statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.708" offset="4409701">These regulations cannot reasonably be characterized as arbitrary or capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.345" offset="4432271">Section 1902(a)(10) of the Medicaid statute establishes the basic scope of the Medicaid program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.823" offset="4494129">More important for present purposes, that provision establishes or provides the key to understanding the analysis that led to the regulations challenged here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.479" offset="4536761">Because of the relationship between the two statutes the Secretary requires the states to consider the income to the extent that it would be considered in determining SSI eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.556" offset="4593081">Because of the purpose of the 209(b) option, the Secretary permits the states to consider the income of an applicant's spouse to the extent they did so in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.797" offset="4642086">Under the first provision of Section 1902(a)(10), all states, all participating states, are required to provide Medicaid benefits to every aged, blind, disabled individual receiving benefits under the SSI program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.662" offset="4737486">Now putting to one side for the moment the 209(b) option, it is clear that the Secretary could not permit any state to consider the income of an applicant's spouse if it would not be considered in determining SSI eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.172" offset="4795582">Otherwise, individuals who were receiving SSI benefits could be found ineligible for Medicaid contrary to the very clear command of Section 1902(a)(10)(A) that all SSI recipients be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.966" offset="4866739">Now, on the other hand, aged, blind or disabled individuals who are ineligible for SSI benefits are also ineligible for Medicaid, unless the state... unless they meet the requirements of one of the very carefully circumscribed optional group provisions and the state has decided to provide Medicaid benefits to that particular group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.218" offset="4975722">Now again putting aside for the moment the 209(b) option, it follows that the Secretary cannot... it follows that the states must consider the income of all applicants and their spouses to the extent that it would be considered under the SSI statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.881" offset="5058374">Otherwise, even if an individual is ineligible for SSI benefits he could be found eligible for Medicaid, even if the state doesn't provide benefits to any of the optional coverage groups; a result that is manifestly contrary to the terms of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.778" offset="5137995">The Secretary obviously cannot redetermine the eligibility of every person covered every state plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.566" offset="5177074">There are certain optional coverage provisions and it is unnecessary to describe them in detail here... it should be emphasized however, that each of them is subject to its own set of very carefully drawn limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.491" offset="5228797">Because of the inequity of permitting the states to use one method for determining the, for calculating the income of the optional coverage groups, and another method for calculating the income of the mandatory coverage groups, the Secretary has required the states to use the same method for calculating the income of both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.407" offset="5320434">Neither the Court of Appeals nor Respondent challenges that aspect of the Secretary's regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.210" offset="5347706">Thus, unless the 209(b) option requires a different kind of analysis, the relationship between the Medicaid and SSI statutes not only supports the reasonableness of the Secretary's regulations but virtually compels those regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.824" offset="5430148">The language, the legislative history and the purpose of the 209(b) option all support the Secretary's conclusion that the provision does not require a different analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.284" offset="5488036">By its terms, the provision simply gives the states an option to deny Medicaid coverage to those individuals the states would otherwise be required to cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.791" offset="5534011">As I pointed out however, the only individuals the state is required to cover are SSI recipients, under Section 1902(a)(10)(A).</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.699" offset="5581659">The primary effect of the 209(b) option then is simply to give the states a partial exemption from the otherwise applicable requirements of that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.409" offset="5632441">The legislative history makes virtually indisputable what seems apparent from the terms of the provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.729" offset="5657727">In explaining the purpose and intent of the provision, both the Senate Committee and the House Committee pointed out that the provision was simply intended to allow the states to exclude from mandatory Medicaid coverage there individuals it would not have been required to cover before the SSI program was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.011" offset="5750932">The states were to be permitted to exclude from coverage those individuals who were newly eligible, that is, those who became eligible for mandatory Medicaid coverage because the scope of coverage under the SSI statute was broader than that of the old Categorical Assistance Programs that it replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.543" offset="5845077">With one arguable exception, 209(b) states like SSI states are only entitled to federal financial assistance for providing Medicaid benefits to an individual who is ineligible for SSI if the state provides benefits pursuant to one of the optional provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.657" offset="5937446">Thus, all states must consider the income of an applicant's spouse at least to the extent that it would be considered in determining SSI eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.883" offset="5986348">Otherwise, the Secretary would be obliged to redetermine the eligibility of every person covered under every state plan in order... or before he could determine whether the state federal financial assistance, an impossible administrative burden and surely not one Congress intended to impose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1766.912" offset="7218491">This appears on page 12(a) of the government's petition for a writ of certiorari:</text>

            <text syncTime="3243.270" offset="13123941">I'd also say that a person who has $5000 a month income, the spouse probably would not be eligible for Medicaid, if that's the person making the contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.809" offset="13158109">If the spouse with $5000... if that person simply refuses to make the contribution, then the state has the right to go into state court and obtain a necessary contribution, and a reasonable contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.935" offset="13222579">I'd like to point but also, that this Court in similar cases involving the AFDC program has apparently shown some disenchantment with exactly the procedure used here, and in Van Lare v. Hurley and Lewis v. Martin, this Court emphasized that states cannot include income available to an applicant for AFDC which is not in fact available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.604" offset="13341280">One of those cases, the Court stated that the bread can only be counted when it is actually set on the table.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.442" offset="13368656">There's another important aspect of those two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.494" offset="13380882">In Van Lare, the Court noted that deeming in that context, directed against a lodger living in the house, who might not be contributing to the support of the applicant child, that the state could not move against the lodger by essentially holding that child blackmail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.190" offset="13455592">And that is exactly what deeming in this context amounts to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.009" offset="13474922">The state is using the guilt or whatever of the non institutionalized spouse... about the institutionalized spouse, in order to force a support payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.650" offset="13521420">And that support payment, we submit, can only be obtained through the regular state judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.721" offset="13545766">The state cannot say to the non institutionalized spouse, well, you can either contribute the $150 a month, or ultimately your spouse is going to be evicted from the nursing home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.328" offset="13584114">The purpose of the Medicaid program was to guarantee that individuals who needed necessary health care and did not have sufficient income regardless of the reason why they didn't have sufficient income, would obtain needed health care.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.954" offset="13650674">In this instance, that health care is ultimately going to be denied because the state is trying to force the other spouse to cooperate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3448.483" offset="13944813">But I'd like to say that the 209(b) options essentially gives the states the right to choose whatever Medicaid rules they want, with only one proviso... that they cannot be any more restrictive than those in effect in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.012" offset="14010850">It was an effort to give the states some flexibility; they could choose to go with SSI, as about two thirds of the states have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.599" offset="14037286">That gives the states much more administrative convenience because the Social Security Administration will then determine Medicaid eligibility for them and they don't have to go through that process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.804" offset="14074067">If the states want to use more restrictive rules, they can by choosing a 209(b) option.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.439" offset="14092562">They then have the administrative burdens which comes with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.741" offset="14105832">At the same time, however, they are required to use the spend down mechanism, which is probably the most liberal element that Congress has included in the Medicaid statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.932" offset="14146583">And that allows individuals whose incomes might be slightly over the cash assistance levels to spend down and obtain eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.019" offset="14174899">The 209(b) option was a choice that Congress gave the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="3590.034" offset="14510939">The first point that I want to make in my three minutes is that Respondent's emphasis, one, the levels with the hypotheticals of Mrs. Ford or Mr. Ford, I guess, is inappropriate in this case because the level of benefits or the levels... or the amount of the contribution the state requires the spouse to make is not at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.906" offset="14642491">The Court of Appeals held that the Secretary's regulations were invalid for failure to distinguish between spouses living together and those who were separated by institutionalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.215" offset="14695677">The level, the amount of the contribution is not at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.534" offset="14708947">The Secretary's regulations did not prescribe the amount of the contribution, and the Court of Appeals didn't invalidate the regulations because of the amount of the contribution asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.725" offset="14753773">Now, in response, my own hypothetical might be useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.213" offset="14775716">Respondent's position is that it doesn't matter how much money the spouse has, as long as he refuses to contribute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.985" offset="14814795">Now, if a spouse has $100,000 of income, Mr. Deford says most of these people don't have $100,000 of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.672" offset="14841544">But as he pointed out, in response to the Chief Justice's question, it wouldn't make any difference if he did, as long as he refuses to contribute it, the applicant is eligible for Medicaid and the state is obliged to pay out benefits while, or in the interim, while it tries to collect this money from the spouse who may or may not have money available for the state to attach, assuming of course, that the state has such a statute under which it could pursue the spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.444" offset="14968604">We are informed that there are some states who don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.912" offset="14982501">Now, it's conceivable that the states could adopt a statute that would allow them to do this, but it's not clear that all states do have those programs, those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.335" offset="15020222">The final point I'd like to make is that Respondent has suggested that the 209(b) option doesn't do what we say it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.061" offset="15083125">I'd like to just read briefly from the Senate Report describing that option.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.698" offset="15105695">"The 209(b) option gives states the option of covering under Medicaid, aged, blind and disabled persons made newly eligible for cash assistance as a result of the increases in payment levels to these persons provided under the bill, the SSI statute. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.975" offset="15166717">"No state would be required to furnish medical assistance to any individual receiving aid as a needy aged, blind or disabled adult, unless the state would be required or would have been required under its 1972 plan. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.069" offset="15235157">There's no other way to read that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.854" offset="15246233">My time is up.</text>
