            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="157885">We will turn to our first case and we'll hear arguments in United Mine Workers v. the Labor Board and the consolidated case.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.141" offset="210443">Mr. Dalton, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Harlon L. Dalton</label>
            <text syncTime="19.295" offset="234998">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="23.615" offset="252344">This case comes to the Court on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.685" offset="276585">Two petitions were filed, one by the United Mine Workers and a second on behalf of the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.923" offset="305529">I should add that the Department of Labor, which administers ERISA, is not a party in this proceeding but concurs in the views presented by the Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.314" offset="347116">The question presented in both cases is whether a management-appointed trustee of a jointly administered Taft-Hartley trust fund is a collective bargaining agent within the meaning of Section 8(b)(1)(B) of the National Labor Relations Act, which forbids unions from coercing employers in the selection of their collective bargaining representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.910" offset="437500">In practical terms, at issue in this case is whether a union may strike as part of its effort to induce an employer to contribute to a multiemployer, as distinct from a single employer, pension, or welfare fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.272" offset="502910">Now, although the dealings between Amax Coal Company and the union in this case were rather complex, the facts that relate to the sole issue that's before this Court are rather straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.228" offset="546796">Amax Coal Company mines coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.014" offset="557872">It does so primarily in the midwest and in deep shaft bituminous mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.067" offset="578143">It bargains with the UMW through the Bituminous Coal Operators Association with respect to its midwest operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.506" offset="611893">Now, in 1972, Amax Coal Company opened its first surface strip mine in Gillette, Wyoming, called the Belle Ayr mine, and that's the subject of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.231" offset="654734">Amax did not negotiate through the BCOA in connection with the Belle Ayr mine but instead entered into a separate agreement with the mine workers that was patterned on the BCOA contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.372" offset="711367">And pursuant to that independently negotiated contract Amax contributed to the union's national multiemployer pension and welfare funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.762" offset="748879">In January of 1975, at the expiration of that Belle Ayr contract and the expiration of several other western surface mine contracts, the union struck the Belle Ayr mine and the mines of other western coal operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.789" offset="817007">The following month, in February, the union and Amax began negotiations over the Belle Ayr mine but they reached an impasse in March and in mid-March... I think, March 17... Amax resumed operations at the mine under its last contract proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.668" offset="884507">Over the course of the next year the parties engaged in sporadic negotiations but no agreement was ever reached between them.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="188.637" stopTime="202.397">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="188.637" offset="912406">Mr. Dalton, does the Government concede that if the person in question here was a collective bargaining agent rather than a trustee, there was coercion on the part of the union?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harlon_l_dalton" startTime="202.397" stopTime="298.145">
            <label>Mr. Harlon L. Dalton</label>
            <text syncTime="202.397" offset="967472">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.264" offset="970920">Now, among the sticking points which led to the impasse was... and there were several, but there's only one that's before this Court today... was Amax's refusal to continue to contribute to the multiemployer pension and trust funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.709" offset="1040719">Those funds were set up pursuant to Section 302(c)(5) of the Labor Management Relations Act, the Taft-Hartley Act, and provide for comprehensive health and retirement benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.433" offset="1087531">Those funds are administered pursuant to that section by three trustees, one appointed by the union, one appointed by management, and the third trustee to be appointed by the other two.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.741" offset="1132775">At the time the negotiations between Amax and the union began over the Belle Ayr mine, the trustees were already appointed, the trust funds were set up, and the trustees were engaged in the active administration of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.318" offset="1191080">Now, while acknowledging that the union's trust fund proposals were mandatory subjects of collective bargaining, Amax took the position that the management-appointed trustees were collective bargaining representatives and that therefore the union's insistence to impasse, the union's striking in an effort to induce the company to contribute to those trust funds constituted a violation of Section 8(b)(1)(B).</text>
            <text syncTime="283.718" offset="1292749">And that's because the trustees were already selected at the time negotiations took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.139" offset="1318349">Amax filed an unfair labor charge with reference to this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.543" offset="1339978">They filed other charges but they are not before the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="365.668" offset="1620533">A two-judge panel of the court of appeals reached the opposite conclusion and pro tanto refused to enforce the Board's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.258" offset="1650835">In a nutshell, we submit that Congress did not intend for Taft-Hartley trustees to function as agents for either unions or employees while engaged in the administration of a trust; that trustees cannot do so without violating duties imposed upon them both by the common law and by ERISA: and that Taft-Hartley trustees do not in practice engage in collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.206" offset="1746652">Now, these arguments are laid out in our briefs, and I don't intend to elaborate on them here unless, of course, the Court wishes otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.627" offset="1780298">Instead I propose to address my remaining time to three considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.264" offset="1798897">One, the meaning of the term 302(c)(5).</text>
            <text syncTime="416.251" offset="1822825">Second, the equal representation provision of that section, what it means, what it's designed to accomplish, and how.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.940" offset="1853545">And third, some of the legal and institutional consequences of the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.927" offset="1877578">If all goes according to plan, my colleague of this side of the podium will address the impact of the decision below on multiemployer funds, and particularly on the funds at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.216" offset="1918747">I note at the outset that the term "representative" is not a term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.104" offset="1942257">It has no fixed meaning within the National Labor Relations Act or the Labor Management Relations Act and as this Court unanimously observed in United States v. Ryan, one Justice not participating, the terms "representative" and "collective bargaining representative" are not synonymous.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.065" offset="2006101">Amax argues that representative refers to persons who advance the interests of the parties that appoint them.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.069" offset="2034104">That construction however, as we demonstrate in our brief, is flatly inconsistent with Section 302's requirement that contributions be held in trust and that they be held in trust for the sole and exclusive benefit of trust beneficiaries.</text>

            <text syncTime="487.781" offset="2108918">Let's assume that, of course, a trustee represents no one except the interests of the trust.</text>

            <text syncTime="499.089" offset="2154163">But in a sense, does not... is not each of the trustees, one appointed by the union and one by the employer, a representative in a limited sense?</text>

          <turn speaker="harlon_l_dalton" startTime="510.896" stopTime="837.508">
            <label>Mr. Harlon L. Dalton</label>
            <text syncTime="510.896" offset="2201392">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but it's our position that they represent those parties, that the limitations of that representation are such that in any instance in which the interests of the parties to the collective bargaining agreement might possibly conflict with the interests of the beneficiaries, then the former must recede, and therefore it's inappropriate to consider them as collective bargaining representatives because the latter owe an undivided duty of loyalty to the parties that they represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.434" offset="2331586">It's our position, it's the common law, that trustees must eschew the interests of third parties, that they owe a sole primary exclusive obligation to trust beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.193" offset="2386652">That's also... ERISA has codified the common law and has essentially made those principles matters of federal statute, and therefore the most that can be said of the term representative as used in this Section 302(c)(5) is that it means, in effect, designee; refers to the fact that trustees are appointed by unions and employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.743" offset="2488843">So the next question is, to what end?</text>
            <text syncTime="584.677" offset="2496576">What is the purpose of the appointment of trustees by employers?</text>
            <text syncTime="588.748" offset="2512876">And in particular, what is the purpose of the equal participation rule, that for every trustee appointed by a union there must be a trustee appointed by an employer?</text>
            <text syncTime="599.370" offset="2555299">Now, it is common ground that this equal participation rule was one of a set of strictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.893" offset="2593438">The requirement that contributions be made into a formal trust is another, set up by Taft-Hartley to deter unions and union officials from misusing and misappropriating pension and welfare funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.820" offset="2653101">However, there's a serious division among the parties with respect to how that's to be achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.789" offset="2672954">It's our position that by their mere presence employer-appointed trustees serve to check potential pension abuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.645" offset="2704406">Furthermore, by participating in the actual workings, administration of the trust, trustees are in a position to discover and ferret out abuses and to take whatever steps are appropriate, including the commencing of lawsuits for breach of fiduciary responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.976" offset="2785699">Thirdly, because they are equal in number to the union-appointed trustees, the management trustees are in the position to block any efforts by their colleagues to advance the union's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.950" offset="2833660">None of these steps requires the slightest deviation from the exclusive obligation, exclusive duty of loyalty that trustees, management-appointed and union-appointed alike, owe to the beneficiaries of the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.210" offset="2890711">In marked contrast, the 3rd Circuit conception of how this watchdog provision is to operate is premised on the trustees' exhibiting at best divided loyalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.666" offset="2936478">The court of appeals stated that the trustees of a Taft-Hartley trust are "expected to advance the interests" of the appointed parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.040" offset="2973989">The court took the position that this advancing of private party interest or third-party interest was</text>
            <text syncTime="712.527" offset="3007949">"essential to the operation of Section 302(c)(5). "</text>
            <text syncTime="715.895" offset="3021428">and that the clash of party interests creates</text>
            <text syncTime="718.212" offset="3030727">"a distilling process which would provide safeguards against trust fund corruption. "</text>
            <text syncTime="722.566" offset="3048073">Now, whether or not this approach would root out corruption, we submit that it would have the inevitable collateral consequence of undermining orderly administration of trust and of fostering pursuits and interests that are alien to, or in any event, not congruent with the interest of trust beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.927" offset="3121529">This ongoing collective bargaining within the administration of the trust, as the court of appeals termed it, would lead to frequent stalemates, broken either by resort to arbitrators, compulsory arbitration, which I might notice are contrary to the way we normally think of collective bargaining, or impasses broken by horse trading in which concessions on trust issues might well be exchanged for concessions on non-trust issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.464" offset="3239707">Now, that compromise or subordination of the interest of trust beneficiaries is but one of the consequences of the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.587" offset="3280145">In addition, the introduction of collective bargaining considerations into the day-to-day administration of trust would have the effect of injecting the National Labor Relations Board into the routine matters of trust administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.549" offset="3352034">Whenever a disappointed party, be it a beneficiary of the trust or a trustee, concluded that one of the trustees had failed to engage in good faith collective bargaining, then that person would be entitled to file with the National Labor Relations Board an unfair labor practices charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.312" offset="3443044">And so, contrary to the scheme that was set up by Congress in which Section 302 of Taft-Hartley is reserved to the courts, the National Labor Relations Board would assume jurisdiction over the administration of trust funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1029.399" offset="4275410">And I take it, under your hypothetical, that if the trustees were... to accept the trustees are empowered to set royalty rates for salvage coal, any disputes would be resolved by compulsory arbitration, and that's a different mechanism, at least, than this typical collective bargaining.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harrison Combs</label>
            <text syncTime="1188.102" offset="4910290">Mr. Chief Justice; may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.137" offset="4922411">It is our position that the 3rd Circuit's decision holding that a management-appointed trustee is a collective bargaining representative jeopardizes collective bargaining relationship between the employer and employee in the coal industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.902" offset="5013421">And further, that if this is upheld, that it could lead to the extinction of multitrust funds in the coal industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.727" offset="5064726">I think it's just a bit ironic that this situation grew out of a strike in the coal industry in 1947 in which John L. Lewis was demanding, among other things, that the operators contribute to the union certain amounts based upon the royalty of coal produced for the purpose of health and retirement funds to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.115" offset="5194293">The Congress, the sponsors of 302(c), stated that there was a danger that if these contributions were paid to the union, to John Lewis, at that time, as they were saying, that they could be diverted, and that they could lead to war chests on the part of the union for purposes other than payment to beneficiaries and participants in these funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.737" offset="5316755">Therefore, the Congress in enacting 302(c) insulated these contributions from the control of the union by the method of providing that, in the first place, under the contract, that the funds would have to be the subject of a written agreement in the contract on which they were going to pay, and for what purposes they were going to be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.339" offset="5439217">The Congress further specified in 302(c) the benefits that could be paid from these funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.612" offset="5472236">It provided an equal balance of the trustees to be administered by the employer, the operator, and the union, by having a representative on the board of trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.554" offset="5536079">This has been in effect for the past 31 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.893" offset="5565441">To my knowledge it has not been challenged on this basis that the 3rd Circuit has adopted in this case by any court in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.916" offset="5609536">The Labor Board's opinion and the opinion of the Secretary of Labor and the opinion of the Solicitor on behalf of the National Labor Relations Board in my opinion is very correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.746" offset="5680798">To my mind, if the trustee is a bargaining representative of the appointing employer or union, that would lead to the administration of these funds by the National Labor Relations Board to unfair labor practices, which I think has been in one court, at least, in the District of Columbia, that a claimant for benefits under the fund took the position that the union had not fairly represented him as a trustee of the fund and therefore that he was wrongfully denied a pension that he should have been delivered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.025" offset="5861983">That case is cited in our brief in Miniard v. Lewis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.060" offset="5878074">The court rejected that argument and he said, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.297" offset="5895002">The court said, no, that these trustees had the fiduciary obligation to represent the beneficiaries and the participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.551" offset="5928021">And that was a sole obligation on their part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.855" offset="5945261">And I might point out to this Court that the argument between the beneficiary or the claimant, was between the trustees and not between an employer, as would be the case of adjusting a grievance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1543.352" offset="6331247">That would be answered by the third trustee as provided for in Section 302(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.756" offset="6356847">The two trustees, appointed by the employer and the union, have the right to select the third trustee, and the third trustee, that's a balancing under the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.266" offset="6414943">So that is my point, that under ERISA, which is encouraging multibargaining... there's a preamble in that... and the common law of trust administration, that these trustees, even in the salvage coal that Mr. Justice Stevens asked about, that that is an administrative problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.814" offset="6513059">It's refuse, it's a slate dump, and the trustees are authorized because it's just a question of determining how much coal, related to regular coal mining, may be in that slate dump.</text>

            <text syncTime="1740.529" offset="7119936">Now, I might point out this, that this multiemployer fund, the BCOA had about 160 companies at this time, we have over 2,000 independent companies that bargain to go into that, and we are constantly having them coming in and going out in this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.379" offset="7211364">And to set up a forum that would be total at the beginning of the contract, it just wouldn't be practical.</text>

            <text syncTime="1849.484" offset="7555763">This case and the section of the statute, Section 8(b)(1)(B) has been before this court before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.006" offset="7593901">This particular case involves several key concepts in the whole system of our free collective bargaining system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.278" offset="7630995">But one of the first ones is... which is contained in Section 9(a) of the Act... and it's emphasized, of course, in the Pittsburgh Plate Glass decision, that the purpose of the Act is to assure to employees the fullest freedom of the exercise of their rights to collective bargaining, unit by unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.823" offset="7701108">Belle Ayr mine is a separate unit, always has been a separate unit, never been part of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.613" offset="7736321">Another key concept in our free collective bargaining system is that the parties' representatives will be free, that they'll be dependent, that one party cannot be compelled to have accepted or forced on him a representative whose interests he feels are adverse or for whom they cannot act in even a fair way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.176" offset="7822525">There are interplay of many other concepts in the labor-management area that enter into this case, the duty of fair representation, we're talking about fiduciary duties.</text>

            <text syncTime="2037.851" offset="8309238">Well, no, because the Act dictates and guarantees to the parties unit-by-unit bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.607" offset="8340272">There is no... and it contravenes the requirements of the Act and the whole policies of collective bargaining for one unit to be able to force on another unit a representative or participation in a multiemployer trust that is basically the product of multiemployer bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.253" offset="8418848">In the particular case involved with Belle Ayr, Belle Ayr was contesting, that unit was resisting an effort to be forced into another bargaining unit for whatever, for lack of a better description was entitled, the Peabody Group, which was another separate multiemployer bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.614" offset="8488334">That strike commenced at Belle Ayr.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.649" offset="8496380">The Board found... this is undisputed in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.184" offset="8506620">It's not an issue before you, but it is a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.001" offset="8513829">Since the other parties have gone into some of the preliminary facts, I suppose there's no harm in shedding light on this part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.922" offset="8537549">The major issue in that strike that commenced was the strike by the union, the United Mine Workers, to compel Amax to participate in the Peabody Group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.896" offset="8577464">Now the reason that Amax did not participate in the Peabody Group, multiemployer bargaining, was because the Peabody Group would not listen, was not willing to entertain an alternative pension proposal, which Amax knew would be cheaper for itself, half the cost, essentially, of what the Mine Workers' plan was, better benefits, and with the same or better affordability; on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.380" offset="8683312">And that was one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.397" offset="8687387">There were other areas where the bargaining group was adverse, or at loggerheads, or adverse to the interests of Amax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.301" offset="8715077">And incidentally, that's a key point in bargaining, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.903" offset="8725421">I think that what the Government and what the union have totally ignored here, and it's not brought on the record, is that bargaining is a matter of compromise, that the process of collective bargaining as we see it is not black and white.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.845" offset="8785189">When the parties... negotiation is defined, collective bargaining is defined in Section 8(d) of the Act; it involves a negotiated agreement or any question arising thereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.720" offset="8824687">That's where you get the grievance and arbitration, adjustment of grievances provision of our national labor laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="2173.574" offset="8852167">When the unions struck to demand that Amax join the multiemployer group, didn't the NLRB file an unfair labor practices charge against them?</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel B. Gruender</label>
            <text syncTime="2186.182" offset="8902532">--Well, the employer filed an unfair labor practice charge and the National Labor Relations Board issued a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.102" offset="8926251">Eventually that complaint was found to be meritorious by the Board and the court of appeals that the union struck to force Amax into that "Peabody Group" or other multiemployer unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.178" offset="8978496">Now, let me give you a hypothesis that you might want to compare, because it's keyed to the understanding of what collective bargaining is, and you must make a determination on that issue, and if you are to determine if an 8(b)(1)(B) representative and a trust representative or an employer's representative on the trust, is engaged in collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.675" offset="9060520">We must understand the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.875" offset="9065327">The process of collective bargaining can be roughly divided into two basic categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.263" offset="9082881">One, where you're negotiating to obtain an agreement or to fashion an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.881" offset="9101376">Once that agreement is fashioned, collective bargaining does not end.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.268" offset="9118930">As a matter of fact, you then get into the grievance and arbitration process which has been sometimes called the administration of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.772" offset="9148918">The collective bargaining representatives continue and in a multiemployer type of bargaining situation the employer, quite often there'll be what we call joint grievance procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.080" offset="9194163">That is to say, the employer representative, the union representative, will sit on a grievance panel, and one of the employers who is a member of that bargaining unit, multiemployer bargaining unit, will come in, he's been violating the agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2282.559" offset="9288099">The process of collective bargaining, that's the adjustment of grievances, has been undisputedly and uniformly, where a multiemployer bargaining situation arises and the employer objects to joint resolution of grievances by a multiemployer group and says, look, they aren't collective bargaining representatives, they're adjusting grievances concerning the interpretation, application, and meaning of this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.341" offset="9383185">We don't want them to do that, and says, we're not going to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2339.329" offset="9515155">But once that trust... or, it's just like a collective bargaining agreement, and as a matter of fact, this trust is incorporated word for word into the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.101" offset="9546189">The trustees are authorized, specifically, under the agreement, to interpret, apply, and adjust, and settle its terms.</text>

            <text syncTime="2373.319" offset="9651096">It's normally through the grievance and arbitration procedure culminating in the compulsory arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.890" offset="9669382">That's so commonplace in our lexicon of labor law that everybody just accepts it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2387.178" offset="9706581">When the... and remember the statutory choice is deliberate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.982" offset="9729777">Congress was aware of compromise being an essential ingredient of collective bargaining.</text>

            <text syncTime="2401.755" offset="9764886">They chose the compromise between labor and management and they also chose the same collective bargaining methods of adjustment that they foster in that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.396" offset="9811384">For example, they said, instead of just establishing a separate organization we're going to... in order to make sure the union does what's right, we're going to subject them to the conflict that occurs sometimes between labor and management.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.738" offset="9876794">That's the best way to insure to employees the best deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.357" offset="9887243">I'll get into that in just a minute because it's very crucial, it seems to me, to understand the advantage to the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.194" offset="9914620">In other words, I believe one of the myths here is that people are thinking that the sole benefit of the employees will never be taken care of by the employer or the union, and that for some reason the employer is always trying to undermine the union or the employees and vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.240" offset="9986822">That's not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.008" offset="9989852">The key factor with most employers is, once the agreement is made, is to make sure it's enforced, and that the beneficiaries of the agreement get the best of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.030" offset="10029976">And there are quite often reasonable men disagreeing over what is the best way to do it, are both looking out for the best interests of the beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.719" offset="10060696">Insisting that employees get paid the highest wages in our country is not always good for the employees, as they sometimes find themselves priced out of the market and gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.790" offset="10092984">So an employer who resists what appears to be a liberal wage demand may in fact be benefiting the rest of the beneficiaries, the employees, in helping save the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.396" offset="10123390">The same thing is true for an unwarranted claim on a trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.015" offset="10133944">If an employer representative resisted, or a union, he may be in fact preventing a wage, the assets or corpus of the trust, for other beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.287" offset="10175008">The interests of all, sometimes, are not necessarily served by making a liberal interpretation of the fund so that it pays out things without regard to what were the basic assumptions when it was started.</text>

            <text syncTime="2574.316" offset="10455145">Now, once the distinction... there's a distinction you've got to make, because they're polevaulting over, the Government, the union... once an employer agrees to engage in multiemployer bargaining, he doesn't have a right to say, then, if we'd have joined the BCOA...

            <text syncTime="2635.439" offset="10699547">Remember, multiemployer trusts do not exist outside of multiemployer bargaining.</text>

            <text syncTime="3358.245" offset="13590780">The section of the Act, 501(3) that says, the term 2; the clear delineation of the employer and employee representatives have a specific meaning, at least to employer and employee representatives; and the use of the term "neutral".</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.296" offset="13690985">Now, that means that somebody has a flavor to them, or a bias, if you will.</text>

            <text syncTime="3408.696" offset="13792654">All we can say is that that's just simply not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.148" offset="13806447">For example, if this particular union wished to maintain the same program, it could have gone to the bargaining table and insisted that the employer put up a duplicate fund, not with the same, with the representatives, but with the employers' representatives, and could have offered reciprocity to give them the portability, it could have offered the same benefits and could have struck for that and there would have been no violation of the law in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.864" offset="13901323">If, on the other hand, they insisted on forcing him into another bargaining unit, a bargaining unit which in fact has a long history... I need not cite authority for it... of disruptions, labor disputes, which have caused problems with those funds... that not only does an injustice to the Belle Ayr employees, who had nothing to do with those disputes and disruptions and could do nothing to prevent them through the grievance or arbitration procedure or any other way, it just does violence to the whole procedure of bargaining unit by unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.950" offset="14021591">No destruction of collective bargaining is going to come about as a result of this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.454" offset="14051684">As a matter of fact, multiemployer trusts will stand or fall on their ability to provide to the employees whom they cover, and to the employers that they serve, what they hold themselves out to do, which is better benefits at less cost, with the same amount of portability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.879" offset="14109363">That, frankly, they have had a lot of favored treatment in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.315" offset="14127126">Forty-year amortization schedules as opposed to 30, no... very seldom are they covered with termination insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.754" offset="14152830">So they've had a little different set of rules to play with and, frankly, many of the employers have been able to develop better programs for their employees at less cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.293" offset="14195044">Now, there is no reason in God's world that I can see or in the National Labor Relations Act or reason or logic to require employers to be subjected to demands that they have representatives determining those fringe benefits, or be compelled to accept the strike, or take a strike, on an issue like that when those people stand almost on the same footing, in terms of function, from the standpoint of the labor laws, as an 8(b)(1)(B) representative who is adjusting the grievances concerning the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
