            <text syncTime="67.125" offset="438580">This is an antitrust case in the health care area.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.831" offset="469405">The issue turns on the construction of the National Health Planning and Resource Development Act of 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.237" offset="507021">No constitutional question is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.308" offset="531367">The statute is long and diffuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.478" offset="552056">The respondents rely on 28 fairly general words in the statute as the basis for their contention that they have implied immunity from the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.173" offset="618825">We contend that there is no room for such a construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.760" offset="645157">The district court accepted the implied immunity argument and granted summary judgment for the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.051" offset="690296">That judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit and this Court granted certiorari to review that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.459" offset="743899">The question arises on these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.012" offset="762185">National Gerimedical Hospital is a fully accredited general acute care community hospital which opened in October, 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.456" offset="827909">It has been continuously licensed by the Missouri Division of Health, that is, the state agency, since September, 1977, and has been fully certified for Medicare and Medicaid by the Department of Health and Human Services, as it now is, since its opening.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.773" offset="929160">It did not receive a certificate of need from any Missouri state agency because Missouri had no certificate of need requirement, when it was built.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.033" offset="994257">The respondents are Blue Cross of Kansas City and Blue Cross Association, both of which market and sell prepaid health reimbursement plans to the public and make contracts with health care providers to administer the plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.283" offset="1095194">Several other persons are also named as nondefendant coconspirators.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.289" offset="1127273">Prior to its opening the petitioner sought to make a participating agreement with Blue Cross.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.793" offset="1161232">A participating hospital receives direct reimbursement of 100 percent for covered services rendered to individual Blue Cross members.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.970" offset="1217970">If the hospital is not granted participation, then Blue Cross pays no more than 80 percent of the cost of the services and it makes the payment directly to the subscriber and not to the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.349" offset="1295501">A lack of participating hospital status discourages Blue Cross subscribers and their doctors from seeking service at National Gerimedical and places the hospital at a substantial competitive disadvantage.</text>

            <text syncTime="316.522" offset="1436144">The question is whether there is any statutory authorization, state or federal, for restricting the construction of this hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.847" offset="1489434">And it is, as I have said, Missouri had no certificate of need legislation at the relevant time here.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.620" offset="1520572">There was nothing illegal or inappropriate about the building of this hospital, and the question really is whether Congress by passing this statute has authorized private groups to enforce that approach to the question of the cost of medical care which you have suggested, and our position is that Congress has made no such authorization.</text>

            <text syncTime="878.835" offset="3685392">Now, the respondents here rely on a provision of the statute which is set out on page 2 of our blue brief, and at various other places in the brief, which provides that</text>

            <text syncTime="940.292" offset="3931256">And the respondents say, look, that's all we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.160" offset="3942750">We just complied with that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.129" offset="3954662">There was a plan and we undertook to help MAHSA implement it.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.318" offset="3991338">The significance of that section of the statute on which the respondents' case entirely turns becomes clearer when the entire context of the statute is examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.698" offset="4068869">It's a long statute, perhaps less intricate than the Internal Revenue Code, but more diffuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.387" offset="4103664">And in an effort to assist the Court in determining how the various parts of the statute mesh, we've included substantial excerpts from it in the Appendix to our reply brief, the yellow brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.016" offset="4178166">Actually, the statute itself is 55 pages long in the Statutes at Large.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.037" offset="4202198">It would be more that in this print, and I have included some 15 pages of it here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1105.516" offset="4592154">Now, in the statute Congress set up a planning structure in several tiers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.120" offset="4618590">At the very top there is a National Council on Health Planning and Development, and then there are statewide health coordinating councils.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.893" offset="4665715">They are to take care of a situation like Missouri where there's one group in St. Louis and another group in Kansas City, so there's a statewide one which coordinates them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.885" offset="4709601">Neither of these is involved in this case, and I have not included in the Appendix the statutory provisions relating to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.074" offset="4754427">But when the statute is examined it becomes clear that the key distinction is between the next two tiers of agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.464" offset="4795909">These are health system agencies, HSA, on the one hand, and state health planning and development agencies on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.208" offset="4850975">I have found from my work on this case that it is very easy to confuse them, and I suggest to the Court that it is very important not to confuse them, that they are different agencies with different functions, and MAHSA... Mid-America Health Planning Agency... is a health systems agency and not a state health planning and development agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.875" offset="4965601">Now, the codifiers in the U.S. Code have helped out a little bit because the health systems agencies are all in the 300L sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.070" offset="5030384">Now "ell" becomes confusing when you put it in print because it looks like "one" so we've put it in italics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.324" offset="5059433">But there are several sections printed in the Appendix through, near the bottom of page 4a, which are 300L's, and they all relate to health systems agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.452" offset="5127873">But Congress knew that state health planning and development agencies were something very different, and in the codification they are in the 300m sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.545" offset="5188268">And they begin at the bottom of page 4a and continue to the page 15a in the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.770" offset="5229124">Now, if you will look at Section 300L-1(b)(1) which is on the first page of the Appendix, you will see that a health systems agency for a health service area must be one of three types of entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.916" offset="5313761">It can be (a) a nonprofit private corporation, and that's what MAHSA is, Mid-American Health Planning Agency is a nonprofit private corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.443" offset="5371857">It can also be a public regional planning body or it can be a single unit of general local government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.263" offset="5399129">But MAHSA is not one of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.251" offset="5419086">Under subsequent provisions in the 300L sections, health systems agencies including MAHSA are given what I call grass roots responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.891" offset="5473630">Their basic function is to gather information and make recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.045" offset="5494319">This is shown by the passage in the Senate report which is printed on the bottom half of page four of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.670" offset="5540817">The report says that the responsibilities of the health systems agencies are the accumulation of data in order to assess the existing status of the health care delivery system in the area it serves, and developing short and long term recommendations in order to achieve the rational and equitable distribution of personal health care services throughout its planning agency area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.843" offset="5677490">An important part in the legislative history is the Senate report which is printed on page five of our reply brief, where the Senate said that</text>

            <text syncTime="1398.607" offset="5764530">--the Senate committee said...</text>

            <text syncTime="1987.550" offset="8120252">The statutory scheme that Mr. Griswold described resulted in, of course, the 8th Circuit determining that there was an implied exemption created by this national health planning and resources development statute from the impact of the antitrust laws, because there was a repugnancy between the statute, which was enacted subsequent to the antitrust laws, which of course have been fundamental laws in this country since 1980, at least the Sherman Antitrust Act has.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.493" offset="8276046">We do not contend that there can never be implied exemption from the antitrust laws, but we are mindful that the teachings of this Court are that an implication from, an implied exemption from a regulatory statute is strongly disfavored and would be found only in cases of a plain repugnancy between the antitrust acts and the regulatory provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2086.816" offset="8517313">I think the principles would be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.935" offset="8529852">If the Congress has enacted a comprehensive scheme and then enacts subsequent legislation, if there is a conflict it's the duty of the Court to try to give meaning to both statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.593" offset="8584500">And if the Court cannot give meaning to both statutes because of a plain repugnancy, then it will find that the later statute pro tanto, by implication, modified the earlier one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.435" offset="8639880">And so I don't think it makes any difference for the problem of statutory construction whether we're talking about the Logan Act or the Sherman Act or Capper-Volstead, or whatever it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.243" offset="8691080">We contend here that there is no plain repugnancy, and that this Court's attention to this matter can really be concluded at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.903" offset="8741757">The Joint Appendix contains, of course, the opinion of the 8th Circuit, which adopts, after making its own ascertainment of repugnancy, the findings of the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.345" offset="8807482">I would like to direct the attention of the Court to page 187a of the Joint Appendix, in the sentence just before the paragraph break about a quarter of a page down, and with leave of the Court I'd like to read that sentence if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.509" offset="8888148">The district judge wrote,</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.795" offset="8901313">"If the court were to find that private business working in conjunction with a health systems agency established by the Act in their area to achieve the goals of the Act were liable or might be liable under the antitrust law for their actions, then the court believes that the accomplishment of the purpose of the goals of the Act would be effectively foreclosed. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.643" offset="8992637">Now, that's as close as either of these courts gets to the finding of a plain repugnancy, and yet on several occasions this Court has held that activities which come clearly within the jurisdiction of a regulatory agency nevertheless may be subject to scrutiny under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.592" offset="9084484">As Mr. Griswold has pointed out, the National Health Planning and Resource Development Act of 1974, which is the basic piece of legislation here, created two types, at least two types of agencies; one, the health systems agency, of which MAHSA, the Mid-America Health Systems Agency... which was, incidentally, a multistate agency... is one; and it created the state agency, or authorized the creation of a state agency which, as he pointed out, didn't exist at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.067" offset="9242368">All the first type of agency, the health systems agency, could do is plan and recommend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.906" offset="9273715">It could do nothing more than plan and recommend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.608" offset="9284477">And the district court, and subsequently the Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, found that respondent here, who is accused of having conspired with MAHSA and others to prevent the entry of petitioner into a hospital agreement, to prevent petitioner and Blue Cross from entering into an agreement, somehow violated a regulatory scheme with a clear and plain repugnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.457" offset="9487919">And that just isn't so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.774" offset="9493144">Because all the Act required was cooperation with the health systems agency, and if a private party like Blue Cross in this case is immune from the antitrust acts, just because it does what it thinks a health planning agency would like it to do, and at that point the approval of this Court, we've moved a long way from cases like United States v. RCA, California v. FPC, U.S. v. Borden Company, Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, where there was strict regulation by an agency, and yet the Court found a place for the application of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.394" offset="9711632">We contend that in the absence of a strict repugnancy the Court can conclude its consideration of this matter here, because there isn't any repugnancy between the activities of the health systems agency and the antitrust laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="2437.160" offset="9918730">And the case would have to go back if this Court agrees that there is no implied exemption from the antitrust laws to see whether petitioner can actually establish it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2547.479" offset="10359991">But we're in an area here where it's necessary to determine whether Congress intended by implication to exempt certain private activity which is to be totally unregulated from the impact of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.374" offset="10439612">And we submit that this Court has never done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.326" offset="10451419">I can't think of a single instance where this Court by implication has found that the Congress by implication meant to enable a private party to do the things forbidden by the antitrust acts when there was no other regulatory scheme imposed to promote competitive activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.758" offset="10537101">And we say it's particularly, the error is particularly egregious here because in this National Health Planning Act the Congress made express exemptions from the antitrust laws and did not exempt the behavior condemned here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.087" offset="10618394">It expressly in 1974 exempted, or immunized, and in a qualified way, too, because it was for good faith and nonnegligent activity, individuals who would participate in a health systems planning activity from money damages only, and not from injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.150" offset="10698642">Subsequently, in 1979, it extended the immunity, again just for money damages, to the health systems agencies and specifically rejected an effort on the part of the Senate to immunize persons who might cooperate with them, which would have been, possibly, Blue Cross in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.201" offset="10798848">And we set these matters out on pages 25 through 27 in the Government's brief, and we say that where there is an express exemption this Court should be reluctant to find an implied blanket exemption which would be broader than the qualified exemption expressly made by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.249" offset="10899054">We think that the Congress was certainly concerned with delivering quality health services at reasonable cost to the American people, but that it did not intend it to be done in disregard of the antitrust laws, that it intended the antitrust laws to coexist except to the extent that it made express exceptions with its planning system, which is set out in the statute that Mr. Griswold described in his argument to the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="4547.826" offset="18361402">Here they had been part of the MAHSA as Congress said they should be, they helped to create the plan, the plan says the number one priority in the area is the elimination of excess capacity, the number one priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4566.054" offset="18434335">Blue Cross then delegates, according to the complaint, Blue Cross has delegated its certificate of need position to MAHSA.</text>
            <text syncTime="4576.596" offset="18476445">Blue Cross then said to MAHSA... or says to the petitioner, the sole exclusive reason we're turning you down... that's what the complaint says, the sole and exclusive reason we're turning you down is because MAHSA has not said you need it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.253" offset="18535064">What was Blue Cross supposed to do in that situation, then?</text>

            <text syncTime="4604.845" offset="18589503">One is whether there's a violation of the antitrust laws, which we don't have to decide, and secondly whether, assuming there was a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4612.466" offset="18619909">I mean, it may well be that they could have done exactly what they did without violating the antitrust laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="4618.537" offset="18644255">I'd rather not get into that but for present purposes, obviously, we're assuming a violation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4624.906" offset="18669751">Otherwise we don't have to reach this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4627.125" offset="18678633">In its reply brief petitioner states that all involved in 1979 would have been quite surprised to hear that Congress had already impliedly repealed the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4643.070" offset="18742371">Nevertheless, the Solicitor General in his amicus brief states unequivocally at page 16, note 11... I'd like to quote:</text>
            <text syncTime="4655.795" offset="18793258">"To be sure, there are some activities that must. "</text>

            <text syncTime="4660.898" offset="18813738">"by implication be immune from antitrust attack, if HSAs and state agencies are to exercise their authorized powers. "</text>
            <text syncTime="4669.302" offset="18847279">So the Solicitor General concedes that there would be repeal of antitrust by implication when private parties assist the HSAs in developing plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="4679.410" offset="18887717">But that's not all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4680.727" offset="18893046">The Solicitor General goes on:</text>
            <text syncTime="4682.945" offset="18901823">"There may be occasions in implementing. "</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.997" offset="18914048">--note, he uses the word "implementing" and not just "recommending"...</text>
            <text syncTime="4689.899" offset="18929722">"in implementing health systems plans when an implied exemption might be necessary in order to effectuate the statutory scheme as required by Congress. "</text>
            <text syncTime="4701.174" offset="18974757">In a word, what the Solicitor is conceding here is that there's room for a narrow, implied exemption from antitrust.</text>
            <text syncTime="4709.312" offset="19007357">We say that the limited facts on the record before this Court, not a blanket exemption, not somebody who's interested in goals and goes along and does things on their own, but on the limited facts here, we have the agency making a determination to avoid excess capacity, which it calls the number one priority for implementation; where according to the complaint Blue Cross designated the health systems agency as the agency to conduct need review; and the hearing of the agency, the Solicitor General says at page 16, note 11, was public and open and carefully supervised.</text>
            <text syncTime="4747.770" offset="19161166">Not some private interloper; public and open and carefully supervised, and the Solicitor General is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4756.091" offset="19194499">Now, it should also be emphasized that once the Solicitor General concedes that there is repeal of antitrust by implication in some cases, this demolishes the rationale of the expressio unius argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4771.536" offset="19256252">Expressio unius means that if we said one thing, then everything else is out.</text>

            <text syncTime="5024.510" offset="20268131">And the Solicitor General has made an argument in its brief at various points, stating that the Health Planning Act specifically provides for judicial review of state certificate of need determinations in state court, and that there is no similar statutory provision for judicial review of health systems agency determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5047.626" offset="20360605">The premise of the Solicitor General is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="5050.828" offset="20373457">The citations at pages 9, 15, and 24 of the brief are all to the 1979 act, not to the 1974 act, which is the only act involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5065.071" offset="20430404">There was no provision in the 1974 act with respect to judicial review of state certificate of need provisions, so that particular foundation falls apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="5079.314" offset="20487351">Also overlooked here is the fact that the health systems agencies are directly answerable to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and their health systems plans are subject to review by the Secretary to assure that they conform to national guidelines on such things as hospital beds per capita and very relevant provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5101.661" offset="20576690">If the Secretary's review is unsatisfactory to any affected person, that person may then seek judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5109.766" offset="20609186">Now, throughout here, the problem that petitioner has is it never asked anyone to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="5114.737" offset="20629039">It never went to MAHSA, it never said, do you know, we have not an acute care hospital, we just take care of the elderly?</text>
            <text syncTime="5122.324" offset="20659341">And maybe your determination with respect to acute care hospitals is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="5127.562" offset="20680344">In its complaint it says it was very special.</text>
            <text syncTime="5129.414" offset="20687762">It was going to be a national hospital for the elderly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5132.199" offset="20698838">They also possibly could have gone to MAHSA and said, well, this little suburb of Lee's Summit, where we're going to build our hospital, they really need a hospital there, they really do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5142.572" offset="20740425">And therefore you ought to give us, you ought to say, there's enough beds, but we need another 120-bed hospital up there in Lee's Summit.</text>

            <text syncTime="5151.010" offset="20774175">The fact that petitioner doesn't ask doesn't eliminate the capacity to ask, it doesn't eliminate the fact that there was complete due process in terms of the promulgation of the plan and it doesn't eliminate the fact this is not like Silver, it bears no resemblance to Silver.</text>
            <text syncTime="5168.536" offset="20844288">In this situation the petitioner could have gone to MAHSA, it could have asked... it might have been turned down, but that doesn't eliminate the due process... and then it could have gone up through the Secretary and then into court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5179.925" offset="20889846">Particularly here, petitioner has pointed out that there was only a conditional designation of the health systems agency, a conditional designation meant there was a 90-day contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5192.817" offset="20941359">There were contracts between the Secretary, Mr. Law, between the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the MAHSA.</text>
            <text syncTime="5201.090" offset="20974482">And a contract meant money followed after you signed your contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5205.059" offset="20990365">That contract was cancellable in 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="5208.011" offset="21002172">Petitioner could have gone to the Secretary and said, along the lines of, cancel that contract, give them 90 days notice, cancel them, because there's a desperate need for a hospital here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5219.133" offset="21046580">There isn't any need for the hospital; there's no such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5222.502" offset="21060059">Now, the petitioner in his reply brief quotes very extensively at page 10 from Undersecretary Hale Champion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5241.397" offset="21135710">If one reads what is said there, it is quite clear that Mr. Champion in that slice of time said, there is indeed implied repeal from antitrust laws in some situations; this is what he says.</text>
            <text syncTime="5260.025" offset="21210211">The concern is misplaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="5262.377" offset="21219615">If the agency itself considers the questions and makes the decisions based on an institutions's specific kind of data, then we don't think, we don't think there are any antitrust questions involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5275.637" offset="21272592">Then he goes on... I'll come back to the next paragraph in a moment... then he says,</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.005" offset="21286071">"I think in some cases there has been an effort to make people more worried about that subject than they ought to be. "</text>

            <text syncTime="5286.443" offset="21315850">The place where Mr. Champion has a problem is that the agency delegates the responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="5292.763" offset="21341137">That turns the facts in our case topsy turvy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5296.800" offset="21357333">The agency didn't delegate the responsibility to Blue Cross.</text>
            <text syncTime="5299.835" offset="21369454">Blue Cross, according to the complaint here, delegated to the health systems agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="5307.006" offset="21398084">Now, we're told by petitioner, that the agency administering the planning act had a specific interpretation and had it obviously escaped their attention that there was any implied repeal?</text>
            <text syncTime="5319.999" offset="21450120">With respect, petitioner has a very short memory.</text>
            <text syncTime="5325.068" offset="21470391">In the brief of respondent, Blue Cross of Kansas City, in reply to the brief of amicus curiae, there's a letter from Secretary Harris to Attorney General Civiletti, and at page 5 Secretary Harris says,</text>
            <text syncTime="5341.845" offset="21537473">"Both the district court and the 8th Circuit held that the Act provides an implied exemption from the antitrust laws for Blue Cross conduct and accordingly dismissed the complaint. "</text>
            <text syncTime="5353.737" offset="21585016">"This is consistent with this Department's legal interpretation of the Act and our policy for the implementation of the Act. "</text>
            <text syncTime="5364.795" offset="21629320">Just as does the petitioner, we turn to the agency administering the planning act for guidance as of that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5379.954" offset="21689924">To conclude, the plain repugnancy of the Health Planning Act of 1974 and the antitrust laws is illuminated by the very discrete facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5393.245" offset="21743109">We submit that in 1974... in 1974, now... Congress did not intend to visit possible antitrust liability on Blue Cross for cooperating with the local health systems agency to implement that agency's plan, which found that excess hospital beds were leading to high financial cost for the community, not to speak of increased morbidity and mortality.</text>
            <text syncTime="5420.697" offset="21852928">No rational Congress would direct a health systems agency to seek to implement a plan with the assistance of providers, providers like Blue Cross... stated to be a provider in the statute... and then to intend to leave those providers exposed to possible antitrust treble damages because it furnished the assistance to the health systems agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="5459.922" offset="22009767">In the brief time remaining I would like to cover a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="5467.762" offset="22041114">Mr. Greenberg said that antitrust was simply ignored in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="5475.849" offset="22073506">This was before Rex Hospital and other cases and everybody assumed there wasn't any antitrust problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.105" offset="22102554">That, of course, is quite inconsistent with the statute which Congress passed, because it did include in Section 3 JUL-1(4) 15 lines dealing with exemption from liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="5507.920" offset="22201819">"Except as provided in subparagraph (b)(1) a health system agency shall not by reason of the performance of any duty, function, or activity, required of or authorized to be undertaken by the agency, be liable for the payment of damages under any law of the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="5527.234" offset="22279037">And it goes on that the exemption extends only to health system agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5533.205" offset="22302966">The next paragraph applies to...</text>
            <text syncTime="5538.609" offset="22324490">"No individual member of the governing body of the health systems agency or employee shall be liable under any law of the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="5548.547" offset="22364301">but there is nothing there that is broad enough to cover Blue Cross.</text>

            <text syncTime="5570.830" offset="22453431">--that was what was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5571.663" offset="22456775">It does not say specifically the antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5574.365" offset="22467537">Now, this is covered specifically at the bottom of page 25 of the Solicitor General's brief, and in our reply brief we have relied further on the 1979 act where that exemption was broadened, and there wouldn't have been any need to broaden it if Congress had assumed, well, we've already granted them implied exemption from the antitrust acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5607.086" offset="22598463">Now, reference was made to the footnote in the Solicitor General's brief, which indicates that there might be some implied immunity from the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="5620.927" offset="22653842">The plans include recommendations about centralizing certain specialized services in particular hospitals for the purpose of improving care.</text>
            <text syncTime="5633.920" offset="22705774">For example, there might be two hospitals two blocks apart duplicating services and they might agree that the obstetrical work would be done in one hospital and the cardiac work be done in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="5651.932" offset="22777872">I don't think that that is really a question of implied immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5657.102" offset="22798456">I think that is really a question of rule of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="5664.956" offset="22829908">It is a question related to what this Court has before it now in the Maricopa County case coming from Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="5673.211" offset="22862926">It may well be that such agreements under these circumstances in the health care area do not violate the antitrust law, not because they're exempt but because the proper construction of the antitrust laws is that they were not intended to be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="5691.257" offset="22935129">In this case Congress made it plain both in the statute and in the committee reports that regulatory functions could be exercised only by state health planning and development agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5708.218" offset="23002943">MAHSA had no such powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5711.753" offset="23017153">There's nothing under which Blue Cross Association can find umbrage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5718.240" offset="23043067">Their effort to do so not only finds no support in the statute but is a clear infringement on the sovereign choice made by the state of Missouri.</text>
