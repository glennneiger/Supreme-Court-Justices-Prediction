            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="8.730" offset="126964">This case also comes to us by way of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.921" offset="159669">The respondent, William Manypenny was employed as a Border Patrol Agent in the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.835" offset="199375">In one night in 1976 while he and another agent were patrolling the Sweetwater Pass in Pima County, Arizona approximately 10 miles from the Mexican border, they came across three persons suspected of being illegal alien entrance.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.794" offset="275235">And during the encounter, agent Manypenny fired a shotgun and seriously wounded one of the suspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.460" offset="305850">Manypenny was indicted for a commission of a state crime that is assault with a deadly weapon and violation of an Arizona statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.841" offset="343362">However, because this charge arose from an act committed while he was on duty as a federal Border Patrol Agent, Manypenny as he could remove the case from state court into federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.656" offset="406683">A jury trial took place there and a verdict of guilty was returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.078" offset="428312">But thereafter, the District Court concluded that Manypenny had a valid immunity defense and entered a judgment of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.589" offset="466346">The State of Arizona appealed but the federal Court of Appeals dismissed the case or the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.567" offset="498320">It held that a criminal proceeding removed to a federal court arose under federal law and accordingly is controlled by that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.260" offset="537086">The Court rejected the suggestion that Arizona's appeal was authorized by Section 1291 of Title 28 a jurisdictional statute relating to appeals from final judgments of federal District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.132" offset="604586">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we hold that in a criminal proceeding removed from a state to federal court, a State may appeal if statutory authority to seek such review is conferred by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.836" offset="671355">Because Arizona law conferred such authority here and because the removal does not alter the nature of the authority conferred, the State must be allowed to appeal from the judgment of acquittal entered after the verdict of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.179" offset="736766">The defendant by obtaining a federal forum fully vindicated in the federal policy supporting removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.719" offset="762888">No further purpose of the removal statute would be served by denying the State the right to seek review when that very right is available under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.615" offset="806461">We think it would be anomalous to conclude that the State's appellate right which it clearly had under state law was diminished solely because of the removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.513" offset="846062">Section 1291 neither compels nor forecloses appellate jurisdiction over an appeal taken by a state as prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.437" offset="881798">Instead, it permits the State to appeal if it is authorized to do so by a state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.439" offset="909801">Arizona can rely on Section 1291 combined with appellate authorization from the Arizona legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.954" offset="943865">And in the circumstances of this case no more is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.345" offset="961419">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed and the cases remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion filed today.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.681" offset="1002693">Mr. Justice Stevens, while joining the opinion, has filed a separate concurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.970" offset="1023904">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion and has joined therein by Mr. Justice Marshall.</text>
