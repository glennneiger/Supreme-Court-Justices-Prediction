            <text syncTime="8.329" offset="125320">The first of these is 79-1764, Texas Department of Commissioner of Affairs against Burdine.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.431" offset="165757">This case comes to us on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.776" offset="187178">It involves a proper evidentiary burden borne by an employer in a discrimination suit brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.991" offset="235974">The Court of Appeals held that when a discharged employee proves a prima facie case of discrimination, the employer then must prove by preponderance of the evidence that nondiscriminatory reasons existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.638" offset="306610">The Court further held that the employer also must prove that the person retained in the position at issue was better qualified than the rejected employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.365" offset="361467">We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the Circuits as to the appropriate burden of proof to rebut a prima facie case of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.346" offset="413398">Our prior cases have held that the employerâ€™s burden is to identify clearly by evidence a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the employment decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.243" offset="477032">This is merely a burden of going forward with the evidence, the overall burden of persuasion remands throughout the case with the plaintiff employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.099" offset="524471">We think the Court of Appeals misunderstood our prior decisions and imposed an inappropriate burden of proof on the employer in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.294" offset="565222">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the case remanded for the application of the correct legal standard.</text>
