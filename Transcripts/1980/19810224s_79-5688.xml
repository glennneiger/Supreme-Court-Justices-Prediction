            <text syncTime="8.967" offset="127908">This case is here on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.878" offset="155493">After petitioner's first criminal trial, the judge granted a motion for a new trial on the ground that the evidence as a matter of law was insufficient to support the jury's guilty verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.831" offset="215366">The question presented here is whether the Double Jeopardy Clause bars the State from prosecuting petitioner a second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.073" offset="260297">We think this case is controlled by our decision rendered two times ago in Burks against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.010" offset="296032">In that case, an appellate court had concluded that the states evidence was legally insufficient to support a guilty verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.133" offset="336574">A defendant in a criminal trial is entitled to an acquittal, unless the State presents at the first trial sufficient evidence to support a verdict or judgment guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.966" offset="391849">Accordingly in Burks, we held that there could be no retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.528" offset="418076">For the same reason we hold today, that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial of petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.031" offset="452140">Accordingly, the judgment of the Louisiana Supreme Court is reversed.</text>
