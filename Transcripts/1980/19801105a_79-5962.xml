            <text syncTime="1340.418" offset="5505318">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.201" offset="5508453">Under Gerstein v. Pugh, and the other cases, I don't believe that there is any possibility of this Court giving any relief whatsoever to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.976" offset="5555578">As a matter of fact, he's received a determination that there was probable cause to arrest him on at least three different occasions, varying in reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.384" offset="5601240">First, at the scene of the crime, when he was arrested while driving and in an intoxicated state, he admitted, the arresting officer determined that there was probable cause to arrest him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.960" offset="5655575">Now there was an impression perhaps left that he later stated that he had been drinking eight hours earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.197" offset="5684518">Actually, he testified at the evidentiary hearing... it was quite clear at the final revocation hearing that he had been drinking for seven or eight hours, and he stated, I took my first drink eight hours ago, and admitted that he had been drinking wine, beer, and schnapps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.474" offset="5745540">Now, at the scene of the arrest he didn't go into that detail as to exactly what liquors he had been drinking but he did admit that he was drunk to the officer, who had stopped him under the circumstances in which he was driving his car in irregular manner and in which he observed him in what he believed to be an intoxicated state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.120" offset="5820146">Not only did the arresting officer believe there was probable cause but the arresting officer immediately called the man's probation officer who met them at the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.059" offset="5859957">At the jail they had conversations with him after giving him Miranda warnings for I believe 45 minutes, the record reflects, and the probation officer testified at the revocation hearing, no doubt that the man was drunk; he made no bones about the fact that he was drunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.605" offset="5926099">The probation officer testified that the reason he had come to the jail was because the police officer had called him to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.775" offset="5954834">All right, now, all this occurred on February 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.127" offset="5968208">The record apparently reflects that Mr. Vincent was allowed to go home for the weekend because on February 6 there was an arrest warrant obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.184" offset="6008437">It appears on page 18 of the Appendix and differentiates this case from Gerstein v. Pugh, and from Morrissey and from Gagnon v. Scarpelli.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.576" offset="6062040">On the 6th the arresting officer and the probation officer went to the magistrate, to the judge, and told him what had happened and presented evidence to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.634" offset="6102269">And he issued an arrest warrant which recited, having heard and considered the evidence offered by the State in support thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.971" offset="6127555">That was an ex parte proceeding but nevertheless it constituted judicial review of the decision to arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2074.513" offset="8441691">It's perhaps unfortunate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.262" offset="8448691">It was clearly the intent of the legislature and the Court of Criminal Appeals has stated this on three occasions, that the purpose of that statute was to augment the general right to a speedy hearing which had already held in these matters, by an even stricter statutory right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.259" offset="8524760">About the same time they passed a Speedy Trial Act in general applicable to everyone else who was not on probation, of course, and in that Act they stated that certain consequences would flow from violation of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.698" offset="8570527">Of course, they didn't do the same thing in the statute, and in response to your suggestion that it's a flaw in our argument, we don't think that there's any question but that our procedures are valid, even if we didn't have the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.474" offset="8629563">And the fact that we have it merely illustrates an even additional attempt to assure that probationers are not allowed to remain in jail indefinitely before they have their hearing.</text>
