            <label>Mr. Clifford D. Pierce, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="72.628" offset="438556">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="75.659" offset="450676">The City of Memphis petitioned for certiorari in this Court solely because of what we perceive to be a clear and inherent danger in the majority opinion of the 6th Circuit to the ability of this nation's cities to effectively balance all the conflicting interests which come before them and effectively govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.228" offset="536985">In short, we saw the danger which we believe Judge Celebrezze saw, in the dissenting opinion, Judge Celebrezze having been mayor of one of the great cities of this country, and also, some of the concerns that were expressed by this Court in Washington v. Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.284" offset="605112">In every democracy, the legislative and administrative parts of that democracy have the burden to weigh conflicting and competing interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.874" offset="659552">Inevitably, in any such decision, there will be winners and losers.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.809" offset="687241">And depending upon whose ox is gored, the party that is not successful will feel either irritated or disappointed or in some respects angered.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.115" offset="740531">This case, may it please the Court, started as a routine street closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.534" offset="766131">It started, not with the City itself, but with residents of a small winding neighborhood street in a subdivision known as Hein Park.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.280" offset="805106">The reason which these neighbors gave abutting this street was the fact that this very narrow, less than two-lane street, or approximately two-lane street, had taken on a tremendous amount of traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.102" offset="864456">They sought to control the traffic going through that small residential neighborhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.163" offset="888698">They sought to protect the pedestrians, both those living within the neighborhood and without the neighborhood, particularly the children who were walking to and from school.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.252" offset="925060">They also sought to control litter and pollution, things that go with traffic, unfortunately, and things that this Court has recognized as being a legitimate purpose to control.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.983" offset="968005">West Drive itself, as I have indicated, is a very narrow, winding, almost country-type street.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.901" offset="999666">There are no curbs or gutters or sidewalks.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.338" offset="1009383">It is, at its entrance into Jackson Avenue, about 25 feet wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.695" offset="1038850">If cars are parked on either side, it ceases to be a two-lane street.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.958" offset="1055881">Hein Park itself is a small in-town, inner city neighborhood approximately 60 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.126" offset="1096528">The geographical borders are such that it is bordered on three sides by major streets, four and six-lane streets, most of which carry heavy commercial traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.354" offset="1153475">West Drive, as it comes into Jackson Avenue, which is one of these major commercial streets and is on the north side, is, as I have indicated, 25 feet wide.</text>

            <text syncTime="504.533" offset="2166190">As I say, I think the map will show this, there are seven other entrances into Hein Park, including two from the north, so that, one of the complaints made by the plaintiffs in this case was that they wanted to come down Springdale Street, and that they were being effectively shut out of Hein Park and would not to be permitted to come into Hein Park for racial or other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.956" offset="2295862">Actually, all they would have to do would be to make a turn either to the east or to the west of about 100 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.548" offset="2326164">If they turn to the east 100 feet, they can proceed into Cypress Drive, which runs into Center Drive, which runs right into North Parkway.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.310" offset="2357302">If they go to the west, they can go about 100 feet, they can go into Charles Place, which runs into West Drive, and they will be back out again at the Parkway.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.900" offset="2399620">The other entrances into Hein Park are at North Drive and at East Drive, on the east, of course; Center Drive on the west, on the south; and Charles Place, which runs in, in effect, from Southwestern, to the west.</text>

            <text syncTime="597.933" offset="2539741">This is certainly an inner city neighborhood, and one deemed worthy of support, as are all.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.086" offset="2568371">The neighbors themselves sought what we believe were legitimate constitutional reasons to improve the quality of life within that neighborhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.110" offset="2628453">The disparate impact, if it exists, I believe was properly pointed out by Judge Celebrezze, really exists between residents and nonresidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.323" offset="2693341">It is perhaps a little more convenient for those living on West Drive, that they would be most likely to proceed to the south and to go onto North Parkway, than the others, who may want to come across, but that it is certainly not a racial impact, really one of geography.</text>

            <text syncTime="769.629" offset="3226552">There were some very strong opinions about it, one reason being it was the first time it had really been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.065" offset="3248286">On a number of occasions streets had been closed.</text>

            <text syncTime="794.791" offset="3327176">This case was handled just like every other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.820" offset="3347343">There was a very active hearing before the Council, and I might state to Your Honors that in the hearing before the Council race was really not an issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="919.415" offset="3825697">The barrier is not the Berlin Wall.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.821" offset="3831339">The way it is established, it consists of two low curbs, one abutting Jackson Avenue, one abutting West Drive.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.785" offset="3875121">There is a small planting area between Jackson Avenue and the sidewalk.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.970" offset="3903855">There is then a sidewalk which is a continuation of all the other sidewalks along Jackson Avenue, which abuts the blacktop.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.608" offset="3938441">So one point that was raised by the plaintiffs in their brief that there would be a problem with pedestrian traffic is simply not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.463" offset="3985880">There is no way that there would be a trespass, technical or otherwise, for pedestrians desiring to come off of Jackson Avenue and go onto West Drive.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.630" offset="4030497">They can walk down the blacktop, or under our city ordinances, where there are no sidewalks, they're permitted to walk within 10 feet off the road, without any danger of trespassing.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.204" offset="4072815">So there is no technical trespass or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.234" offset="4084936">Now, the Court is, I'm certain, familiar with the fact that the original petition, complaint, filed in this cause was dismissed and this case went to the 6th Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.510" offset="4146063">And the court remanded that back to the district court, setting out some rather basic ground rules, primarily a ground rule that for the plaintiffs to prevail there had to be discriminatory intent, and intent shown that the City of Memphis had granted to these residents of this predominantly white, or white residential area, a right that they had not granted to black citizens within the City of Memphis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.746" offset="4290990">During the hearing of the trial court, that statement from the 6th Circuit, which it later in Greene II stated was dicta, we urged that upon the court, that that was really the issue facing him, Judge McRae, in that hearing, on the whole matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.501" offset="4397987">The judge did not agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.093" offset="4412407">Instead he had a full hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.326" offset="4425364">He had, in effect, an Arlington Heights hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.607" offset="4438425">He let everything in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.826" offset="4447307">The plaintiffs were permitted to produce every bit of evidence they had with respect to racial impact, and with respect to racial intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.948" offset="4483774">The respondents have argued that the trial judge... and so did the majority in the 6th Circuit... argued that the trial judge had felt himself too constrained by the mandate of the 6th Circuit in Greene I.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.173" offset="4556707">And it was because of that constraint that he found no intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.360" offset="4573426">It's simply not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.656" offset="4578650">As I indicated, the record will indicate a very full hearing on this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.418" offset="4605713">All issues were debated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.293" offset="4609161">And at the conclusion, the trial court determined that certainly no starkness existed on which to place a badge of slavery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.836" offset="4651375">He determined that on the record before him, the proof adduced in that case did not rise to the level of proving that there was any discriminatory intent on the part of the City of Memphis, in placing this barrier at West Drive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1187.375" offset="4897553">Since that time, and in the past decade or so, younger people and young middle-aged people have moved into this neighborhood, have reclaimed these old houses, and have started to repair them and fix them up and turn them into a better neighborhood.</text>

            <text syncTime="1222.502" offset="5037987">All of a sudden, there were a lot of them around.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.876" offset="5051571">And I think this created a very real concern for the citizens in Hein Park, and they started about 1970 feeling a great concern about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.075" offset="5088352">And they talked to people within the City, they talked to Bob Fosnaugh, who was then the traffic engineer, and they had suggested trying to close off the whole park, to see if they couldn't do something about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.006" offset="5135999">That was obviously rejected as being unreasonable, but a suggestion was made to them at that time that the real culprit in this area was the traffic that was coming through West Drive, that if they could somehow shut off that major... what had become a country lane into a major thoroughfare through a very small, quiet residential area, if they could protect that neighborhood they could protect those children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.122" offset="5240489">And this suggestion, really, of just stopping traffic at that one point came originally from someone within the City saying, that's something you might point toward.</text>

            <text syncTime="1320.744" offset="5430974">So there is a mixture, certainly, of white and black traffic through there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.179" offset="5448737">But the court found that the impact would be more on black citizens than on white citizens, so I'm stuck with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1362.118" offset="5596485">We believe that 1982 does and should require a finding of racial motivation and intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.926" offset="5643715">The decisions of this Court would indicate that is a path which this Court would have us follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.156" offset="5676629">Going back to the dicta in Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer, talking about all racially motivated conduct, and following the line of cases of this Court, in Washington v. Davis, in Arlington Heights, and in Personnel Administrator v. Feeney, the path which this Court has indicated to us is that racially motivated, racial intent should be a requirement under 1982.</text>

            <text syncTime="1844.142" offset="7524636">They found, first of all, that Hein Park was a community that was developed in 1940 for exclusively white and the character of that community remained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.731" offset="7570925">They found, the district court also found that the area to the north, the Vollintine and Evergreen area, was predominantly black.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.412" offset="7633618">The district court found... the following facts and sequence of events.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.065" offset="7672280">On or around 1970 the residents in Hein Park filed application with the city to get the street closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.436" offset="7717733">That application was summarily denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.060" offset="7732257">Another application was filed in '72; that was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.525" offset="7762141">And I think the City planner did tell them that instead of trying to close all of the street, they should close the street here, and pursue it at Jackson Avenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.644" offset="7822641">And I must add that Springdale is the logical extension of West Drive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.158" offset="7848658">So they closed... there was a Planning Commission hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.076" offset="7880319">Now, let me explain to the Court here, that at the Planning Commission hearing no one received notice other than the residents of Hein Park.</text>

            <text syncTime="1957.114" offset="7976450">We do also know that the application for the closure was filed in July, I think July 9, 1973, and the Planning Commission decided on November 3, 1973, to recommend closure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2369.854" offset="9627388">I think the unique fact here justifies the relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.040" offset="9644211">I start off by saying that in your decision, Richards, Arlington County v. Richards, if we could start off on that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.659" offset="9694680">Now, that was a case in Arlington where they were talking about off-street parking by I guess residents here, commuters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.892" offset="9727594">But in that particular case, it was significantly different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.640" offset="9738565">First of all, there was the elaborate hearing procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.200" offset="9756851">There was a statutory scheming that was applied equally to the whole County; pursuant to that claim, that scheme, they came up with a formula, not just one particular area, but they came up with a general formula whereby if a certain amount of cars was in a neighborhood, the city manager would take a survey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.315" offset="9853295">Then those people, in effect would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.706" offset="9862804">And of course we submit in this particular case, we think that's a municipal land use case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.798" offset="9891225">Again, I think it's a disputed matter, that this is not a traditional land use case, for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.967" offset="9919855">First of all, there's testimony in the record from the City Planner, Mr. Miller, that the reason why the City didn't use... well, usually land-use matter zoning, they use an ordinance, and of course that takes public hearings, notice, an elaborate scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.271" offset="10005119">What happened in this particular case was basically, somebody decided to accomplish indirectly what they couldn't accomplish directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.360" offset="10041481">They had a hearing before the public, the Planning Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.842" offset="10071365">Thereafter they had a City Council hearing when no notice was given out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.215" offset="10096861">Well, the record indicates that Ms. Terry, who was a white landowner here that objected, was given written notice of the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.616" offset="10134477">People showed up at the hearing, the allotted 15 minutes to the pros and cons, and then voted on it, on the closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.300" offset="10177214">Now, after they voted on the closing, there was another hearing that was held to reconsider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.203" offset="10208874">There was... it is a part of the record, in that particular hearing there was some question as to whether or not there was a serious procedural due process problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.824" offset="10251297">So they decided to vote, not rule on it, on the reconsideration then; they took it over to another, to the 26th, that's in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="3305.012" offset="13368018">I think that, and I started off by saying, I think this is a very bad case to deal with the question of intent because the record clearly shows all kinds of irregularities, violations, and departure from normal procedure, and I think on the evidence credited to the district court, that we prevail on the issue of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.233" offset="13492988">He made findings of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3352.682" offset="13558712">There was also additional evidence to show that they wanted to cut out the undesirable element, there were alternative routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.255" offset="13601031">For an example, why, if you want to stop the traffic, why not close the street at the southern end?</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.938" offset="13631751">Or why not put speed breakers?</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.703" offset="13642827">Or... and this is also, he found this, that historically this neighborhood is the only area that is without sidewalks, so if you're talking about safety of the children, and there is a law in the City that basically says, sidewalks are a prerogative, that you consider a sidewalk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.835" offset="13747316">Schools, public playground, and parks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.910" offset="13763617">Now, all of these areas, all the black area is sidewalked, but West Hein Park historically has never had sidewalks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.735" offset="13798934">So if you're thinking about, if you're talking about safety of the children, why not erect sidewalks?</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.982" offset="13819937">They didn't consider that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.732" offset="13826938">We talked about putting speed breakers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.403" offset="13837596">They wouldn't consider that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.136" offset="13844596">One Council member said that, when the compromise was being worked out, she said, in essence, anything other than a complete closure, we were not going to settle for.</text>
