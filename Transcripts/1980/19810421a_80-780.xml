            <text syncTime="52.533" offset="339897">The issue in this case is whether meals and lodging furnished without charge to employees solely for the convenience of the employer are wages subject to social security, that is, FICA and FUTA taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.194" offset="406457">The court below said yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.429" offset="415443">We think that in light of this Court's decision in Central Illinois Public Service Company in 1978, emphasizing that wages is a narrowly defined term, much narrower than income, the legislative history of social security and income tax withholding indicating that Congress intended that the same wage base, the same exact tax base of wages with the same definition, be used for all employment tax purposes, and the 60-year history of rulings, regulations, and cases that meals and lodging for the convenience of the employer are not income, the answer is clearly that they are not subject to tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="202.097" offset="938101">And as a result, therefore, they were kept aboard for 12-hour shifts for ten days and then every five days a crew went ashore and for five days off when a new crew came aboard.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.491" offset="1419695">Now, no meals or lodging were provided to the crew members during their off duty days and they had to obtain meals and lodging, and maintain regular lodging ashore for their use during the five days they were off duty at their own expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.869" offset="1485210">And the Court should know that in addition to the offshore rigs, the petitioner also operated land based rigs.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.906" offset="1513317">Land-based crews were paid substantially the same cash wages as the offshore crews but the land based crews went home every night and they were not furnished any meals or lodging at the petitioner's expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.199" offset="1570473">Now, the Government admits that the meals and lodging were provided as a result of a unilateral decision by petitioner based on its own economic reasons and that since they were furnished for the convenience of the taxpayer as an employer, they are not wages subject to income tax withholding.</text>

            <text syncTime="452.026" offset="1937859">However, they were not subject to withholding tax, simply because they were not wages, and income tax withholding is imposed on wages, which as this Court pointed out in that case is a much narrower term than income.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.166" offset="1986343">Now, aside from income tax withholding, the other three employment taxes are an employee income tax under the Social Security Act or FICA, which is also subject to withholding; an excise tax on employers under the Social Security Act or FICA, in the identical amount; and Federal Unemployment Insurance Tax on employers or FUTA.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.518" offset="2087802">Now, all four of these taxes, the income tax withholding and the three social security taxes, are imposed on wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.288" offset="2118836">And as acknowledged by the court below and by the Government, wages are defined for all four employment tax purposes in essentially identical terms, as all remuneration for services or employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="572.872" offset="2421229">--Yes, sir, it is common, and the Service has ruled that the employer can do so without that additional tax being counted as wages as a part of the tax base.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.062" offset="2465951">Now, as I previously indicated, for 62 years meals and lodging furnished employees for the convenience of the employer have been recognized as not being remuneration for services, and therefore not income for income tax purposes, even though the revenue acts from 1918 on repeatedly defined income as including wages of whatever kind and in whatever form paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.080" offset="2578068">Thus, although the Government in its briefs only talks about codification of the convenience of the employer rule in 1954, in Section 119, it was well understood that wages did not include meals and lodging for the convenience of the employer when the social security taxes were enacted in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.312" offset="2662914">And the reason, as pointed out by this Court in reviewing the cases and rulings in Kowalski four years ago, is that such items simply are not compensation for services and hence not income.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.986" offset="2713696">Income tax withholding came in in 1942, requiring employers to withhold income tax on wages paid their employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.059" offset="2745984">The Service almost immediately issued Regulation 115 which, if I may quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="660.046" offset="2769912">"provides that if living quarters or meals are furnished to an employee for the convenience of the employer, the value thereof need not be included as wages subject to withholding. "</text>
            <text syncTime="670.585" offset="2812021">Now, this contemporaneous interpretation of the income tax withholding statute is highly significant because this was long before codification of the convenience rule in Section 119 and it's significant because of the legislative history of the income tax withholding, in which Congress expressed a clear and specific intent to adopt as a definitional base for income tax withholding exactly the identical base previously adopted for social security taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.938" offset="2933438">Then still later, in 1978, when Section 119 was amended by Congress to make the exclusion apply to meals furnished for the convenience of the employer, although the employer imposes a partial charge, Senator Long, Chairman of the Finance Committee and manager of the bill on the floor of the Senate, stated on the Senate floor that it was expected that</text>
            <text syncTime="721.870" offset="3017239">"an item excluded from gross income under the convenience of employer test will also be excluded from the definition of wages for all payroll tax purposes, specifically including income tax withholding, social security or FICA, and FUTA tax. "</text>
            <text syncTime="740.282" offset="3090800">In Central Illinois, this Court found that even though lunch payments received by employees were subject to income tax in their hands, they simply were not wages subject to income tax withholding.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.941" offset="3149523">The Government had contended there, as it contends here, that since the payments at issue were part of the employment relationship and a part of the total of the personal benefits that arose out of that relationship, they necessarily constituted wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.784" offset="3212844">This Court, however, rejected what it described as</text>
            <text syncTime="774.203" offset="3226532">"such an expansive and sweeping definition of wages. "</text>
            <text syncTime="778.507" offset="3243773">finding such contention to be inconsistent with the congressional purpose of setting forth a standard that is wages, which the Court described as being intentionally narrow and precise.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.630" offset="3292256">The Court emphasized that the base is limited to wages and that such term is limited by statute in the case of income tax withholding to mean</text>
            <text syncTime="800.353" offset="3331126">"all remuneration for services performed by an employee for his employer. "</text>
            <text syncTime="805.690" offset="3352442">essentially, the identical words of the FICA and FUTA tax statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.292" offset="3370832">The Court also emphasized that the term "wages" makes the tax base much narrower than subjectability to income taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.284" offset="3414823">Now, it's true the Government has cited some authority for contrary conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.204" offset="3434571">Although the 9th Circuit in Pacific American Fisheries in 1943, long before Central Illinois was decided by this case, suggested... and it's only a suggestion... that the convenience of the employer test might be inapplicable for social security tax purposes, and such suggestion was later cited by approval by a district court in the Kresge cases and by another district court in the Goldsboro case.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.803" offset="3528926">Such statements are all dicta in those cases because in every single one of those cases, Pacific American Fisheries, Kresge, and Goldsboro, it was found that the meals or lodging involved were not furnished as a convenience to the employer, as has been conceded here.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.931" offset="3601441">Now, the Government has not been wholly consistent in its position on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.834" offset="3621086">Immediately after the social security tax was enacted in 1935, the Service in 1936 issued Regulation 90, specifically adopting the convenience of the employer test for FUTA tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.261" offset="3682735">And in 1937 the Service repeated that position in Social Security Tax Ruling 110 and interestingly enough, citing there as authority for its position that meals and lodging for the convenience of the employer were not subject to social security tax, its previous income tax ruling in 1920 to the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.841" offset="3765072">Now the Government makes essentially four arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.043" offset="3781895">It points out that it revised its regulations in 1940 to exclude mention of the convenience of employer test.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.565" offset="3811988">And it claims that such regulations were issued pursuant to specific grant of statutory authority to the Social Security Board and the Treasury, and notes that such regulations, it says, have been in effect for 40 years and that the underlying purpose of social security justifies a different result for income tax and social security tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.431" offset="3907492">But we submit that the Government is simply wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.150" offset="3922330">There is no specific statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.184" offset="3934450">The only authority to issue a regulation cited by the Government is in Internal Revenue Code Section 7805(a) authorizing the issuance of interpretive and procedural regulations for the entire Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.844" offset="3989099">And as Professor Davis has pointed out in his treatise on administrative law at Section 503, nearly all Treasury regulations are interpretative and not legislative regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.819" offset="4041030">I beg your pardon?</text>

            <text syncTime="981.890" offset="4057226">This Court in 1945, in overturning an administrative determination as to whether certain payments were wages for social security purposes, under the very identical language and under the very identical act as is involved here, said,</text>
            <text syncTime="996.063" offset="4113964">"Congress might have delegated to the Social Security Board to determine what compensation paid should be treated as wages. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.753" offset="4144684">"Congress did neither. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.688" offset="4152416">Congress used a well understood word, the Court said, wages, to indicate the receipts which were to govern taxes and benefits under the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.827" offset="4193063">Now, in the Royster case, the Government told the 4th Circuit on brief in 1972 that</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.031" offset="4221797">"We agree with the district court's conclusion that the term "wages" has the same meaning for all of the employment taxes involved. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.603" offset="4252099">The Government told the Court of Claims the same thing in the Conquistador case in 1978, when they expected this Court to affirm rather than reverse Central Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.359" offset="4291179">And the 4th Circuit in the Royster case and the 7th Circuit in the recent Oscar Mayer case have all agreed that the term wages has the same essential meaning in the income tax withholding FICA and FUTA tax situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.254" offset="4358784">We submit, therefore, that the lower court was wrong and should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1073.213" offset="4422522">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.486" offset="4455646">Like many other tax cases that have come before the Court in recent terms, this case is governed by longstanding Treasury regulations that explicitly support the Internal Revenue Service's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.313" offset="4510921">The regulations in question are set forth in our brief at the Appendix, page 7a.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.852" offset="4545089">They say, in defining wages for both FICA and FUTA purposes... the regulations on this score are identical...</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.042" offset="4593886">"Ordinarily, facilities or privileges such as entertainment, medical services, or so called courtesy discounts, furnished or offered by an employer to his employees generally are not considered as remuneration for employment if such facilities or privileges are of relatively small value and are offered or furnished by the employer merely as a means of promoting the health, good will, contentment, or efficiency of his employees. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.727" offset="4700674">But then, in language that we consider crucial, the regulation goes on to say,</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.779" offset="4720841">"The term "facilities or privileges", however, does not ordinarily include the value of meals or lodging furnished, for example, to restaurant or hotel employees, or to seamen or other employees aboard vessels, since generally these items constitute an appreciable part of the total remuneration of such employees. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.329" offset="4819061">We consider that the language of this regulation, which has been extant since 1940, some 41 years, control this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1247.627" offset="5120201">In 1940, the FICA regulations, and indeed the analog of the social security regulations, never included the convenience of the employer doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1275.612" offset="5232214">And the initial regulation was at variance on FUTA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.949" offset="5261471">The point that we stress is that in 1940 that was corrected and since 1940, for the last 41 years, the regulations have consistently required that meals and lodging be included in the tax base.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.562" offset="5335972">Those regulations, we submit, are consistent with the committee reports which accompanied the enactment of the social security legislation, indicating that wages were to include compensation paid in any form, such as room and board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.457" offset="5407548">And viewed against the background of the way... when social security was enacted in the mid-1930s, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would suggest that many people worked for little more than room and board, and Congress was terribly concerned that those people be covered and that they get benefits consistent with those wages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1398.743" offset="5724674">May I simply suggest, on that four year period from 1936 to 1940, I would suggest that the Court has dealt with a similar problem a few terms ago in the National Muffler Dealers Association case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.402" offset="5783293">Indeed, where the regulations were amended after about eight or nine years from the... I think from 1919 to 1927, the regulations were at variance with the way they were finally recast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.295" offset="5850898">But our point simply is that the regulations now that have been extant for 41 years have been extant during a period in which Congress recodified the tax law in 1954 and there were a number of appellate decisions that upheld the inclusion of meals and lodgings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.159" offset="5926339">And to point simply that the result would be otherwise with respect to income tax purposes, for income tax purposes, or income tax withholding purposes, is really beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.733" offset="5980674">I mean, nobody's quarreling here that these meals and lodging were excludable under 119 and I think, as Mr. Justice Brennan pointed out, the reason they're excluded from income tax withholding is simply they're not subject to income tax, so why should they be subject to income tax withholding?</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.145" offset="6054339">The court of appeals here, below, said the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.515" offset="6067819">A rationale is not difficult to surmise, because income tax withholding is to set aside amounts to pay the recipient's income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.787" offset="6108883">There isn't any income tax due on this by operation of statute, Section 119, which the Court dealt with a few terms ago in the Kowalski case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1551.824" offset="6336984">And we submit that the court of appeals below here correctly found that that question in that case does not bear on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.930" offset="6373451">As the Court will recall, the issue before the court there was reimbursements for noon meals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.453" offset="6407515">And we argued that those reimbursements were subject to income tax withholding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.809" offset="6436981">The Court's opinion in that case stressed heavily the fact that the employer in that case in 1963 could not reasonably have been held to be aware of the fact that it was required to withhold on such meal reimbursements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.155" offset="6522349">And because of that so called unfair notice or lack of notice, the Court was unwilling to impose secondary tax liability on the employer in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.130" offset="6574281">If I may just read a few excerpts from the Court's opinion, where the Court says at page 32,</text>

            <text syncTime="1652.290" offset="6738852">There can be no question that since 1940 employers were on notice, employers like Rowan Company, that they were required to include meals and lodging in FICA and FUTA, whatever the income tax or the income tax withholding situation might have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.084" offset="6818055">Indeed, the Service in the 1940s was publishing rulings which we cite in our brief that the result would be different under income tax withholding.</text>
