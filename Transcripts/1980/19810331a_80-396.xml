            <text syncTime="45.217" offset="325057">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="47.653" offset="334879">We are here this afternoon to decide whether municipal governments all across this nation are going to be subjected to a new and potentially ruinous form of damage assessment, a form of damage assessment that clearly was never contemplated by the 42nd Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.003" offset="428293">It clearly is founded in no strong policy purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.626" offset="446788">And it wholly fails to accomplish any of the remedial purposes of Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.685" offset="478971">An award of punitive damages against a municipality lacks either a historic or a societal justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.712" offset="527036">Now, an affirmative answer to the question presented... that is to say, is a municipality liable for punitive damages in a 1983 case... an affirmative answer to that question, it seems to me, will wreak havoc with the balance of governmental powers in the United States without producing any significant corresponding social purpose, even aside from the questions of division of governmental powers, what logic or reason supports a damage structure which punishes the innocent without deterring the guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.927" offset="719924">Now, going to the historic background of 1983, it is perfectly clear that punitive damage awards against municipalities were wholly beyond the ken of the 42nd Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.968" offset="780110">Up until 1871 no court in this country, with one exception... and that exception was clearly remedied very shortly thereafter... no court of the United States had ever upheld a punitive damage award against a municipality.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.179" offset="860986">And the lawyer members of the 42nd Congress couldn't have helped but know that.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.880" offset="883764">There was a plethora of authority on that subject at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.487" offset="898184">As a matter of fact, none of the courts of England had ever upheld a punitive damages award against a municipality.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.310" offset="941443">If one wants to look at legislative history as this Court has done in considering the question of compensatory awards against municipalities, one only has to look at the remarks of Congressman Kerr, Congressman Butler, and Congressman Poland.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.036" offset="1024408">Now, admittedly, those remarks were directed to debate on the Sherman Amendment, but we must remember that the Sherman Amendment was aimed directly at municipalities, the Sherman Act which passed the Senate and died in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.343" offset="1089609">And each of those gentlemen speaking to the question of the impact of the Sherman Act indicated that it was intended, and they believed it was intended, to be entirely remedial.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.290" offset="1145407">I believe Representative Blair said, it is not punitive or penal but remedial only.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.895" offset="1183859">And I believe that one can read that as representing the thinking of even some of the most radical members of the 42nd Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.437" offset="1225968">I suggest that a punitive award would have been totally abhorrent.</text>

            <label>Mr. Guy J. Wells</label>
            <text syncTime="325.089" offset="1444561">I believe Representative Butler was.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.572" offset="1454488">I think perhaps Representative Kerr was an opponent.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.197" offset="1461070">But it's interesting that they were in complete agreement with respect to the import of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.445" offset="1493985">And of course the Sherman Act was a precursor of 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.880" offset="1511748">Now, the reasons why I think that a punitive award against the city was abhorrent to Congress in 1871, the reasons for that are as compelling today as they were then; even perhaps more compelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.712" offset="1623134">Obviously, an award of punitive damages has an immeasurable impact upon the financial structure of a city and today we have seen, like, for instance, the examples of New York, Cleveland, Boston; we know about them simply because they are matters of national interest and we read about them all the time; but I suggest that they are multiplied a thousandfold in smaller municipalities throughout this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.262" offset="1745283">And one only has to read the briefs, particularly of the Attorney General and the briefs of the National Institute of Municipal Law Officers, to understand the real menace or the real sword of Damocles that is hanging over the heads of our cities and towns.</text>

            <text syncTime="437.826" offset="1895539">If they like them I guess they can take their chances.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.370" offset="1909750">In this case Newport attempted not to take its chances, but beyond that the scope of 1983 is so broad and I'm sure this Court is aware that today 1983 cases are multiplying like rabbits.</text>

            <text syncTime="894.644" offset="3722857">And Judge Pettine reasoned, and I think correctly, if we are to have an award of punitive damages that the city could not be more guilty than the councilmen who actually committed the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.296" offset="3773430">What will happen if we're talking about focusing voter outrage on elected officials, the voter outrage won't be focused, if assessment of taxes is what will do it, and I suggest that that is the only thing that will do it, the voter outrage won't be focused until the assessment which will be by a council at least six years away from the act itself, and they may not be the rascals that need to be turned out at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1705.554" offset="6966429">Mr. Wells' argument is bottomed on the allegation that the innocent taxpayers would be the ones who'll bear the burden of a punitive damage award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.891" offset="7027764">This argument could be made against every provision of 1983: the innocent taxpayers bearing the burden of a compensatory award, or the innocent taxpayers bearing the burden of injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.338" offset="7081577">And I submit to Your Honors that the punitive damage award is the least expensive kind of deterrent that we can buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.818" offset="7127552">In any given case, injunctive relief provided under 1983 will normally be far more expensive than a given punitive damage award.</text>

            <text syncTime="1772.807" offset="7235490">With reference... Mr. Wells was making the argument that the innocent taxpayer carries the burden of the punitive damage award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.351" offset="7265688">That same argument could be made with reference to injunctive relief, or reference to compensatory damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.489" offset="7294213">I submit that the punitive damage award is necessary under 1983, especially since Carey v. Piphus, because of the reason that Mr. Wells and the City of Newport tried to overlook, the deterrence which this Court has acknowledged to be a primary underlying premise of 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.010" offset="7392329">Since Carey v. Piphus, where the courts were struggling to find some grounds in between punitive and compensatory for awarding a substantial sum of money for, I think, what Prosser would refer to as "the petty outrages".</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.330" offset="7469547">And the Court there held there could be nothing more than nominal damages for violation of procedural due process or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.592" offset="7510612">There's a whole spectrum of cases which would support nothing more than nominal damages.</text>
