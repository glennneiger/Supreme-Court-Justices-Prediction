            <text syncTime="51.605" offset="334449">His union took his case through the grievance procedure, all the way to arbitration before a joint panel, regularly constituted, which, under the collective bargaining agreement issues awards which are final and binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.035" offset="404144">Seventeen months later, Mitchell, the Plaintiff, sued United Parcel Service and the union under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, seeking reinstatement and back pay, charging that the union had failed to represent him fairly in the arbitration proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.103" offset="504454">Both parties moved to dismiss, the District Court did dismiss, the Court of Appeals reversed, and held unlike the District Court which says that a statute of limitations of 90 days which applied to actions to vacate arbitration awards, does not apply... but rather, the regular statute of limitations applying to contract claims did apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="235.327" offset="1069326">While the petition was pending the Third Circuit decided the Liotta case, which was really on all fours with what the District Court did... held that a 90 day statute in these very facts would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.977" offset="1143932">The case has very real significance, very important significance in labor management relations throughout the United States and the potential impact may best be seen, perhaps by the fact that the International Brotherhood of Teamsters with its almost two million members and its 80 to 100 thousand collective bargaining agreements, has filed a brief amicus curiae and that the AFL-CIO with its 15 and 1/2 million members has likewise filed a brief, taking very strong positions.</text>

            <text syncTime="429.185" offset="1844745">But I might say that no statute of limitations was involved in the Hines case, and I think anyone who reads the case would feel that if there were a statute it would have been tolled by virtue of the really monstrous facts there: an employee having been found guilty, when two years later a clerk in a motel admitted that he had stolen the money and not the employee.</text>

I substituted the words discharged employee... the effect of a judgment for the discharged employee would be to nullify the arbitral decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.427" offset="3317738">That's the precise language quoted by both those courts; the only two that have opted for a longer statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.285" offset="3349189">I think where the Court of Appeals went wrong was in focussing on the underlying claim rather than the relief sought, and said the underlying claim is the collective bargaining agreement.</text>

I started to say, about the substantive claim... the reason I believe that that's a flaw in the reasoning of the Court is that every arbitration has an underlying claim and if you're not going to worry about procedure at all and you're going to look at the underlying claim, then there is no arbitration really, involving an employee that doesn't have an underlying claim of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.989" offset="4104023">So all these decisions would have to be no-no.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.550" offset="4118234">They now go to the contract 5 or 6 years, in virtually all the states, and the fact that there was an arbitration is just washed out.</text>

            <text syncTime="1240.796" offset="5091243">It would mean that when you sit down to negotiate a contract out there, forget discharges... you have serious arbitrations on seniority rights, what are the seniority rights... on meanings of clauses, this point is made very well in the Teamster's brief, and likewise in the AFL-CIO brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1414.929" offset="5787772">It has this fact I just mentioned, the lack of standing which is certainly erroneous, it has that this would be basically unfair and what it's saying is that the policy of labor management relations in America is basically unfair, that what unions and management want is basically unfair.</text>

          <turn speaker="david_jaroslawicz" startTime="2271.629" stopTime="2468.644">
            <label>Mr. David Jaroslawicz</label>
            <text syncTime="2271.629" offset="9214515">I believe Justice Timbers took that from this Court's decision in Hoosier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.190" offset="9228830">Where this Court in Hoosier, said that six years was relatively rapid and in that case, admittedly, the Court was choosing between a 20 year statute and a six year statute, and so the Court indicated that six years was relatively rapid and sufficient to meet labor policy and that's where I believe Judge Timbers adopted that from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.229" offset="9312944">And the reason I say to the Court that it can't be a motion to vacate an arbitration award, is that nobody even in this Court, argues that the Plaintiff's remedy or the employee's remedy is to go back and have a new arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.849" offset="9375429">If this were truly an attempt to vacate an arbitration award, as it is where there's corruption of an arbitrator, the employee's remedy is to go back to a new arbitrator where there won't be corruption and he'll have a fair opportunity to be heard before the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.419" offset="9437705">But that is not a section 301 claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.935" offset="9447736">A section 301 claim is a separate claim, which the statute and Congress has given an employee, it says if you didn't have a fair hearing and the union sold you out, whether it's arbitration or anything else, you have a right to be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.772" offset="9511161">And that's what Vaca said and that's what Hines said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.239" offset="9524954">I think it's also interesting to see that the union in this case, in filing of a brief, said we should have the same statute of limitations as the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.031" offset="9568108">The employer, in its reply brief said, we don't want the same statute of limitations as the union, we get a different statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.888" offset="9603530">I believe the reason for that is that the union clearly knows that it cannot possibly argue that the statute of limitations as against the union is 90 days to vacate an arbitration award because there is no arbitration award to be vacated against the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.802" offset="9679285">While the employer has a superficially appealing argument, it says you're really trying to vacate an arbitration award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.720" offset="9710946">But that's not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.813" offset="9715334">The arbitration was between the union and the employer, the employee's right may have been at stake, but he never had a chance to be heard and his rights weren't adjudicated, if not, he would never get to the section 301 claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.370" offset="9773535">And I say that if the union or the employer wanted to bypass the arbitration award or vacate it, if you will, here the statute of limitations is 90 days, because that's the agreement between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.302" offset="9837274">But when it comes to the employee, it's not 90 days, and under the standing issue, which I think the Second Circuit probably recognized, he would have no standing in the State of New York to even bring the proceeding, the New York Court of Appeals has said if you're unhappy with what your union did, you bring a separate action, a 301 action, against your union, but you can't interfere in the arbitration, which is a proceeding between the union and the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.570" offset="9962348">That, Your Honor, is basically Mitchell's position.</text>
