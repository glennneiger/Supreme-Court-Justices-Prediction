            <text syncTime="75.614" offset="448345">There may have been some doubt about the standing of the previous case before the Court, but I can assure you that the case now before you is certainly worthy of your consideration; it has been a long time coming.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.824" offset="505188">In federal criminal cases, voir dire is seriously sick if unfettered judicial discretion may preclude any inquiry as to racial prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.766" offset="557015">Before this Court is both a constitutional question, we would contend, under the Amendment, the right to an impartial jury in the language of course, of Ham and Ristaino.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.456" offset="603722">But more importantly is the supervisory power... and I'm directing your attention, of course, to the opinion of Chief Justice Hughes in the Aldridge case.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.662" offset="640502">Unfortunately, in federal courts there has been caught up this sense of expeditious resolve of voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.251" offset="674879">It has become sometimes perfunctory, some have called it... commentators, even those working for the federal judicial center, calling it "routinized ritual".</text>
            <text syncTime="143.793" offset="721064">It is unfortunate, because it has strayed a long way from its original beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.177" offset="742589">And of course, some of that must be laid to rest at the feet of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.398" offset="759516">The old days, and I think in this Court's opinion in Swain, there was reference to protracted voir dire that might exist in the state court system, but certainly not in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.437" offset="799640">My district, voir dire sometimes is 10 or 15 minutes; in the instant case it was 6.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.562" offset="1068179">It's a little case but it's got a big issue, concerning federal criminal practice... little case, is an individual by the name of Humberto Rosales-Lopez, who's charged with alien smuggling, one of about six or seven, unfortunately he exercised his right to trial by jury and had that right accorded to him and was sentenced to 18 months confinement followed by a 30-year suspended sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="281.247" offset="1270889">And the other defendants in the case split up, the worst one did 90 days time, of all people, they didn't exercise the right to trial by jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2126.673" offset="8652571">This Court's cases don't suggest that questions about racial bias or racial prejudice, need to be put in any particular form, in Ham this Court specifically disclaimed any intention... to impose such a requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.249" offset="8706905">The Court's questions in this case were more than adequate to satisfy both the constitutional rule and the federal common law rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.521" offset="8743999">A panel of jurors drawn from the Southern District of California could hardly have failed to understand the trial judge's questions to include bias against Mexican aliens and any strong feelings they might have had about the illegal alien problem, illegal Mexican alien problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.018" offset="8826024">The only bias that wasn't covered by the questions the trial court asked, only conceivable bias that wasn't covered is bias against Americans with Mexican ancestry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.557" offset="8868133">Petitioner of course, was not an American, and there's no reason at all to assume that the jurors in this case would have been biased against Mexican Americans but not Mexican aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.198" offset="8914736">Throughout the proceedings in the Courts below, the Petitioner... and in fact, in this Court as well... Petitioner argues that the trial court was obliged to ask this additional question only because this Court's decisions required it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.345" offset="8991327">Neither Ham nor Aldridge nor any other decision of this Court purported to establish a per se rule to be applied without regard to the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.901" offset="9033541">Ristaino, of course, makes it plain that the constitutional rule is... the constitutional rule is triggered only if race or racial bias is inextricably bound up with the issues at trial, that simply wasn't the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.061" offset="9094145">The federal common law rule announced in Aldridge requires the questions specifically directed to racial bias or at least something more than a general question only when the nature of the offense or the facts of the case suggest that there is a strong or substantial likelihood that racial bias will affect the jury's deliberations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.711" offset="9196754">The decision in Aldridge does not rest on the assumption that only a question specifically mentioning race is sufficient to uncover racial bias, nor does it rest on the assumption that a question that does not mention race is necessarily insufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="2318.798" offset="9421093">And there was particularly nothing wrong with asking the question in light of the questions that were asked, but in addition to that, the federal common law rule that Petitioner relies on does not at all suggest that the question should be asked whenever the Defendant requests it, but only when the likelihood that racial bias will affect the jury's deliberations is substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.532" offset="9527986">In Ristaino, this Court made it fairly clear that something more than a general question was required, but the rule is only required because the facts indicate a need for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2386.859" offset="9693289">As I said, the federal common law rule adopted in Aldridge, or announced in Aldridge, only requires a question more specific than a general question when the facts or the circumstances surrounding the case suggest there is some particularly substantial likelihood that racial bias will be a factor in the case or influence the jury's deliberations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.141" offset="9782419">There's simply... in both Ristaino and Aldridge, black defendants were charged with crimes of violence directed at white law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.765" offset="9832992">In Aldridge the defendant was charged with murder, and in Ristaino, assault with intent to murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.586" offset="9852218">In cases involving crimes of interracial violence, the danger that racial prejudice will affect the deliberations of the jury, is particularly substantial for some of the jurors are likely to identify with the victim and view the case as us against them, and of course, crimes of violence are inherently more likely to evoke strong emotional reactions in jurors than most nonviolent crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.486" offset="9967888">The Petitioner's attempt in this Court and in his brief to rely on the relationship with Bowling's daughter, is... well, comes about three years too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.194" offset="10014700">In the District Court, Petitioner said nothing, absolutely nothing to the District judge about the possibility that this relationship with Bowling's daughter would be mentioned at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.821" offset="10069139">And as Justice Marshall pointed out, it's the duty of counsel to point out the facts which will support a request for a specific question.</text>
