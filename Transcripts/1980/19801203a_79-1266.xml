            <text syncTime="74.986" offset="436389">The issue presented in this case is whether the Securities and Exchange Commission should be required to apply a clear and convincing standard of proof, rather than a preponderance of evidence standard, in its disciplinary proceedings alleging violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.584" offset="554776">The Petitioner, Mr. Charles Steadman, is the president, chairman of the board and sole beneficial owner of the voting stock of Steadman Security Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.046" offset="616634">That company is registered with the SEC as investment advisor, advisors and managements, a number of mutual funds called the Steadman Funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.071" offset="668774">More than 10 years ago, the SEC commenced a proceeding against Mr. Steadman and SSC, and over the objections of the Petitioner, it applied a preponderance of the evidence standard, defined violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.265" offset="765532">On the basis of those violations the SEC imposed the most extreme sanctions at its disposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.511" offset="810462">Those sanctions would bar Mr. Steadman from association with any investment advisor.</text>

            <text syncTime="189.487" offset="894367">Mr. Justice Blackmun, the sanctions related not only to a bar on association with an investment advisor, they went on to bar Mr. Steadman from association or affiliation with a registered investment company, would suspend him from any association with a broker-dealer for one year.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.941" offset="1036265">It is not irrelevant, because one gets into gradations of relevant factors dictating what standard of proof should be applied, and it will be our argument that when one has in this case, a combination of important factors such as the extreme sanctions and such as the allegations of fraud, that that is a much easier case for this Court to impose a clear and convincing standard of proof.</text>

            <label>Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="299.130" offset="1333016">Certainly one of the reasons, as I have understood it, that in a criminal case the proof must be beyond a reasonable doubt, is the fact that the sanction upon conviction can be loss of personal liberty and confinement in an institution, and in some extreme cases, death.</text>

            <text syncTime="323.198" offset="1429251">If one does not stand with that proposition, one gets into the problem the D.C. Circuit was confronted with, after it issued its decision in Collins v. SEC, in which it said we want a clear and convincing standard of proof, and the SEC the next time around, in a case involving Whitney, said well, in this case we're only imposing a nine-month suspension on a broker-dealer, and so in this case, since the sanction is less than we imposed in Collins, we'll apply a preponderance of the evidence standard.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter J. Nickles</label>
            <text syncTime="367.649" offset="1607092">--I believe, Your Honor, that the authorization to impose extreme sanctions is the triggering device to impose a higher standard of proof, but I am also saying the fact that the SEC imposed extreme sanctions is relevant in this context for the Court to understand the nature of the damage to reputation and profession that can be imposed by the SEC, on the basis of the lowest standard of proof known to the judicial system, preponderance of evidence standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.591" offset="1730808">I might also add that the net effect of the order of the SEC that was recognized by the SEC, is to force a sale by Mr. Steadman of his multi-million dollar enterprise, Steadman Security Corporation, in effect a distress sale, and the SEC provided a 90-day period in which to sell the assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.176" offset="1817117">So you have not only a bar, but you have a distress sale of the assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.315" offset="1841672">Now when the case went up on appeal to the Fifth Circuit--</text>

            <label>Justice Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="429.876" offset="1855987">Mr. Nickles, I take it you feel that the... in this case and on the facts of this case, a different standard would have led to a different result?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_j_nickles" startTime="437.607" stopTime="809.957">
            <label>Mr. Peter J. Nickles</label>
            <text syncTime="437.607" offset="1886916">--Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.528" offset="1890573">Your Honor, and the reason we say that, and I'll get into that in more detail, when the case went up to the Fifth Circuit, the Fifth Circuit said there's no question that but under Section 17(a)(1) of the 1933 Act, scienter is required, and they said the SEC made a finding of intent to deceive.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.878" offset="1983987">But what do we have in the findings of the SEC to sustain that finding?</text>
            <text syncTime="469.703" offset="2015230">All we have is the mere existence of the fact that Steadman and SSC had loans outstanding to certain banks of national reputation that held the custodianship of these funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.212" offset="2073326">And the Fifth Circuit puzzled and said, why didn't the SEC make a finding that Mr. Steadman or SSC had intentionally offered the custodianship of these funds to the bank in exchange for the loans?</text>
            <text syncTime="500.487" offset="2138423">And interestingly, they dropped a footnote, which relates to another point, and the footnote said the reason presumably why the SEC did not make those findings is because all of the evidence was to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.155" offset="2197042">All of the bank officials that were put on the stand, testified that in every case the loans were made solely on the basis of the borrower's ability to repay at normal competitive interest rates and that there was in fact, no connection, no connection between the loans and the custodianships.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.787" offset="2279589">But the SEC said, that doesn't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.409" offset="2294113">What matters is that there is a potential for conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.423" offset="2314175">What matters is that Mr. Steadman potentially might keep excess amounts of the Fund's assets in non-interest bearing checking accounts and what matters is that he did not disclose that potential conflict of interest over a period of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.775" offset="2387527">But I observe to the Court that at no time did the SEC even charge Mr. Steadman with keeping excess amounts of funds in non-interest bearing checking accounts and indeed, there was no finding and indeed, the finding was to the effect that the funds benefitted to a tune of several hundreds of thousands of dollars by reason of the transfer of the custodianships of these banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.044" offset="2508630">So there was no benefit, as such, to Mr. Steadman, there was no harm to the funds, and on that basis, the Fifth Circuit said, we see little basis for a finding of intentional misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.116" offset="2568921">The point I make to the Court is that on that basis, that the mere existence at the same time of the loan relationship and the custodian relationship, the SEC found Mr. Steadman guilty of intentional misconduct, stigmatized Mr. Steadman, deprived him of his livelihood, and forced a distress sale of Steadman Security Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.602" offset="2698906">It is on the basis, I submit, of the collateral banking relationships, that this sanction was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.771" offset="2731507">There are other matters, but I submit to the Court, that with respect to the advisory fee issue, a tender solicitation fee issue, each of those items was performed on the advice of counsel and with the assent and knowledge of the fund directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.827" offset="2803710">Now what did the Fifth Circuit say?</text>
            <text syncTime="669.077" offset="2812800">The Fifth Circuit said yes, we recognize that these sanctions are extraordinary.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.338" offset="2841848">They said, we recognize that the sanctions are equivalent to disbarment.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.445" offset="2866194">We recognize that in disbarment proceedings, clear and convincing evidence may be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.475" offset="2890332">We recognize that in civil cases alleging fraud, clear and convincing evidence may be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.988" offset="2920425">We recognize that the D.C. Circuit held in the Collins case, that clear and convincing proof is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.125" offset="2944980">But we can protect Petitioners like Mr. Steadman by reviewing findings of violation pursuant to the arbitrary and capricious standard, of the Administrative Procedure Act and in particular, we can review the sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.226" offset="3017391">But what is the standard of review for imposition of sanctions by administrative agencies?</text>
            <text syncTime="727.709" offset="3047275">Very narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.426" offset="3054172">Fifth Circuit recognized that the standard of review is to show that such sanctions are without justification in law, or in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.625" offset="3102968">But the Fifth Circuit so recognized that these sanctions were extreme, that they held as a matter of law that in the context of this case, to show that sanctions would not be without justification in fact a compelling reason showing must be submitted by the SEC on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.817" offset="3207667">Now our argument in support of the clear and convincing standard of proof is threefold.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.158" offset="3237133">And we have all three factors present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.735" offset="3251344">We have first, not only the authorization to impose extreme sanctions but the fact that they are imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.418" offset="3290110">We have second allegations of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.525" offset="3310590">And we have third the very substantial, institutional and procedural advantages that are accorded the SEC in its administrative proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1886.962" offset="7684323">The federal securities laws do provide a scope of review provision; Section 25(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 is typical and it provides that any person who is aggrieved by an order of the Commission may appeal that order to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.704" offset="7767288">Section 25(a) goes on to provide that the Commission's findings of fact shall be supported if... or should be affirmed if supported by substantial evidence in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.215" offset="7809293">Beyond that, the APA governs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.307" offset="7829669">As we know, the APA clearly covers all aspects of Commission adjudicatory proceedings unless the Federal Securities laws displace it in some respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.133" offset="7861016">The scheme of the Federal Securities legislation though, is such that the APA substantially governs these proceedings including Section 7(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.596" offset="7910857">That section specifically provides that no sanction may be imposed except in accordance with reliable, probative and substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.450" offset="7950250">It says it very clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.324" offset="7961744">What does the language mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.684" offset="7971148">The House Report, underlying the bill that became the Administrative Procedure Act, and that inserted the critical language to that Section 7(c), the words 7(c) as a standard of proof to be applied in administrative adjudicatory proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.611" offset="8074906">Mr. Justice Clark, who at the time of the passage of the Administrative Procedure Act, was attorney general, in his dissenting opinion in the Woodby case, noted that language in the Immigration and Nationality Act which was similar to the APA should be construed as the APA language had always been construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.274" offset="8157558">And that is that the language "reliable, probative and substantial" is a standard of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.006" offset="8184516">The majority in Woodby did not agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.879" offset="8196010">Curiously, the D.C. Court of Appeals, the very court that has decided the Collins and Woodby cases, and the Sea Island case, which was a case involving the Federal Communication Commission, where the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals applied a clear and convincing standard, it too recognized that the language in 7(c) set a preponderance standard of the proof and then completely ignored the language and went on to apply the clear and convincing standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.024" offset="8312516">Well, that's why we believe the words of Section 7(c) and the appropriate legislative history supporting those words, confirm that the preponderance of the evidence standard is supported.</text>

            <text syncTime="2219.812" offset="9015732">Because the provisions, the standard of proof and the scope of review provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act apply to all administrative adjudications by the SEC, unless another law applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.696" offset="9071216">And the SEC law, the Federal Securities Laws do not apply, then the APA's application is pervasive and absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.272" offset="9097548">Again, I think you have to look at the APA very carefully to distinguish it from the situation that we had in Woodby.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.284" offset="9133597">Note that the APA beautifully provides, quite separately, for burden of proof which it places on the agency, quality of evidence that is, the admissibility of evidence, it proscribes irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitive evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.947" offset="9212278">It provides separately for standard of proof in the words that I cited to you before, that is, reliable, probative and substantial, and then provides, quite separately again, for scope of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.192" offset="9265254">It talks about substantial evidence for factual findings, and arbitrary, capricious, and other standards for predictive or quasi-legislative judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.767" offset="9303497">Now the Commission's position is that even if this Court disagreed, that the APA didn't by its language, its words, apply to this proceeding, then nonetheless, the Court should defer to the Commission's judgment to apply a standard of proof no greater than preponderance in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2354.569" offset="9554691">Well there's, I think, a reason for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.707" offset="9579246">The reason is that when you look at the words, when the words 7(c), there's a note to the House Report that I recall, that says something to the effect that the additional words "substantial" and "in accordance with" were added for the same reasons that words were added in the preceding footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.965" offset="9660330">And you go and you look at the preceding footnote and you see that what Congress was about in both this part of 7(c) and in the part of 7(c) referred to by the prior note, was conforming the language as best it could, rationalizing the language as best it could, between the standard of proof and scope of review provisions of the APA, so that Courts wouldn't be confused with respect to standards of proof and scope of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.876" offset="9771925">It's interesting how they did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.626" offset="9778926">The scope of review provision of the APA had provided that review should occur on the basis of the entire record of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.105" offset="9816856">The standard of proof, that is, Section 7 of the APA, said nothing about agency de novo review placed on the entire record of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.930" offset="9852173">It was silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.617" offset="9854890">So that Congress added the words based on the entire record of the proceeding to the agency review part of the APA, and it said it did that because some hypertechnical person might believe that if the Congress didn't specify that the agency... by exact words... that the agency should rely on the entire record because it did specify it for the appellate function, agencies might run amuck and not specify it on the entire record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.090" offset="9964813">By similar reasoning, what the Court did when it reached the standard of proof section was to say we'd like to use the same words, the same notions, in the standard of proof section that we used in the scope of review section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.803" offset="10027612">Had the Congress done what you suggested, Mr. Justice Stevens, and that is, say the word preponderance in the standard of proof section, what that would have created in the Congress' mind, and this is what they said their problem was in doing that, is that ambiguity between the standard of proof and scope of review section, the standard of proof section would have said agencies are to decide by a preponderance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.857" offset="10119876">The scope of review section would have said, courts are to review on the basis of substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.449" offset="10142237">And what I think the Congress was worried about, although now I'm getting away from what the actual words of the legislative report say, is that appellate courts would have drawn on the preponderance standard that they would have specifically included in the scope of review provision and made it a scope... I'm sorry, the standard of proof provision, and made it a scope of review provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.567" offset="10210678">And the Congress didn't want that; they wanted substantial evidence to be the exclusive test for judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.611" offset="10246936">Now that's a rather complex answer, but unfortunately what you're tearing at are the tissues of legislative history to understand why Congress very carefully and... in this very carefully honed act... chose the words that it chose to express the meaning that it intended to convey in sorting through these various provisions, that the... I know the Petitioner, in his reply brief, as I recall it, says that the Attorney General's manual, the authoritative guide to the APA, doesn't characterize Section 7(c) as a standard of proof section, but rather characterizes it as a scope of review section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.280" offset="10421538">But what he doesn't include in his reply brief is that the Attorney General's manual was written before the bill was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.465" offset="10446302">And the critical language, the language about... the addition of the language of "in accordance with" and "substantial" was not added until after the Attorney General's report was written.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.259" offset="10481515">And now we have Mr. Justice Clark's dissenting opinion in Woodby where he actually, and I think correctly, characterizes what the meaning of that language is.</text>

            <text syncTime="2610.952" offset="10580258">And certainly it was in the interests of the administration to give as limited as possible a construction to the Act insofar as it would limit agency action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2639.816" offset="10695719">But I think the relevant point is that the silence of the Attorney General's manual on whether 7(c) is a standard of proof provision is easily explained by the fact that the provision didn't exist in its present form at the time the Attorney General's manual was written.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.260" offset="10769489">I'm making there a very small point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.010" offset="10776490">We are not the ones relying on or discrediting the Attorney General's manual for purposes of this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.568" offset="10818704">Then as I said a moment ago, even if the... even if this Court determined that the APA specific language of 7(c) was not applicable here and it did not prescribe a specific standard of proof as we think that it did, we believe that the agency's discretion in utilizing the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof should be respected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.024" offset="10948585">Our position there is that this Court, in the Vermont Yankee case, noted that the Administrative Procedure Act admittedly in a rulemaking proceeding, provided the statutory maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.019" offset="10996545">It provided the essentials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.566" offset="11006681">And then absent constitutional considerations which the Petitioner agrees are not in this case, or other extraordinary or compelling instances, the agency's discretion should be respected in adopting its own internal procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.872" offset="11059971">Regrettably, I think, at times, this Court does not get a good deal of direct feedback on the effect of its decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.259" offset="11105528">But I can assure you that the very commonsense approach that this Court took in Vermont Yankee has saved governmental agencies thousands of hours, if not days or weeks, in conforming with real or imagined procedures engrafted upon the administrative process by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.110" offset="11196852">And I can tell you very clearly that many of us in administrative practice in Washington today believe that this case is to adjudicatory proceedings what Vermont Yankee was to rulemaking proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.900" offset="11252023">Ever since the Collins case, innumerable agency proceedings have been tangled with questions relating to the proper standard of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.569" offset="11286714">That is so, because as this Court knows, venue for reviewing administrative action typically will lie in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.377" offset="11329972">Collins for that reason might as well have been a case decided by this Court for purposes of administrative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.280" offset="11357558">We are all, unless we'd like to buck the D.C. Circuit once again, we are all bound by the Collins result.</text>
