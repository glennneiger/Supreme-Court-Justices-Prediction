            <text syncTime="12.671" offset="142766">This case comes to us by writ of certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.945" offset="171814">It involves the proper measure of compensation for a worker who's covered by the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.194" offset="212774">That Act applies to employers in the District of Columbia by reason of a special act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.767" offset="251121">The employee involved in this case suffered a severe injury to his knee which was classified as a permanent partial disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.489" offset="298037">The statute contains a schedule of compensation to be awarded for various kinds of physical injuries, one of which is the lost of the use of a leg, and under that schedule this employee is entitled to a specific measured compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.258" offset="381107">His injury is just partial.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.576" offset="386331">He re-continues to work but the -- the statutory scheduled compensation is less than he would receive if he brought -- made his claim under a provision that allows compensation for other cases, cases not specifically listed on the -- on the schedule and he sought recovery as -- and other case which would allow him a substantially larger recovery maybe by a percentage of his lost of earnings and the fixed amount pursuant to the schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.015" offset="512137">The Court of Appeals held that he was entitled to this alternative measure of recovery and the question for us to decide was whether that was a proper reading of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.378" offset="553515">As we read the statute, the Congress has provided the other cases to cover those which are not on -- on the list and not as an alternative measure of recovery for those for which is a specific recovery is -- is provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.122" offset="616522">For that reason, although it may well be true that the statute is in need of reexamination because it's a rather old schedule, we have decided to reverse the judgment the Court of Appeals and we explained our reasons in some detail in an opinion filed with the clerk today.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.738" offset="686948">Justice Blackman has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
