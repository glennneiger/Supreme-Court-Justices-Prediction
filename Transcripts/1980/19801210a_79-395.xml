            <text syncTime="14.791" offset="202406">This case presents the question of whether it is proper to dismiss a criminal indictment as a sanction for misconduct by government agents that did not affect the pending criminal prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="42.264" offset="312225">In June, 1978, she was indicted for that offense and for another similar sale that she allegedly made to the same person in May of '77.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.745" offset="346184">The two-count indictment was returned in the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.477" offset="369172">Sometime before she was indicted, Respondent retained her present attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.383" offset="384741">He has continued to represent her throughout these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.834" offset="398534">In August 1978, while Respondent was awaiting trial, she was visited by Agents Stephen Hopson and James Bradley of the Drug Enforcement Administration.</text>

            <text syncTime="187.580" offset="893502">The agent himself said that he couldn't remember whether he had made any specific comments about the judge personally, but that he certainly had told her that she faced a severe sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.702" offset="934044">With respect to any of these discrepancies in the testimony, Mr. Justice Stewart, there is a footnote right at the beginning of the Court of Appeals' opinion, in which the Court says that it decided the case on the basis of the undisputed facts, in addition to any other facts in the record considered most favorably to the government, because the District Court had made no factual finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.740" offset="1026204">So the Court of Appeals would dismiss the indictment even before factual inferences, if you want, for the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.940" offset="1050968">Respondent told Agent Hopson the name of her attorney and Hopson asked her how much she paid him.</text>

            <text syncTime="235.796" offset="1086390">He asked her whether she'd ever seen the attorney's work, and he said that he had seen it in the past and that she should think about the kind of representation she should get for $200.</text>

            <text syncTime="610.385" offset="2584774">She then appealed the denial of her motion to dismiss, in accordance with the agreement; the Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.070" offset="2607448">The Court acknowledged that Respondent did not provide any information to the DEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.490" offset="2629182">The Court said that the importuning of the government agents was unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.237" offset="2648199">The Court didn't suggest that the agents' actions had damaged Respondent's relationship with her attorney in any way, or whether her criminal prosecution had been affected by the agents' visits.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.953" offset="2695010">Nevertheless, the Court held that the indictment should be dismissed because of what the Court called the agents' deliberate attempt to destroy the attorney-client relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.558" offset="2733463">And to subvert the defendant's right to the assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.540" offset="2745374">Now apparently, because Respondent's conviction had not been affected by the agents' conduct, the Court concluded that this dismissal was the only sanction available that would remedy the alleged constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.580" offset="2813502">But we've advanced two alternative arguments that the Court of Appeals decision is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.937" offset="2842968">They are parallel in many respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.094" offset="2847565">First, we've argued that the DEA agents' actions did not violate Respondent's right to counsel because her criminal prosecution was not affected, and some discernible prejudice is an essential element with a Sixth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.244" offset="2904199">Second, we've said that even if the agents' conduct did infringe Respondent's constitutional right, dismissal of the indictment is not an appropriate remedy here because the violation caused Respondent no injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="732.538" offset="3073368">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think that's the essence of the government's second argument, that regardless of whether or not this conduct is thought to violate Respondent's Sixth Amendment rights in some abstract sense, to dismiss the indictment in this case where there's been no prejudice whatsoever, is to essentially reverse all the rules of relief and remedy that have been developed through the years, because the more effective... I mean, the more drastic relief is given in the case where the harm is the least serious, in fact, non-existent.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.619" offset="3221639">Before we even get to that point, however, the government's position is that the Respondent's Sixth Amendment rights weren't violated at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.363" offset="3264689">The Sixth Amendment provides that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.688" offset="3297916">Respondent had the assistance of counsel for her defense at all stages of the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.218" offset="3320068">She doesn't suggest that her counsel's assistance was in any way impaired and therefore the literal command of the amendment seems to have been satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.684" offset="3353923">The Court of Appeals' error was that it focused on the impropriety of the agents' conduct, rather than on the effect of the conduct on Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.400" offset="3384852">And that's not to say that these attempts by the government's agents to interfere with the attorney-client relationship should be condoned; it is only to say that the attempt in and of itself is not enough to violate the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.489" offset="3437201">The Sixth Amendment comprises a number of these procedural guarantees to ensure fairness of criminal prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.078" offset="3467503">If a government agents' attempt to deny a defendant of those guarantees fails, the defendant's right is fully exercised, the fairness of the proceeding is not affected and no constitutional violation has occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="1234.996" offset="5083229">I recommend... I commend that part of Massiah to the Court's attention, I think we quoted from it at some length in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.069" offset="5123458">Now on the second point, to pick up where Mr. Justice Rehnquist left off in his question earlier, it seems to us that this remedy is thoroughly disproportionate to what actually happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.393" offset="5172777">As Judge Garth observed in his dissent, the panel's decision effectively puts Respondent in a better position because she wasn't prejudiced by the agents' conduct than she would have been in if she had suffered some harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.684" offset="5229933">Because in that event, the existing more common remedies would have relieved her of any unfairness in the criminal prosecution; evidence that had been obtained could have been suppressed, or a new trial could have been ordered, if her trial had been tainted, but in this case, since she suffered no prejudice she winds up better off and the charges against her are completely dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.332" offset="5316555">Even in Gideon, where there was no attorney at all, at any time, in the prosecution, the remedy was a new trial with an attorney, not dismissal of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.500" offset="5357201">And I think that, as we say in our brief, it would be inconceivable for this Court to hold that a Fourth Amendment violation that resulted in no... in the acquisition of no evidence, should result in a dismissal of the indictment for that reason, rather than the suppression of any evidence that might have been found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.571" offset="5425538">Even in, in the Fifth Amendment context, in United States against Blue, where there allegedly was some evidence obtained in violation of the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, the Court specifically said that dismissal of the indictment was too drastic a remedy; the only remedy to which the defendant would have been entitled was suppression of that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.375" offset="5504741">Now, I think that in this respect the Court of Appeals' main error is that it assumed that whatever remedy there could be had to be a remedy in this criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.559" offset="5545492">This criminal proceeding involves events that occurred 16 months earlier, that had nothing to do with this agent's visit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.601" offset="5573600">The agent's visit was wrong, but it didn't affect that proceeding and there's no reason to think that any relief awarded has to be awarded in the pending criminal proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2938.531" offset="11897322">If... there was a deal that was struck, how could she enforce it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.544" offset="11921355">She lost that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.404" offset="11928878">Of course, she was sentenced harshly, which has been indicated in the reply brief that these overtures by the government were actually genuine, uses the word genuine on page 3, says there was nothing in the record to show that the overtures of the government agents were actually anything but genuine, Indeed they must have been genuine, but we today don't know whether or not she was sentenced so harshly because of what the agents said that they could do.</text>

            <text syncTime="3028.088" offset="12255513">She... there are indications that there were phone calls made to her on the third meeting, that Russ was coming.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.524" offset="12285293">And Russ was the investigator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.210" offset="12292085">And the person who really showed up was not Russ, but it was the DEA agents.</text>

            <text syncTime="3048.909" offset="12338896">If the Court please, this is a case that does not involve the kinds of lies that you've seen the government get involved in, in the past, in terms of some of these other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.434" offset="12388947">They are just misstatements of the truth, you're involved in what I consider extreme serious lack of understanding as to the requirements of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.834" offset="12446521">If the Court please, my client pled guilty to the best deal that she could receive in light of what occurred, in light of what the government did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.815" offset="12486436">To say that there was no problem... it's kind of similar to the situation when you show a gory picture to a jury and you tell the jury to forget about it, it didn't happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.247" offset="12536173">Well it did happen, and as I said earlier, she will never know whether had she cooperated, she would have received a lesser sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.290" offset="12580372">And as we've discussed earlier, the question of the remedy is only involved in one thing and that is dismissal of the charges, and I just want to make sure that next year, that some DEA agent isn't out in West Philadelphia saying to somebody, do you want your lawyer, the lawyer that's going to defend you next week, come down here at plea negotiation time and she says yes, and he'll say well you know, there was a lady by the name of Hazel Morrison and she wanted her lawyer too.</text>
