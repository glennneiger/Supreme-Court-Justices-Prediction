            <text syncTime="6.984" offset="119959">This case Number 79-935 is hereby way of the grant of a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.936" offset="171786">At a hearing before his criminal trial in a Missouri Court, the respondent, Willie McCurry invoked the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to suppress evidence that had been seized by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.944" offset="231763">The trial court denied the suppression motion in part, and McCurry was subsequently convicted after a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.264" offset="265095">And that conviction was later affirmed on appeal because he did not assert that the state courts had denied him a full and fair opportunity to litigate his search and seizure claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.285" offset="317131">McCurry was barred by this Court's decision in Stone against Powell from seeking a writ of habeas corpus in a Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.131" offset="356524">Nevertheless, he sought federal habeas and federal court were addressed for the alleged constitutional violation by bringing a damaged suit under 42 United States Code Section 1983 against the officers who had entered his home and seized the evidence in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.310" offset="433219">We granted certiorari to consider whether as the Court of Appeals held because of the unavailability of deferral habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.685" offset="470731">The defendants were prevented from raising the state court’s partial rejection of McCurry's constitutional claim as a collateral estoppel defense to the 1983 suit against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.207" offset="528827">For the reasons sent out in some detail in the Court opinion filed today, we hold that the Court of Appeals was mistaken in ruling that McCurry’s inability to obtain federal habeas corpus relief upon his Fourth Amendment claim renders -- rendered the doctrine of collateral estoppel inapplicable to his 1983 claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.733" offset="614927">Accordingly, the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for proceedings consistent with this Court’s opinion filed with the clerk today.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.039" offset="656200">Justice Blackmun has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Brennan and Justice Marshall have joined.</text>
