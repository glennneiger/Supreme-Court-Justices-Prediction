            <text syncTime="17.093" offset="221351">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="20.628" offset="235457">This case involves the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and especially the last provision of that Act, Section 504, which reads,</text>
            <text syncTime="38.339" offset="306302">"no other qualified handicapped individual will be excluded from or denied the benefits in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. "</text>
            <text syncTime="55.218" offset="373802">Now, in the Rehabilitation Act there were many sections, there were many programs, all of which set up appropriated money to accomplish the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.192" offset="421763">504 and 503 were sort of catch-all statutes at the end: you will not discriminate against the handicapped in any program receiving financial assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.933" offset="472649">Petitioners' first point, and I think I can characterize it as what we consider the most important point, is that 504 does not require the expenditure of any money by an institution, no affirmative action; it's a neutral statute which says that we will not discriminate the handicapped.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.817" offset="584244">You can participate; we will not deny you participation in a program or activity if you are able to participate in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.423" offset="618622">We say that for the Federal Government to require any type of affirmative action toward the handicapped, it will require a statute that's tied to the spending power of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.990" offset="720917">The Fourteenth Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause, again only requires the states to be neutral.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.927" offset="1260711">Yes, Your Honor, that has helped the University of Texas and Texas A&amp;M.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.831" offset="1284326">The other universities down there are not pleased with the fact that these two institutions are getting it all.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.966" offset="1304806">Well, to be perfectly frank, Mr. Justice Marshall, the University of Texas may be the richest university in the country now, more heavily endowed because of its oil properties than even Harvard University.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.024" offset="1353080">But what frightens everybody is not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.992" offset="1368963">What worries all state institutions, whether they be of higher education or other, is that the handicapped tie their demands to mainstream 100 deaf students at the University of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.139" offset="1457570">We cannot segregate them; they want to be separate in the class, with an interpreter for each one.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.495" offset="1482961">And just take Camenisch here, Walter Camenisch.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.130" offset="1501456">He got an interpreter to finish his master's degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.732" offset="1515875">Suppose he wished to continue in a PhD program, no program having any federal financial aid?</text>
            <text syncTime="349.521" offset="1551088">And by the way, the University of Texas does get a lot of grants, but they're specific grants for research, that are sitting over here.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.377" offset="1578465">Most of them, as a matter of fact, are not even close to the main campus of the University, they're out at the Balcones Research Center.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.829" offset="1600303">There are proposals made, certain things done, and we say that program does not infect the rest of the University.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.768" offset="1632068">But to get back to Walter Camenisch, he gets his PhD with the services of an interpreter, the entire time, paid for by the University of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.892" offset="1672506">Then he wishes to become a faculty member of the University of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.344" offset="1690373">He's otherwise qualified, if he didn't have the deaf problem, but since he can't communicate with students, they gave him a job, the University makes him an associate, or an assistant professor; he spends the rest of his career, academic career, with an interpreter that the University must provide him under the theory that Walter Camenisch, the respondent, and the other amici that support their position want.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.415" offset="1822657">Now, to carry it to the extreme... and really this is... if you read the briefs, and, gosh, I can't even remember them all, because they're just too many; it's difficult for me to decide who supports what position, but otherwise... he's otherwise qualified, without the handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.829" offset="1900293">Now, this statute now applies to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.466" offset="1926834">It didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.982" offset="1928924">And they're required to take affirmative action under it; there's been amendments, but they left the states out when they put the part about the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.986" offset="1960897">But here is a man who wants to be a fighter pilot without hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.973" offset="1980855">He's otherwise qualified; he's got a good mind, he can read the gauges.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.294" offset="2002171">He just can't move the buttons, punch the buttons and the dials.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.847" offset="2024323">What are you going to do with him?</text>
            <text syncTime="469.613" offset="2031428">A ruling, like what's asked for by the respondent, will put this Court, and all the courts, and all the institutions, the Federal Government, not only the states, in a situation of with a little affirmative action, or a whole lot of it, in the case of a fighter pilot without hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.527" offset="2115020">Where does it stop, is the point I'm making?</text>
            <text syncTime="496.665" offset="2139575">Now, again, the University of Texas is not heartless, and even in its deaf programs... I mean, even in its academic programs, it does provide deaf interpreters where there's a financial need.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.805" offset="2188163">There have been millions of dollars spent, some of it federal money, some of it state money.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.578" offset="2215226">We've got a state statute that forbids us from discriminating against the handicapped and makes us make building alterations.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.017" offset="2253051">So we have spent a lot of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.052" offset="2261201">My feelings and sentiments... I was interested, coming in last night, picking up a paper, hearing about the unfortunate tragedy as far as the President is concerned, but the paper that I picked up: U.S. Regulations&gt; ["]--</text>

            <text syncTime="556.405" offset="2378543">I certainly endorse that, but here, George Washington University is worrying about it and they're worrying about elevators for, I believe, seven handicapped people; seven.</text>

            <text syncTime="574.867" offset="2452417">And again, I'm not unsympathetic to the handicapped but society can only support so much, and we're saying that this statute, as respondents would have us to interpret it, just the imagination boggles.</text>

            <text syncTime="608.221" offset="2585851">So, basically, the question is whether the regulation is valid or not?</text>

          <turn speaker="lonny_f_zwiener" startTime="612.256" stopTime="814.337">
            <label>Mr. Lonny F. Zwiener</label>
            <text syncTime="612.256" offset="2601942">Well, it's also a question whether the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit is correct in saying, not just under the regulations, I think, but I think they went under the statute, so we do have that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.497" offset="2654919">We're saying that that's incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.683" offset="2659725">We're saying, as many courts have interpreted this statute, that they're incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.801" offset="2680205">Now, our second point is that 504 does not confer a private cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.657" offset="2707582">I would have rather argued this point before this Court decided Maine v. Thiboutot, because I'm not sure exactly how to handle this private cause of action now, since perhaps we don't have to state it but just have a statute and have a beneficiary, and then we have a 1983 cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.302" offset="2782187">But I would say that Congress can enact a statute like this one, and certainly it could have put explicit language in the statute that would say, private plaintiffs cannot bring suit; we do not mean this statute to cover that type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.830" offset="2856271">Again, as I say, I would have been much more comfortable arguing this point before the Maine v. Thiboutot case, if I am pronouncing it anywhere close to being right.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.738" offset="2903918">Now, something that's not in our brief is an amendment to the rehabilitation statute, which is 505.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.510" offset="2934951">And I point this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.362" offset="2946445">I feel that the respondent in the principal brief and the brief of the Civil Liberties Union and its companion amici are misquoting 505.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.170" offset="2997645">They say that now that we have 505, which does permit private causes of action in certain circumstances, there's no question.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.228" offset="3037874">However, they talk in terms of a private cause of action going to 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.381" offset="3062533">If you look at the statute, it goes to 501, which is an employment type of statute, and under that statute a private cause of action is authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.141" offset="3121570">All the remedies provided by Title VI are authorized, but not 504, as is said by respondent, and also the brief for the American Civil Liberties Union and its companions on the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.584" offset="3183324">As a matter of fact, that's the strongest evidence, I think, that we have of congressional intent, is that they did provide a private cause of action for a program designed to increase the employment of the handicapped, which is 501, but did not; 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.712" offset="3259810">And as I say, I think that I'm reading the statute correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.949" offset="3276737">Now, our third point is... and this is critical; it ties into the first point... that 504 refers to a program and activity that receives federal financial assistance and that's what it means, a program and activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.411" offset="3346641">Just because the University of Texas Maritime Center down on the coast gets a grant to study the fishing conditions in the Gulf of Mexico doesn't mean that 504 applies to Freshman English in Austin.</text>

            <text syncTime="840.722" offset="3515810">We say that it is properly before this Court because it's a jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.857" offset="3532424">You see, it's a threshold question.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.828" offset="3548306">A plaintiff cannot show that he's entitled to any relief without first showing that the program about which he's complaining receives federal financial assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.366" offset="3582475">Again, we're saying that's a threshold question which must be proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.251" offset="3602014">Now, we do have some briefs here that say that it's our burden to prove that the program does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.088" offset="3629286">I would say that would go in the teeth of a very, of a decision this Court rendered just a short time ago involving a Texas agency, the Texas Department of Human Resources v. Burdine, where someone sues because he's been discriminated against; he's got to show a little discrimination first before the defendant has to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.322" offset="3742239">And we're saying that this question, the program-specific, is jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.876" offset="3760421">The burden is on the plaintiff to prove it before he could even go forward with anything in his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.065" offset="3793231">And I would try a case that way the next time we go around.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.267" offset="3814024">And we say that Burdine mandates the fact, the premise, the conclusion that this is a jurisdictional question.</text>

            <text syncTime="982.761" offset="4084026">A proposal may be paid to the University or sometimes the Federal Government, some agency that needs some research done, will come to the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="3506.606" offset="14179412">In the Finch case, which was cited in my brief... and I think that their logic was excellent here; this was a Title VI case, a public school that did receive some Federal monies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.997" offset="14228940">But the court said, just because there were problems somewhere in the school, we are not going to cut off all the federal monies and do away with a lot of beneficial programs.</text>
