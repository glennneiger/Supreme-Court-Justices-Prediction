            <text syncTime="118.358" offset="630129">Indeed, this Court observed in 1963 in Eichel v. New York Central Railroad Company, quoting a lower court decision, that the Railroad Retirement Act is substantially a social security act for employees of common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.447" offset="682478">Railroad retirement and social security have been separate systems since their inception in the 1930s but over the years they have been integrated in many respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.851" offset="720094">Congress integrated the two programs even further when it thoroughly revised the Railroad Retirement Act in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.456" offset="746530">Section 3(h)(1) at issue in this case is a product of these further efforts at integration.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.329" offset="770041">That section limits eligibility for what Congress perceived to be a windfall accruing to certain persons who were eligible to receive both social security and railroad retirement benefits under prior law.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.948" offset="820509">Because the relationship between social security and railroad retirement provides important background for addressing the issues presented in this case, I would first like to briefly describe that relationship and the origins of Section 3(h)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="180.162" offset="877352">I will then explain Appellee's constitutional challenge to Section 3(h)(1) in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.925" offset="900444">Railroad retirement benefits are paid out of a railroad retirement account established in the Treasury and financed by payroll taxes imposed on carriers and their employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.810" offset="951957">In 1951 Congress instituted a financial interchange between this railroad retirement account and the social security trust fund, which was designed to place the trust fund in exactly the position it would have been in if railroad work had been covered by the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.758" offset="1015801">Under this financial interchange, funds are transferred each year from the railroad retirement account to the trust fund in amount equal to the taxes the carriers and their employees would have paid if they'd been covered by social security.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.345" offset="1066165">In return funds are transferred back from the trust fund to the account in amount equal to the benefits that would have been paid to retired railroad workers, their survivors, and dependents, if railroad work had been covered by the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.215" offset="1125619">The effect of this arrangement was to provide a type of reinsurance for the railroad retirement system.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.056" offset="1148921">However, it became increasingly apparent in the years following 1951 that this arrangement did not have the desired effect in the case of employees who were entitled to receive both social security and railroad retirement benefits, perhaps as a result of having split their careers between work covered by the one act and work covered by the other act.</text>

            <text syncTime="286.213" offset="1301580">This... the problem resulted because under the financial interchange program, whenever a retired railroad worker received social security benefits directly from the trust fund, the reinsurance payment from the trust fund to the railroad retirement account was reduced by the amount of the social security benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.066" offset="1368976">The result was a shortfall in the income to the account necessary to pay the railroad retirement benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.773" offset="1631872">Aside from the financial difficulties that these dual benefits created, it was also perceived by the late 1960s that the payment of dual benefits was inequitable because a person who split his career between railroad and nonrailroad work received more in combined benefits than a person would receive if he had spent his entire career in an industry covered by just one act or the other.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="407.211" offset="1785577">Yes, it is, and the reports on the 1974 legislation do call attention to the fact that this problem of overlapping benefits does arise in several different situations and there is no deduction in the manner of this case in those other situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.095" offset="1853077">But the distinction that was perceived here, in the committee reports was that the railroad retirement system is different because it was really designed as a social security system, a parallel program, and there was a financial interchange between the two that does not occur, for instance, in the case of military retirement or federal civil service retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.959" offset="1940535">And in addition, in those cases, in federal civil service and military, the Government stands as employer to the persons who were receiving the benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.911" offset="1972405">Here, in this case, the Government is using its taxing and spending power, or the power to regulate interstate commerce, in collecting revenues and paying benefits in the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.937" offset="2016499">So these differences, I think, serve to distinguish why Congress took the first step in integrating the two programs under the Railroad Retirement Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.120" offset="2053175">Against this background Congress sought in the 1974 act to integrate the two programs further and to phase out the windfall that was perceived to result from the receipt of dual benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.067" offset="2117019">First, Congress divided up the basic railroad retirement benefit that had been paid under prior law into two components which were discussed in this Court, by this Court, in Hisquierdo two terms ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.140" offset="2165293">The lower tier of those benefits is exactly comparable to what the person would receive under the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.762" offset="2187758">The upper tier is smaller in amount and computed solely on the basis of railroad work.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.197" offset="2213567">In order to eliminate the dual benefit problem, however, Congress provided that the first tier of benefits, the one that corresponds to social security, would be reduced whenever the retired railroad worker received social security benefits directly from the trust fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.926" offset="2280441">This eliminated the windfall, it eliminated the drain on the railroad retirement account, and it also had the effect of passing through to the individual beneficiary the reduction that had been made in the reinsurance payment because of the receipt of social security benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.685" offset="2351494">Although these changes were designed to eliminate the dual benefit problem in the future, Congress did include or carry forward in the 1974 act certain transitional provisions to preserve this windfall element for certain people who may have been eligible to receive benefits under both acts prior to 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.237" offset="2449714">This transitional or 3(h) of the Act, the section that is at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.498" offset="2494749">Section 3(h) provides yet a third tier of benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act for certain of the persons whose first tier was reduced because they were receiving dual benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.289" offset="2541874">Thus, in effect, the third tier adds back what was taken away under the first tier, and the effect is to isolate in a separate section and as a separate benefit that portion of the combined social security and railroad retirement benefits that Congress had perceived to be a windfall or an overlap under prior law, and the act limits the eligibility for these benefits to certain individuals who may have been eligible, who would have been eligible to receive these dual benefits under prior law.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.497" offset="2670710">First of all, everyone who is retired and already receiving benefits under both programs on the effective date of the act, December 31, 1974, may continue to receive benefits under both programs, including the windfall element, although this windfall element is not increased with the cost of living over time.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.408" offset="2762348">It's frozen from the date of retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.329" offset="2774050">For persons who were not yet retired in 1974, however, the standards for determining eligibility for being protected under the grandfather provisions depend on whether the person was... in general, on whether the person was affiliated with the railroad industry in 1974 or whether he had left the industry and had started to pursue other work.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.506" offset="2874779">Employees who were still working in the railroad industry in 1974 or had what the act terms 12 out of the preceding 30 months... the two of them together I would call an affiliation with the railroad industry... those persons are eligible to receive this transitional windfall benefit if they had completed the necessary ten years of railroad retirement and the necessary amount of social security work, ordinarily 40 quarters, to complete the eligibility requirements under both acts by December 31, 1974, when Congress changed the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.974" offset="3028588">In addition to these persons who still had an affiliation with the industry, Congress also included in this category long-term employees who had 25 years of railroad service even though they may have left railroad work when the 1974 act went into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.453" offset="3090550">Persons who had left railroad work before 1974 but did not have the 25 years of eligibility were treated differently under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.387" offset="3130256">They could receive a windfall element only if they had satisfied the length of service requirements under both acts when they left railroad work.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.431" offset="3162439">And the amount they received is somewhat smaller.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.788" offset="3175918">It's under Section 3(h)(2) of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.287" offset="3181874">It's smaller because the amount of the benefit is calculated on the basis of what they expected to receive when they left railroad work, as opposed to later, in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.518" offset="3218759">Thus, if a person left railroad work in 1966, for example, and had ten years of railroad work but had not yet work 40 quarters in social security, he would not be eligible under the act to receive any windfall or carryover benefit because it was not until later that he became qualified to receive social security benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.150" offset="3309352">The present case, challenging the constitutionality of these qualification provisions in Section 3(h)(1) was filed in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.442" offset="3354491">I believe Fritz was the representative of the certified class of beneficiaries under the Act who had become eligible to retire after 1974 when the act went into effect, but before January of 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.716" offset="3431605">That happened to be the span the court defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.886" offset="3440277">Persons who were eligible to retire but were not eligible to receive the windfall benefit because they had not either been affiliated with the railroad industry in 1974 or had not completed the necessary qualifications under both acts in whatever earlier year they may have left the railroad industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1238.453" offset="5110547">The distinction drawn here furthers a number of the statutory purposes of the act, and since this does not, since this act does not exclude on the basis of a suspect category, or exercise of a fundamental right, it is sufficient that the category be rationally related to legitimate Government purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.613" offset="5207200">Now, first, this Court stated in Hisquierdo two terms ago, citing the committee reports on the act in the 1930s, that the purpose of the act was to provide retirement benefits for persons who were pursuing careers in the railroad industry, and so to provide them with the opportunity to live out the closing years of their life in comfort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.278" offset="5285881">Well, the line drawn under Section 3(h)(1) accomplishes this purpose because when the act was passed the persons who were pursuing their careers in the railroad industry were those who were still affiliated with it, or people who had spent 25 years in the industry by that time had pursued the major portion of their careers in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.457" offset="5366547">The other people who had left the industry were pursuing their careers elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.315" offset="5382011">Second, in a related purpose of the act, which was also identified in Hisquierdo, was to provide an incentive for older workers to retire and thereby to open up more job opportunities for younger workers and more rapid advancement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.698" offset="5443556">Section 3(h)(1) is consistent with this purpose as well, because it is only necessary to provide an incentive to retire for people who are still in the railroad industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.429" offset="5482426">For people who have left there would be no... even if the windfall benefit was an incremental incentive to retire, their retirement would not open up jobs for younger workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.847" offset="5524117">The third purpose that is served is the one that I previously mentioned and one that's furthered by any grandfather provision, and that is trying to accommodate the equities if persons who may have been affected by a change in the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1505.436" offset="6178432">And the rational basis approach I've suggested is particularly appropriate in a case like this because the benefit we're talking about here is not one that was designed to meet an identifiable need that Congress saw on behalf of the beneficiaries, as is the case with most welfare or social security benefits, or even most benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.085" offset="6269130">This benefit was a conceded anomaly that occurred under prior law solely by virtue of the fact that Congress decided to have two parallel social security-type programs rather than combining them into one comprehensive program.</text>

            <text syncTime="1707.933" offset="6988437">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.414" offset="7022397">The correct issue of this appeal is this: did the District Court commit error when it found that the Congress's elimination of plaintiffs' then-vested retirement benefits denied them equal protection under the law?</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.471" offset="7082583">Based upon the undisputed record made below, the District Court, we submit, rightly concluded that the 1974 act's classification which is here involved was utterly irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.779" offset="7135872">It is my intent here to emphasize several of the primary reasons why the classification is indeed irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.009" offset="7164816">Number one: I want to take up the point that we make in the briefs about this being contrary, the classification being contrary to the actual purposes of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.006" offset="7204731">Number two: I want to take up briefly the fact that they are contrary to the Railroad Study Commission's recommendations made to Congress pertinent to resolving solvency problems relevant to the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.158" offset="7253319">And number three: the fact that regardless of the above, the distinction made in the act between the pertinent vested classes here to be discussed is in and of itself irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.058" offset="7296996">First, the classification is contrary to the actual and declared purposes of the 1974 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.820" offset="7332000">Congress expressly declared in the purposes section of the report, twice, its intent to preserve all retirement benefits which were then vested under prior law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.896" offset="7372333">Indeed, the Railroad Board itself, the defendant in this cause of action, assured Congress of this during the hearings on this bill.</text>

            <text syncTime="1811.438" offset="7402530">Well, Mr. Byron, how can you say that when in fact it's conceded that the legislation if read according to its meaning has the effect that you claim is unconstitutional?</text>

            <text syncTime="1827.432" offset="7466478">I say that because the Railroad Board itself assured Congress that our class was included.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel P. Byron</label>
            <text syncTime="1839.240" offset="7513708">No, but I think it is easy to understand as we go through the legislative history here why Congress thought they were including everyone, but nevertheless did not; that the plaintiff's class was actually exempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.376" offset="7558220">You're absolutely correct that Section 3(h) does exclude the plaintiffs by its operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.202" offset="7581521">However, I would think it defies logical analysis to read Section 3(h)(1) and (2) and understand who might be, who might lose their vested benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.087" offset="7625094">In fact, the act does not speak of vesting at all, and when you look at the committee reports, they never mention divestment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.116" offset="7653201">The reports mention the concept that everybody who had then, were then vested under both systems, social security and railroad retirement, was actually covered under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.096" offset="7705133">And they make it a primary purpose of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.518" offset="7714850">And then they go on to say... because I pick up the point that the defense has made... that this is a windfall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.406" offset="7738361">And they seem to be critical of the fact that this is a so-called windfall... which, by the way it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.029" offset="7756855">But they seem to be critical of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.576" offset="7766991">Congress put in the primary purposes section of this statute, Congress said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.464" offset="7786635">"Dual beneficiaries cannot be criticized because they relied upon the law as it then existed. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.853" offset="7812130">And that's exactly what our people do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.586" offset="7819131">They fit squarely within the pegs of any equities that were discussed by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="1953.196" offset="7969492">However, it has some relevancy as to what are the legislative objectives of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.475" offset="7990599">So I'm saying it has some relevancy; however, it is not a dispositive factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.972" offset="8012646">I think the concern here is the fact that this is written into the primary purposes section of the statute and they continue to pound away at the point that the Congress does not mean to criticize dual beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.107" offset="8069175">And if they really meant that, then they would not have meant to divest our rail-roaders, who were actually covered under both laws and had fully performed ten to 20 years of railroad service and were inactives and had then gone out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.009" offset="8120793">But the point I wanted to make was the Railroad Board, after reviewing the final bill as it pertains to 3(h), in their written statement to Congress two of the three Railroad Board members said this, and I ask the indulgence of the Court to just give a very short quote:</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.298" offset="8181920">"It is sufficient to state here that existing rights to such benefits will not be adversely affected by this bill. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.733" offset="8211699">This was the recommendation of the Commission on Railroad Retirement and this bill so provides, and this bill does just the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.200" offset="8241583">That was the written testimony of Railroad Retirement Board members Neal Speirs and Wythe Quarles at the Senate hearings on this bill at page 289.</text>

            <text syncTime="2304.226" offset="9373626">The question was put to Mr. Kneedler about the conserving of fiscal resources as being a basis, a sine qua non for actually having this statute pass muster with the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.188" offset="9429528">That is not enough, obviously, because if it were you would be saying that every congressional cutback would avoid and be immunized from scrutiny under the equal protection clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2333.652" offset="9491386">I think he is saying we still, you must still find rationality on this, and there is still equal protection analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.148" offset="9525345">We are not here arguing a toothless standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.615" offset="9535167">But on this question of conservation of fiscal resources, it's very interesting because the Railroad Study Commission reported to Congress, concerned itself with the elimination of a 9 percent actuarial deficiency, and that is well and fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.079" offset="9589084">However, that was not resolved or furthered by the elimination of the plaintiff's benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.233" offset="9609668">Instead, these benefits were confiscated so as to help fund other unrelated benefits that were liberalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.341" offset="9638090">The liberalization caused the deficiency to escalate to 12 percent, contrary to the very purpose that they were negotiating on this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.275" offset="9673825">The 3 percent increased deficiency which was created by the Joint Labor-Management Negotiating Committee was funded in part, as we point out in our briefs, by a trade-off of the plaintiffs' benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.754" offset="9719801">And that, we submit, is contrariwise to what they were supposed to be doing to resolve the actuarial deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.953" offset="9752506">And the act's classification was also contrary to the Study Commission's recommendations to Congress in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.262" offset="9781763">Number one, the Commission strongly and repeatedly urged the retention of all vested rights to retirement benefits as of the new proposed changeover date, which would be December 31, '74.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.242" offset="9829724">The Commission also repeatedly stated that any liberalization of benefits must... and this is one of the few times the Commission used the word "must"... they said, must be accomplished without impairing any presently vested rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.471" offset="9886671">Further, they emphasized that liberalizations under this act can only be funded by an increase in taxes on employer-employee sufficient to pay for the liberalizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.810" offset="9932019">And that makes every sense in the world, because Congress was trying to resolve an actuarial deficiency, not create a greater one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.307" offset="9957933">But the JLMC, but what happened here is, you sent the fox out to guard the chicken coop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.009" offset="9976741">And the fox goes out and creates another 3 percent deficiency and the only way you can get that job done is to, in the words of the JLMC, "hit" or eliminate the plaintiff class because they're inactives and they don't have to answer to the unions anymore.</text>

            <text syncTime="2715.718" offset="11019654">The problem was that they went out and made the deficiency from 9 percent to 12 percent and then used our class as part of the trade-off to fund the other 3 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.729" offset="11059673">But I think... I want to get this point about the real distinction here, the rational distinction between the classes, because we're only talking here about a distinction based on timing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.445" offset="11106485">It's a new timing requirement, you see, that divided the vesteds, the similarly situated vesteds, between... all of us, all of the vesteds, had 10 to 25 years of railroad service and ten years of social security, thereby earning a full dual benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.031" offset="11168865">However, and for the first time ever, Congress in 3(h)(1) and 3(h)(2) brought about this new current connection requirement and gave four different ways in which our people who were vested back on December 31, 1974, could continue to be vested under the new act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.179" offset="11257472">Actually, what that is is a divesting rule, and the Government concedes that only timing of their prior railroad service is the question here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.255" offset="11289760">And this new timing requirement, you understand, amounted to a changing of the vesting rules ex post facto, i.e., after the game was played and the benefit had been earned and acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.750" offset="11335735">Its sole purpose as the legislative history we've put in our brief shows, the sole purpose was to "hit" and to "eliminate" the inactive railroaders who had no... that the unions, they felt, had no allegiance to anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.805" offset="11399997">Somebody had to go, in their opinion, and that was not true, because as we've said, it was only true because they raised the deficiency to 12 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.037" offset="11432911">Timing has nothing to do with the extent or the length of the railroaders' credited service.</text>

            <text syncTime="3164.258" offset="12813743">It speaks of a current connection, not a career connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.054" offset="12824924">No one is calling this the career connection rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.257" offset="12833806">Nor was it ever suggested in Congress or anywhere else that it might be.</text>

            <text syncTime="3340.531" offset="13518841">And indeed, of course, the Railroad Study Commission never considered it and Congress never really addressed it in the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.529" offset="13542873">Now, we mention several other points that we feel heighten the irrationality of the statute here involved, including the reliance on benefits and the vested nature of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.961" offset="13592610">We also point out that the age and inability of our railroaders to rework their careers... because, you see, they're all of advanced age... they cannot relive their lives; they cannot recoup their loss by some other means of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.050" offset="13648930">For our railroaders, the loss comes about at a point when it's too late for them to say, well, I guessed wrong, and I've got to go back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.312" offset="13686024">They can't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.014" offset="13692816">But, of course, there is no encouragement under this act to get them back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.153" offset="13705355">In summary, let me say that to reverse the decision of the District Court in this case would be to say that the plaintiffs, whose working lives are essentially over, guessed wrong as to that most finite and once-only resource, their own working years and lives; that what they were told by Congress were the requirements for vesting, and what they were told would be their reward for staying with the industry for ten years--</text>

            <text syncTime="3561.083" offset="14401048">Just several points I wanted to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.644" offset="14415363">We submit that it is not necessary to look beyond the plain meaning of the language of the act to determine that the Appellee class was excluded, but if it were, the committee reports on page 12 of each report could not be clearer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.248" offset="14473773">They both say it in identical language, '74... they would not receive a dual benefit upon retirement unless they also had fully qualified under social security by the close of the year prior to '75 in which they left railroad service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.554" offset="14546916">If they had so qualified under both systems at that point, however, they would receive dual benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.738" offset="14567709">So Congress plainly knew what it was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.909" offset="14580352">Secondly, Appellee suggests that all, that Congress really had to take an all-or-nothing approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.077" offset="14613058">It either had to wipe out what he refers to as vested benefits, which I think are more properly referred to as an expectation of receiving benefits under prior law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.917" offset="14656421">Congress had the choice of either wiping them all out of wiping none of them out, and could not take a middle course.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.853" offset="14680140">The Congress was faced with a serious financial problem in the railroad retirement account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.146" offset="14709293">And Congress tried to accommodate the financial needs of the system against what are inevitably degrees of equity among people who may have had expectations under prior law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.112" offset="14749208">The concept of reliance really has no basis here, because as was pointed out in Hisquierdo these benefits are not contractual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.560" offset="14778988">Railroad retirement is a direct parallel of social security, and this Court made clear in Flemming that Congress can change those.</text>

            <text syncTime="3668.978" offset="14832695">Let me just be sure I understand the practical argument your opponent makes about a man not being able to live his life over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.383" offset="14854220">Is it correct that in, say, 1955, a man who had ten years of railroad service and therefore had vested rights under that service could have been motivated to retire from railroad service with the expectation that he would supplement his retirement income by earning social security benefits which Congress has now taken away from him?</text>
