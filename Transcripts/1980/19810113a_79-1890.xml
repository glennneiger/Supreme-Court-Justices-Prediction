            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="14.760" offset="207639">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.378" offset="222058">We deal this morning with the Kenai Moose Range which I am told has been renamed the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge a month ago in the enacted Alaska lands bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.237" offset="281513">That range or refuge is in south central Alaska, just south of Anchorage, and east of Cook Inlet.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.510" offset="318607">It comprises approximately two million acres of lands, all within the Kenai Peninsula Borough, boroughs in Alaska being comparable to counties elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.087" offset="376912">It was established by withdrawal of public domain or public lands in the United States, some 40 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.756" offset="407528">Ever since the mid-1950s oil and gas leases have been issued by the United States covering portions of that acreage and substantial revenues have been derived therefrom.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.183" offset="465311">Indeed, since 1965 approximately $80 million in royalties, rents, and bonuses have accrued from those leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.843" offset="519959">The issue presented to the Court is how those federal revenues from this refuge ought to be distributed, whether according to the formula in the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as Alaska maintains, which would have the result of apportioning 90 percent, in the particular case of Alaska, to the State and ten percent retained in the federal treasury; or whether the appropriate formula is that ordained by the Wildlife Refuge Revenue Sharing Act, an Act originally passed in 1935 and amended in 1964, relevant to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.907" offset="704174">According to that formula, the same revenues would be divided 25 percent to the county out of which these lands have been created, or this refuge has been created, and the remainder, 75 percent, would go to the Conservation Fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.389" offset="806156">In practice, the first formula, the formula of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, was followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.645" offset="839175">And indeed, until anyone thought about it, which was so far as the record indicates for the first time in 1975, that distribution formula obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.071" offset="896853">At that time, in 1975, the Fish and Wildlife Service in Alaska wondered to itself, and then out loud, whether the right formula was being applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.914" offset="960174">They accordingly inquired of the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior for advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.151" offset="981177">He gave the opinion that it was being done wrongly and that the formula of the Refuge Act, 25 percent to the county, is the one that should have obtained at least since 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.326" offset="1037810">He, in turn, the Solicitor, asked the opinion of the Comptroller General of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.064" offset="1064769">The Comptroller General agreed with the Solicitor and ruled accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.216" offset="1085458">Alaska then asked for reconsideration of that opinion, which was duly given, but the Comptroller General adhered to his view and reaffirmed his previous ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.841" offset="1131955">At this point the Kenai Peninsula Borough would have been the recipient under the Refuge Act and who would now become the recipient under the ruling of the Comptroller General, brought suit against the Secretary of the Interior seeking a declaration that the Comptroller was indeed correct and that his decision ought to be followed; and also asking that the Secretary of the Interior be required to recoup the monies now determined to have been erroneously paid to Alaska rather than to the county in the previous decade.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.485" offset="1286496">Promptly thereafter the State of Alaska initiated a separate lawsuit against the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Comptroller General, seeking to set aside the ruling of the Comptroller General and to obtain a declaration and an injunction that the old formula that had been followed in practice should continue to be followed, and that Alaska should continue to receive 90 percent of these revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.668" offset="1399240">The suits were consolidated in the district court and in the meantime the monies accruing from the time of the filing of the suits were held in suspense, where they still are.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.772" offset="1519613">The ruling having gone against the Government in the district court and the court of appeals because there's been no occasion to consider whether, should that ruling be reversed here, it would be appropriate to seek recoupment, in our view it's a decision which the Government is free to embark upon but cannot be compelled to undertake.</text>

            <text syncTime="397.321" offset="1737787">I think, Mr. Chief Justice, without being able to cite precedents, that one can find examples on both sides; that is, cases in which the United States for reasons of equity thought it improper to seek to redress the past; other instances in which it was thought right to recoup the money and redistribute it in accordance with what is now declared to be the correct rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="423.906" offset="1844158">Well, Mr. Claiborne, both the question of Justice Stevens and the question of the Chief Justice suggest that the answer reached by the 9th Circuit is wrong in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.696" offset="1895358">I realize there's a good deal of money turning on the issue, but when you get right down to the statutory materials and go to the presumption against implied repeals and the specific governing the general and other such maxims, on the legal issue isn't it pretty close to a coin toss?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="463.716" stopTime="716.560">
            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="463.716" offset="2003400">I would not have thought so, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but I own that two courts have held against our position and we cannot therefore say that it's absolutely clear cut that the Government's view as announced by the Comptroller General and as we urge here is the correct one.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.046" offset="2092739">I do invoke the plain meaning rule as the governing canon of construction in this case and this seems in our submission a peculiarly appropriate instance in which Congress spoke as clearly as one could hope for, much more clearly than is the usual case, and one in which one ought to accept Congress at its word.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.763" offset="2199632">And if one follows that analysis which we submit is the correct one, then the case is indeed plain that an error has been committed for these ten years and perhaps under those circumstances the proper remedy is to redress that past error.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.694" offset="2279358">We are not speaking of the individual private persons who have relied to their detriment on the error of the Administrator who is speaking of a state whose mineral revenues are so generous that they are able to repay their own citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.742" offset="2375489">At all events, as the Court well knows, the district court ruled against the Secretary, despite finding that the plain meaning of the statute was as contended for, but holding in what can only be described as a most unusual construction of the statute that the word "minerals", though in the statute apparently applicable to both refuges made up of acquired land and those made up of public domain lands, must be construed by a judicial decree with the words of the statute so as to apply only in the one case and not in the other, the reasoning behind that being that this would accomplish no change in the law and that there was insufficient indication that Congress by adding the word "minerals" to the Revenue Sharing Act meant to accomplish any change of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.934" offset="2640266">The court of appeals affirmed that decision, basically on the same reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.438" offset="2670254">Now this case reaches the courts, and at least this Court, only because of two circumstances that occurred after the relevant statute had been enacted; unfortunately, not such rare occurrences, but still unfortunate.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.250" offset="2749562">The first is that the Department of the Interior was very slow in implementing the change of law, if that's what it was, which had occurred in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.225" offset="2805464">The second was that Congress, though having a clear opportunity to indicate which was the correct view of their own statute, expressly declined that invitation in 1978 and said, since the matter is before the Court, we will let the courts decide what we meant in 1964 rather than resolving it themselves and sparing this and the other courts the need for resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.800" offset="2963766">Now the statute on its face, everyone has agreed, at least until Alaska filed its brief in this Court, was perfectly plain.</text>

            <text syncTime="716.560" offset="3014757">Mr. Claiborne, before you get into your analysis of the '64 statute, would you tell me what is the statutory authority for the Secretary to derive revenues from the sale of timber, hay, grass, and all these others, sand and gravel, the things other than minerals?</text>
            <text syncTime="733.922" offset="3084243">Is there some statute that authorizes the disposition of those?</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="739.074" offset="3104827">The authority as understood by the Department and indeed as recited in rulings of the Solicitor is that the so called Wildlife Refuge Revenue Sharing Act as originally enacted in 1935 does authorize the Secretary... and, indeed, the words are reasonably clear to that end... does authorize the Secretary to grant sales or dispositions, which in this context are understood to include leases, of those products... in the case of some of the products it's an outright sale, but in other instances it's leases... with respect to both refuges made up of acquired lands and those made up of public domain lands, without distinction.</text>

            <text syncTime="803.330" offset="3361872">We suggest that that is a possible construction of the 1935 Act, even before its amendment, and indeed that was the ruling of the Acting Solicitor of the Department of the Interior in 1946, before the Acquired Lands Act had been passed, and therefore the only authority then available with respect to mineral leases on acquired lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.099" offset="3472945">He read the word 1935 Refuge Act as including the lease for oil and gas on acquired lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.907" offset="3524145">If it applied to acquired lands, it likewise applied to public domain lands, though unnecessarily, since the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 was already available for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.449" offset="3566359">We do not deem it necessary for this Court to decide that question, that is, what the law was before 1964, because in 1964 Congress added the word "minerals" to those revenues which could be leased, those resources which could be leased, and the revenues from mineral leases as among those that ought to be distributed according to the formula of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.734" offset="3687462">And it was that very plain action of adding the word "minerals" that moots out the question--</text>

            <text syncTime="892.824" offset="3719854">It isn't entirely mooted out, because isn't it normally true that the division of revenues would be computed according to a statute that also grants the authority to make the lease in the first place?</text>
            <text syncTime="903.780" offset="3763635">It's somewhat unusual in your position to have the statutory authority for everything but minerals in one statute, and the mineral leasing authority in another statute, but say that doesn't govern the way the money should be divided up.</text>

            <text syncTime="928.330" offset="3861856">I would point out that all leases of public lands are distributed, or granted, under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 so far as the mechanics are concerned, whether they're acquired lands or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.090" offset="3920893">The Acquired Lands Act, for instance, simply says, you may apply the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 to acquired lands as you have been doing with respect to other lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="1111.080" offset="4592866">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.281" offset="4601644">My name is Charles Cranston from Anchorage, Alaska, representing the Kenai Peninsula Borough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.852" offset="4624004">I think I'd like to start off by addressing the very question that Justice White asked, and that is, is there not some justification for treating differently counties with reserved land refuge from those counties which have acquired land refuges?</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.666" offset="4711253">And my answer to that is, no, there is no difference for treating those counties differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.486" offset="4738525">And I'll explain why I believe that is the case, and perhaps with that we can understand really why this case is here.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="1156.775" offset="4775619">Just by way of definition, to clarify it for me at least, when you speak of the term "acquired lands", are those always lands which have been on the tax rolls before they were acquired?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_k_cranston" startTime="1172.118" stopTime="1249.318">
            <label>Mr. Charles K. Cranston</label>
            <text syncTime="1172.118" offset="4837059">Presumably so, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.970" offset="4844478">I believe that certainly under the new Act, '78 amendment, acquired lands are called fee lands, and those were lands which were previously held in fee by private individuals and reacquired by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.728" offset="4899440">Thus, if they were held in fee, presumably they were taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.699" offset="4915322">The reserved lands, on the other hand, were always part of the public domain and were never taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.018" offset="4940609">I think if you look at the Kenai Peninsula Borough itself we have a striking example of why the reserved land county should be the recipient of these wildlife refuge revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.195" offset="5005288">In the case of Kenai there have been two million acres withdrawn from the tax roll.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.651" offset="5039142">Admittedly those lands were never on the tax roll, but nevertheless two million acres of land remain unavailable for the tax base of this borough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.977" offset="5092432">If we apply conservative property tax estimates, that will equal anywhere from six to $10 million a year of tax revenues.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="1249.318" offset="5145826">Are you relating that to current rates of tax in that area?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles K. Cranston</label>
            <text syncTime="1254.372" offset="5165993">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I am.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.622" offset="5171009">I am assuming a very low appraisal of $100 an acre and a very low mill rate of from three to five mills, which is roughly within the range of the current tax rate in that borough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.065" offset="5232762">Now, considering the fact that this wildlife refuge has development, oil and gas development, which requires services such as fire protection, it of course increases the population of the borough, schools, the development in essence adds to the load on the borough to provide public services.</text>

            <label>Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="1298.134" offset="5341118">But, Mr. Cranston, is that any different than the situation of any other western state that was admitted to the Union, where the Federal Government started out owning 70 or 80 percent of the land in the state?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_k_cranston" startTime="1312.209" stopTime="1398.398">
            <label>Mr. Charles K. Cranston</label>
            <text syncTime="1312.209" offset="5397438">It could be, Justice Rehnquist, in that I believe it's unusual in all of the public domain to have development of that public domain, which adds to the services which the local government must provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.207" offset="5485418">That is to say, simply, if you have grazing on BLM grazing land, that doesn't necessarily increase the type of intensive use of the land that requires additional services which normally are provided by the county's tax base.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.603" offset="5555009">And so I believe that in the case of oil development, albeit on a wildlife refuge, there is a legitimate reason for treating the county with a reserved refuge the same as one with an acquired refuge, because the net result is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.266" offset="5637660">You have the development, you have the increased population, you have the need to provide the services, there is no difference in rationale as to why one should be treated differently if you look at it from the standpoint of the county and if you look at it from the revenue obligation of the county, that is the threat to the county's revenues and the threat to the county's tax base.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="1398.398" stopTime="1408.122">
            <label>Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="1398.398" offset="5742150">But the county's tax base derives ultimately from the authority of the Alaska Legislature, does it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_k_cranston" startTime="1408.122" stopTime="1603.680">
            <label>Mr. Charles K. Cranston</label>
            <text syncTime="1408.122" offset="5781020">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.741" offset="5795544">But the Alaska Legislature has permitted counties to tax land as well as improvements, and it is certainly expected that when the land itself is taken out of the tax base, there certainly is significant reduction in available tax revenue to the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.190" offset="5889271">That is, it may only then tax the improvements, and in the case of an acquired refuge, the county, as in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, is a good example, may tax both the land and improvements and there is really no reason why one should be treated any differently than the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.651" offset="5963146">And I think this is what Congress recognized certainly in the 1964 amendment, when if you read the statute, if one were asked to draft a statute which gave authority to the Secretary to transmit 25 percent of reserved land refuges revenues to the counties, and 25 percent of acquired land refuge revenues, you couldn't come up with language any different from that which appears in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.807" offset="6099818">And I believe Congress must have recognized the similarity of result both as to acquired and as to reserved land refuges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.013" offset="6140569">Thus, again going to the question with which I started this argument, there is really no basis upon which to distinguish between the two types.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.125" offset="6209010">And I would also like to address the question which Justice Rehnquist did ask early in this argument, is it not close to a coin toss as to how these statutes should be interpreted?</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.301" offset="6273794">And again I would answer that question by saying, no, it is not close to a coin toss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.869" offset="6296050">I think the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 and the Wildlife Refuge Sharing Act are clearly inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.060" offset="6332831">You can't have one and the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.993" offset="6340563">There has to be a choice, either the Mineral Leasing Act applies, or the Wildlife Refuge Sharing Act applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.099" offset="6372955">And this Court on numerous occasions has stated, and most recently in SEC v. Sloan, that where there is a clear inconsistency between the statutes involved, that apart from any express indication of congressional intent, there is an implied repeal of at least the inconsistent provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.233" offset="6477444">Now, we certainly aren't saying that all of the Mineral Leasing Act goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.951" offset="6492386">That of course is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.553" offset="6498760">But certainly those provisions of the Mineral Leasing Act which allocate revenues between the counties and the Federal Government must apply in this case, since otherwise you have the clear inconsistency.</text>

            <text syncTime="1634.032" offset="6684648">Mr. Cranston, how do you explain the fact that apparently the change was drafted by the Department of Interior as a perfecting amendment, and yet they didn't apparently realize that the change meant what you now say it means, for at least ten years?</text>

            <text syncTime="1652.160" offset="6757164">--Certainly Interior in its early letters, when this Act came before Congress in 1962, added the word "minerals", and called it a perfecting amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.086" offset="6816932">I think there are probably two answers to the question, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.388" offset="6830098">One is that the amendment was simply recognizing what had been at least the idea or the concept of Interior before the 1964 amendment, and that's reflected in numerous memoranda which are in the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.017" offset="6904599">I won't refer them, but I think they've been referred to in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.652" offset="6923198">Secondly, I think it's fair to say that the effect of the perfecting amendment did not filter down to those individuals in the Fish and Wildlife Service, principally in Alaska, people who were responsible for administering the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.482" offset="7002506">I think my only explanation can be that there was an administrative oversight inconsistent with the statute and certainly inconsistent with the desires of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="1744.934" offset="7128311">I would not concede that it made a fundamental change in the overall statutory scheme, since before the 1964 amendment there was certainly reason to believe that mineral revenues could be distributed under the 1935 Act as provided in the 1964 Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. G. Thomas Koester</label>
            <text syncTime="2090.343" offset="8509875">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.909" offset="8520220">My name is Tom Koester and I represent the State of Alaska in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.429" offset="8534222">Alaska's position here is really quite straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.631" offset="8551044">the Moose Range leases, the leases on the Moose Range with which we're dealing here, were issued under the authority of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, and Section 35 of that Act provides specifically that the revenues from leases issued under the authority of the Act are to be distributed in a certain fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.612" offset="8627009">In Alaska those revenues are to be distributed 90 percent to the State and 10 percent to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.849" offset="8651982">It is our position that the 1964 amendment to the Wildlife Refuge Revenue Sharing Act did not change the scheme set out in the Mineral Leasing Act for distribution of the revenues from the Kenai Range.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.123" offset="8705062">Our position is based on an analysis, first, of the policies underlying Section 35, on the legislative history of the 1964 amendment, and on the administrative practice of the Department of Interior with respect to the revenues received from the Kenai Range.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.718" offset="8775384">Now, the policy underlying Section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act has been in effect since 1920, and that is a policy by which Congress has determined it is appropriate to share revenues from mineral exploitation of the public lands in this country with the states in which those lands are located.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.864" offset="8851975">That has been the policy since 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.864" offset="8860021">It was recently reaffirmed in the 1976 amendments to the Mineral Leasing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.970" offset="8888442">The policy with respect to Alaska has been that Alaska should receive a greater portion than the other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.410" offset="8922192">There are two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.243" offset="8925536">First, Alaska is not covered by the Reclamation Act, into which a significant portion of revenues from public lands in other states is placed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.382" offset="8966078">But more importantly, as the legislative history cited in our brief with respect to the Alaska Statehood Act demonstrates, Congress was concerned when it conferred statehood on Alaska that there was a very distorted land ownership pattern in the Territory of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.641" offset="9027100">The Federal Government owned 99 percent of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.929" offset="9040266">In addition, significant portions of the public lands in Alaska were withdrawn for purposes which Congress found, withdrawals that Congress found were excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.635" offset="9087077">As a result, Congress provided that 90 percent of the revenues from those lands would be given to the State because these withdrawals were hampering development in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.276" offset="9129604">This would include public lands that were in the withdrawal status, if those lands were leased for mineral exploitation, as the Kenai Moose Range was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.251" offset="9173595">In accordance with these policies underlying Section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act, the Department of Interior distributed the oil and gas lease revenues from the Kenai Moose Range pursuant to Section 35, from the date of statehood until this question was asked by the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.514" offset="9262620">So we have a practice from 1959 through 1975 unbroken, of these revenues being distributed pursuant to Section 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.872" offset="9303998">The Director's 1975 question focused on an amendment 11 years earlier, in 1964, to the Wildlife Refuge Revenue Sharing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.929" offset="9352272">Now, the purpose of the 1964 amendment, it is agreed by all parties, was to remove or eliminate opposition on the part of states to the acquisition of land by the Fish and Wildlife Service for wildlife refuges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.724" offset="9423430">The problem was that once these lands were acquired, they were taken off the tax rolls, and that the existing provisions of the Wildlife Refuge Revenue Sharing Act were inadequate to compensate the local governments for the lost revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.834" offset="9479854">Because the governor of an affected state could block acquisition, the Fish and Wildlife Service found that it was unable to acquire land because the counties were afraid they were going to lose money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.724" offset="9535443">Now, it should be noted that this issue has nothing to do with public land revenues, it has nothing to do with the congressional policy in Section 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.247" offset="9569506">The public land revenues are to be shared with states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.401" offset="9586120">Congress passed the amendment changing the formula for distribution of revenues from acquired lands and eliminated the obstacle to continued land acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.559" offset="9638783">But at the same time it gave rise to the Director's question in 1975 by adding the word "minerals" to the list of revenue sources governed by the Refuge Revenue Sharing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.466" offset="9690401">Now, as has been mentioned, it was described in the cover letter, this proposal to add the word Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.994" offset="9760514">Nor is the addition of the minerals mentioned anywhere in the subsequent legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.667" offset="9791234">Now, in testifying on the proposed bill, we believe it is significant that the Department of the Interior witnesses stated that this bill if passed, including the word "minerals", would not affect the distribution of revenues from public lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.795" offset="9859779">In fact, they provided charts showing what the revenue distribution was under the existing law and that it would be under the amendment if passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.601" offset="9902933">It's significant, we believe, that revenues attributable to the Kenai Moose range both in 1962 and in 1964 totalled less than $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.623" offset="9939087">At this time the oil and gas revenues from the Kenai Moose exceeded three and a half million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.377" offset="9966045">And it is significant that those oil and gas revenues were not included in the charts prepared by the Department of Interior for the use of Congress addressing this amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.168" offset="10009200">The witnesses also testified that some oil and gas revenues currently were being distributed under the Wildlife Refuge Revenue Sharing Act, but no additional oil and gas revenues would be subjected to that distribution as a result of this amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.544" offset="10078685">Well, the Comptroller General had ruled in 1942 that the Refuge Revenue Sharing Act did not reach oil and gas revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.198" offset="10109301">That was still the administrative interpretation by the Comptroller General, charged with overseeing expenditures of revenues received by the United States in 1964 when this amendment was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.889" offset="10160083">Oil and gas revenues from acquired lands were subject to the formula contained in the Refuge Revenue Sharing Act but they were subjected to that formula by virtue of Section 6 of the Mineral Leasing Act for acquired lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="2522.752" offset="10239600">And it was created out of public lands, not acquired lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.154" offset="10261124">So, under the Comptroller General's ruling, those revenues would not be governed by the Refuge Revenue Sharing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.410" offset="10290173">If the Kenai Moose Range had been created out of acquired lands, they would have been governed by the formula in the Refuge Revenue Sharing Act, but only because Section 6 of the Mineral Leasing Act for acquired lands directed that they be distributed in the formula in the same way that non mineral revenues from those acquired lands were to be distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.841" offset="10383900">Now, the Interior Department witnesses testified that no new revenues would be subjected to the formula in the Refuge Revenue Sharing Act by virtue of the amendment, and this was true even though Congressmen were concerned at the time they were considering this amendment that the revenues available to the Department of Interior to make these payments to counties were going to be insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.855" offset="10468014">It would seem that if Interior proposal to add the word $4 million a year more from the Kenai National Moose range.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.518" offset="10550666">Or certainly, Congress, if it had intended the word $4 million annually available, which will eliminate any concern in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.230" offset="10621510">Now, following the passage of the amendment, the Department of the Interior continued its pre-1964 practice of distributing the Kenai Moose Range oil and gas revenues pursuant to Section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2699.362" offset="10945951">If this case is to turn on the plain meaning rule, then it must be resolved that Section 35 controls, because Section 35 and the Mineral Leasing Act in general speak specifically to oil and gas, whereas the word "minerals" in many cases is construed to include oil and gas, in some cases is construed not to include oil and gas, but in any event requires construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.645" offset="11051172">It is not a plain meaning, it is not susceptible to plain meaning construction, as including oil and gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.918" offset="11084191">It requires a process of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.218" offset="11093386">But our basic position is that this is not an appropriate case for the application of the plain meaning rule, because we have two statutes involved, and even under a plain meaning rule interpretation of the word 35, which under its plain meaning leads to an opposite result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.498" offset="11166529">So a process of construction is required here, and one must try to determine what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.585" offset="11194845">Now, after Congress passed the 1964 amendment, and added the word pre-1964 practice of distributing these revenues pursuant to Section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.795" offset="11255763">Now, this administrative practice was consistent, entirely consistent, with the policy underlying Section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act, that is, to share public land revenues with states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.921" offset="11308217">It also was consistent with the congressional policy with respect to public lands in Alaska, that Alaska should receive 90 percent of those revenues, because of the excessive number of withdrawals in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.383" offset="11378120">And finally, it is consistent with the testimony of the Department of Interior witnesses, when testifying before Congress, that this amendment would have no effect on the distribution of public land revenues, that it would not subject additional oil and gas revenues to distribution under the Wildlife Refuge Revenue Sharing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.095" offset="11448964">However, when the Director in 1975 asked his question, whether this amendment 11 years earlier changed the rules, the Solicitor of the Department of Interior and the Comptroller General adopted the position which is now being taken by the petitioners in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.354" offset="11509986">They rested their conclusion on the plain meaning rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.239" offset="11525555">Now I believe that, as we have shown, the plain meaning rule is inappropriate unless it is going to be used to find that Section 35 controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.112" offset="11564948">But what we believe is more interesting at this point is the argument which has been raised by the federal petitioners in their brief, and that is somehow that in 1964 there was a perception that the Wildlife Refuge Revenue Sharing Act controlled these revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.557" offset="11634747">Now, under the Comptroller General's rulings it did not, but that there was somehow this perception on the part of senior Department of the Interior officials, that this perception was communicated to Congress... although they concede that it may possibly only have been communicated by inference... and that Congress may therefore have added the word "minerals" based on this perception or understanding, and the Court now should effectuate that presumed congressional understanding by construing the word "minerals" to include the oil and gas revenues from the public lands of the Kenai National Moose Range.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.932" offset="11780302">Well this argument requires several assumptions before you can get from Point A to Point B.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.918" offset="11804230">The first is that both the Interior Department officials and Congress were unaware of the Comptroller General's rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.688" offset="11835263">The second is that they were unaware that the Kenai Moose Range was generating $4 million a year in oil and gas revenues because their testimony was, and the charts showed, the Kenai revenues were only $10,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.582" offset="11890852">The third is that they were unaware that Interior was in a process of distributing these revenues under a totally different statutory scheme, under Section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.388" offset="11930140">And finally, as has been discussed, that Interior continued to distribute these revenues in the wrong way, or a way which was not perceived by the senior officials of the Department of the Interior as being the proper manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.232" offset="11997431">We submit that this chain of assumptions that must be made before one reaches the result sought by the petitioners simply is untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.755" offset="12035570">It requires too much of a leap of fate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.473" offset="12054483">We believe Justice Brennan's comment in the SEC v. Sloan case suggests a more appropriate assumption and that is that this continuous process by which the Department of the Interior distributed the revenues pursuant to Section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act more accurately reflects both the Department of Interior's understanding and Congress's understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.690" offset="12151345">If there is any doubt in this regard, one would suggest that because the Secretary of the Interior... the evidence is that that the Secretary of the Interior gave the directive to continue this practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.700" offset="12215397">So even if his senior officials were confused, the Secretary wasn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="3032.644" offset="12279136">But here, I think, the issue really is that no legal advice was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.283" offset="12309647">In 1964 everyone understood that public land oil and gas revenues, whether in wildlife refuges or not, were subject to distribution under Section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.575" offset="12374849">So no legal advice was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.427" offset="12382267">It was not necessary to get a formal opinion at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.896" offset="12396164">The Secretary simply said, continue the preexisting practice, because there is no need to change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.002" offset="12432527">Now, this construction... that is, the construction adopted by the Secretary of the Interior in 1966 and continued until 1975... leaves intact without an implied amendment or repeal the congressional policy regarding the sharing of revenues under Section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act, revenues from public lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.950" offset="12532315">It also leaves intact the specific congressional policy that revenues from public lands in Alaska should be shared on a basis of 90 percent to Alaska and ten percent to the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.908" offset="12576200">Now, in its reply brief and here today, Kenai... and briefly alluded to by Mr. Claiborne... discuss Alaska's changed economics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.168" offset="12633252">And as I'm sure the Court is aware, Alaska now is enjoying rather large public revenues from state owned mineral lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.642" offset="12679123">However, this seems to me to be beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.344" offset="12693960">Congress in 1964 could not foresee that Alaska would enjoy this kind of bonanza.</text>

            <text syncTime="3304.966" offset="13368442">In other words, Congress in dealing with mineral revenues in Alaska, revenues derived under the Mineral Leasing Act, provided specifically that 90 percent of them were to go to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.823" offset="13415880">However, it did not make that provision with respect to non mineral revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.010" offset="13432599">And therefore the non mineral revenues are subject to the provisions of the Act which allows their sale in the first place, in this case the Wildlife Refuge Revenue Sharing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.616" offset="13466976">And as the charts in the legislative history show, the Kenai Borough was receiving some of those revenues, even at that time, albeit they were minimal compared to the oil and gas revenues which were being derived.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.529" offset="13554643">Now, the judgments of the district court and the court of appeals, we believe, reached an appropriate solution to the dilemma here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.120" offset="13605007">That is, to construe the word "minerals" as reaching those from acquired lands, those on acquired lands but not reaching those on public lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.430" offset="13658297">Mr. Claiborne suggests that this type of narrowing construction indulged by the district court and the court of appeals is somewhat unusual... in fact, unique, I think, was the word he used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.121" offset="13709079">However, this Court has done that very thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.806" offset="13723812">In United States v. American Trucking Association, it narrowed the construction of the word v. Colorado Public Interest Group in 1976 it narrowed the term "radioactive materials".</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.484" offset="13786506">And in both cases it was persuaded by the fact that with respect to one subclass contained within the general term being construed Congress had definitively legislated there was a strong preexisting congressional scheme of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.696" offset="13859335">And that's precisely the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.696" offset="13867381">There has been a policy since 1920 of distributing public land revenues under Section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.489" offset="13926522">Now, Mr. Cranston has suggested that there is a problem here in that counties containing reserved lands do not get these revenues while counties containing acquired lands with oil and gas development do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.899" offset="13980125">In terms of the money, direct revenue sharing to the counties, as the federal petitioners point out in their brief, there were amendments in 1978 to the Refuge Revenue Sharing Act which authorized additional payments to counties containing reserved lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.324" offset="14041879">Those payments can be as much as 75 cents per acre.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.143" offset="14061105">Or, in the event that timber sales, material sales, gravel sales and so on, exceed that amount, then they would get the higher figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.349" offset="14097990">So they get the largest amount available either under the provisions of the Refuge Revenue Sharing Act or the 75 cents per acre.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.871" offset="14136024">But I think, more significant is that in 1964 when Interior was proposing that this word "minerals" be included, the Interior Department felt that these oil and gas revenues being shared with counties resulted in windfalls to the counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.615" offset="14190986">Interior was not at all pleased that counties were receiving oil and gas revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.717" offset="14211466">And yet what is now suggested is that by adding the word 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.932" offset="14300282">Finally, the policy of the 1964 amendment, as I mentioned, was to eliminate objection to the acquisition of additional lands for wildlife refuges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.638" offset="14347093">If this statute, the amendment, is construed as changing the distribution formula for oil and gas revenues from public lands, the very evil sought to be remedied by that amendment would result in that, certainly in the case of Alaska, the State would object to the creation of additional wildlife ranges if in fact that would change the revenue distribution from those lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.573" offset="14458793">And yet that is what is asserted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.359" offset="14473944">We believe that this Court should not construe the 1964 amendment in a fashion which could result in the very evil which was sought to be remedied by Congress, and yet that would happen here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3593.833" offset="14523890">--Mr. Koester, may I ask one question?</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.035" offset="14536742">You refer in your brief to some charts or material in the 1964 legislative history which I have not locked at myself, which suggest a breakdown of what revenues were being generated and were not to be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.709" offset="14591391">Was there any source of revenue in that record that could be classified as a mineral revenue such as, say, it was stone or... something like that, other than oil and gas on the one hand, or things like sand and gravel, which were previously mentioned in the statutes specifically?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="g_thomas_koester" startTime="3630.939" stopTime="3725.149">
            <label>Mr. G. Thomas Koester</label>
            <text syncTime="3630.939" offset="14672266">The only things that I can recall are in fact sand and gravel, and those were explicitly mentioned in the Wildlife Refuge Revenue Sharing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.228" offset="14709464">There is nothing else that I can conceive of although I suppose... and purely speculating... but if a wildlife refuge had a tourist shop and they sold gold trinkets or something, perhaps that would be included.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.237" offset="14777487">But again, that would be material not specifically subject already to governance by a specific statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.462" offset="14822418">In other words, the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 does not authorize the leasing of land for gold extraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.366" offset="14846032">And so, to the extent that the Department of Interior could sell gold trinkets or nuggets that it found, or stones, or pebbles, or shells, that authorization would come out of the Wildlife Refuge Revenue Sharing Act, and the terms of that Act would then apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.644" offset="14911129">But we're not dealing with that here, we're dealing with oil and gas, which was already governed by Section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.083" offset="14944880">For the policy reasons underlying Section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act and the legislative history underlying the 1964 amendment, as well as the administrative practice of the Department of Interior for 11 years following that amendment, we believe this Court should affirm the decisions of the district court and the court of appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="3740.160" offset="15109242">This is a part of the affidavit of the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service Paragraph 3 of that affidavit indicates that the mineral revenues generated by all wildlife refuges consists entirely of oil and gas revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.038" offset="15180713">That apparently has always been true and is true as of the date of this affidavit.</text>
