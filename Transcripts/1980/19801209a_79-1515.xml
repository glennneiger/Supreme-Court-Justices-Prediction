            <text syncTime="1414.977" offset="5795418">But it seems to me that the right of termination on 30 days' notice without cause is an equally important right that subordinates the whole thing, because it basically says, the whole deal, I can nullify the whole deal anytime I want.</text>

            <text syncTime="1472.455" offset="6025295">It seems to me that one of the other points that the respondents make and the Court of Claims made is that, well, it's very nice to talk about termination and the terminability, but that's really a wholly theoretical thing and here nobody terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.041" offset="6079630">What does that matter?</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.526" offset="6085586">It's kind of instructive... I was reading the dissent in Parsons, in Paragon this morning, and the dissent made much the same complaint that the respondents do here in which the Court of Claims... It's incredible that no one has sort of made the analogy that the same complaint... the Court tries to assimilate this case to Parsons by stating that Paragon could have terminated the interest of the operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.736" offset="6182448">But the actual facts are really that Paragon never gave the slightest intimation that it might terminate anyone's contract, and in our view it's the right to terminate that's important, because depletion and the allowances that flow from these mining contracts necessarily have to turn on the rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.539" offset="6261651">The statute has to be administered in accordance with the rights that the parties set forth in their contracts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1560.309" offset="6376695">I'm not suggesting that there aren't property law distinctions but I think the Court has said often in this area that property law really has to take a back seat to the governing principles in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.539" offset="6421625">So, essentially, in our view, these respondent-lessees are much like tenants at sufferance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1786.328" offset="7280740">And then, if you go from there and see what the lessee, how many tons he mines and the royalty that he gets from that, you can figure what your cost is, and based upon that cost then you determine what your capital gain is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.303" offset="7372691">But the important thing is, Your Honor, is that leaves nothing... we do not describe what the lessee is to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.596" offset="7413860">You see, the percentage depletion allowance is based upon gross income from mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.668" offset="7450118">So that means, what is the coal sold for on the market and what did the lessee, who had the absolute right, as soon as he cut that coal out of the mountain and as soon as he brought it in and had it cleaned, he had to sell it; he was responsible for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.271" offset="7528590">He had to take the risk of the loss, he had all of the obligations of an owner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1855.985" offset="7559415">Now, for example, you give the lessor 25 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.577" offset="7577805">According to his theory, that's all there is in the way of depletion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1866.966" offset="7603300">If the lessee sells that coal for, say, $30 a ton, his depletion is based upon that $30 a ton less the 25 cents that he gave to the lessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.037" offset="7663591">Now, that is the depletion that we're talking about.</text>

            <text syncTime="1942.685" offset="7906216">No one else, and I repeat it again, no one else can claim that depletion, and no one else will get it if we don't.</text>

            <text syncTime="2703.785" offset="10950631">--Yes, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.081" offset="10955751">That is exactly correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.535" offset="10965573">And in this case, it's ten percent, but it's not just ten percent flat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.266" offset="10988561">It's ten percent of the gross income not to exceed 50 percent of your net income after you've figured out your net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.701" offset="11018236">So that is what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.605" offset="11033909">Contrary to what my opponent has stated here, Your Honor, we feel that the percentage depletion allowance should be given, to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.661" offset="11094095">The Government is not injured because the Congress has told us we are entitled to that depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.783" offset="11130562">Not only that, Your Honor, if I may make this point, it doesn't make any difference whether we mine ten tons or a million tons, is this Court going to get into this debate that we have now in the Tax Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.274" offset="11220528">They have said, no; 30 days is not enough; 60 days is not enough; they have just come out with a case in which they say, well, 120 days is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.440" offset="11265250">Now, is this Court going to say, well, we're going to fix a year or five years or six months, is that the job of this Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.967" offset="11311330">Why isn't the Government asking for, one, legislation, or two, to put down some regulations that we know how to follow?</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.215" offset="11336303">And we feel that unless they do that they should not bring us into court every time they decide that they don't want to give out the depletion allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.571" offset="11377785">We've fought it in Parsons v. Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.804" offset="11390637">We had to fight in Paragon Jewel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.723" offset="11406311">I fought it in Bakertown, to get the depletion to which we were entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.862" offset="11422925">They did not appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.283" offset="11428567">And I believe, Your Honors, that we are entitled to that depletion and that it should be granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2839.996" offset="11495441">As I understand why the GCM which has been bandied about today has been rendered obsolete, it's simply because it's been subsumed in other authorities including this Court's decisions in Parsons and in Paragon, and in the rulings which I cited today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.020" offset="11567539">I don't think that this case can be decided on the basis of notions that Congress enacted the depletion deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.110" offset="11603901">I think we can all agree on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.203" offset="11612260">I think that what we have to decide is whether these respondents have an economic interest in coal in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.732" offset="11638383">And in our view, they don't have any more than the right to stay there; and they didn't have any more than a right to stay there, more than an additional 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.118" offset="11675895">And in our view, that is not significant enough to have an economic interest in coal in place.</text>

            <text syncTime="2893.287" offset="11708600">And then, in your view, the fact that they did stay there and mine the coal until it was exhausted in two out of these three cases has nothing to do with it?</text>
