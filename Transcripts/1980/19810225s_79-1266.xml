            <text syncTime="8.895" offset="127591">This petition brings up for a review of judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.478" offset="153922">In administrative proceedings, the Securities and Exchange Commission applies a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard of proof in determining whether the antifraud provisions of the federal security laws have been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.673" offset="214735">Petitioner Steadman, a subject of a disciplinary proceeding initiated by the Commission has insisted that such violations must be proved by clear and convincing evidence rather than by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.465" offset="281922">The Court of Appeals on review of a Commission order disciplining the petitioner rejected his argument and held that in a disciplinary proceeding before the Commission, violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws may be established by a preponderance-of-the-evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.639" offset="358617">We agree and affirm the judgement of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.413" offset="377635">Justice Powell joined by Justice Stewart dissents and has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
