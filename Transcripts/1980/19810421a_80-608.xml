            <text syncTime="1534.393" offset="6290387">And that is that the other alternatives that are available to appellees, such as placing circulars on doorknobs, or behind a screen door, or knocking on the door and handing a circular directly to the customer or to the resident, these other alternatives exist whether or not the resident erects a mailbox.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.339" offset="6378158">And therefore the erection of the mailbox and the Postal Service's approval or acceptance of that mailbox for delivery of mail has absolutely no effect on all the other alternatives that are open to an individual for the delivery of messages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.699" offset="6431657">So the erection of a mailbox cannot be said in any respect to infringe upon the appellees' First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.789" offset="6463944">So the claim would have to be reduced to the assertion that appellees have a right of access to the mailbox itself irrespective of how available other alternatives may be to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.979" offset="6512741">It's a claim that they have a right of access to the mailbox itself, and this Court has never held that Congress cannot establish reasonable postage fees for the use of facilities related to the mail.</text>

            <text syncTime="2446.431" offset="9938543">I think that the provisions of this statute which refer to circulars, statements of account, and sale bills, and the legislative history confirms this, indicate that this statute was intended in 1934 to cover only commercial material, not noncommercial material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.376" offset="10010328">I think the plain language of the statute indicates that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2478.352" offset="10066230">The second answer is that I think that this Court in the cases last term, the Consolidated Edison case and the Central Hudson case, indicate that even though commercial distributions do have a First Amendment right and I believe that the trend of the decisions in this Court confirms that, there is still a greater degree of protection necessarily afforded to noncommercial distributions: the political, civic, and public interest material which we seek to distribute, which the amici seek to distribute, and which all the representative civic groups throughout the United States seek to distribute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.195" offset="10229547">I believe that the compelling government interest, if any, which the Post Office seeks to assert here, is not well taken.</text>

            <text syncTime="2547.380" offset="10342292">In the second case, and in answer to your question, Mr. Justice Stevens, I believe that there has been wholesale violation of this statute for many years.</text>

            <text syncTime="3484.315" offset="14090027">One, earlier when I was questioned about the criminal statutes prohibiting the taking of materials out of a letter box, I looked back at 18 United States Code 1702 and 1708, which both refer to the taking of a letter from an authorized receptacle without regard to whether that letter was sent through the mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.096" offset="14185218">So, according to the terms of these statutes, it would appear that even appellees' materials once placed in a letter box would then, if they had placed postage on them, would then be protected by these federal statutes, and so they would in effect--</text>

            <text syncTime="3543.319" offset="14326070">But also, with respect to the argument based on the private express statutes, 18 United States Code 1694 and 1696, I think it's important to keep in mind that Section 1725, which was involved here, was enacted against the background of private utility companies who were relying on the private express statutes to carry or transmit their own materials outside of the mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.171" offset="14433485">And yet Congress enacted this statute to prohibit those companies from using a facility of the mail, in this case, the letter box, to effectuate the delivery of the materials they had carried.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.546" offset="14490955">So, as a matter of statutory construction, there's, I think, simply no room for the argument that letters that are delivered to a home under the private express statutes are somehow exempt from the prohibition of 1725.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.342" offset="14558142">That would be directly contrary--</text>

            <text syncTime="3611.048" offset="14597012">--Mr. Justice Stewart, that was Footnote 4 on page 31a of our jurisdictional statement, and there the district court did reject those arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.105" offset="14649257">Now, this was in the district court's first opinion before the case was appealed to the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.044" offset="14681022">One last point I would like to make is that our argument regarding the validity of the statute does not depend on factual showings in the district court regarding the adequacy of alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.435" offset="14726579">In fact, we believe the district court properly dismissed the complaint the first time around.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.371" offset="14742253">And that is because the effectiveness of the alternative means of delivery that appellees have is totally unaffected by the presence or absence of a mailbox.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.261" offset="14781854">Congress is not obligated by the First Amendment to provide a postal service or mailboxes and in the absence, if Congress declined to do so, there could be no First Amendment argument that Congress was somehow required to furnish postal boxes for the delivery of mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.473" offset="14850713">And since the mere placement of a postal box on a residence does not change the effectiveness of the available alternatives.</text>
