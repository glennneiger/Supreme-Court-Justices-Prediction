            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="138.907" offset="712557">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="141.257" offset="721961">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.577" offset="743277">The sole question presented by our petition is whether the Comptroller General of the United States in discharging the statutory responsibility to determine the reasonableness of the price charged the Government in a negotiated contract is authorized by law to examine records of a contractor's unallocated costs that are an integral and significant part of a contractor's business and are defrayed from funds that include the Government's payments under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.330" offset="854245">The relevant facts are straightforward and uncontested.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.449" offset="870755">In 1973 and 1974 respondent Bristol Laboratories entered into three contracts with the Department of Defense and into one contract with the Veterans Administration for the sale of pharmaceutical products to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.891" offset="928538">All four were negotiated fixed price contracts for the total price of approximately $2 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.362" offset="954347">As required by 10 USC 2313(b) and 41 USC 254(c) each of the contracts contained a standard access-to-records clause in which respondent agreed that the Comptroller General shall have access to and right to examine any directly pertinent books and records of respondent involving transactions related to the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.012" offset="1061031">Pursuant to these statutory and contractual provisions, the Comptroller General in August, 1974, made a timely request to respondent for access to all books and records directly pertinent to the contracts, including records of experienced costs, support for the prices charged the Government, and such other information as may be necessary for use to review the reasonableness of the contract prices, and the adequacy of the protection afforded the Government's interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.782" offset="1180045">The Comptroller General explained that GAO was reviewing the increasing federal procurement of drug products and that the requested records were necessary to that review.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.923" offset="1224662">Respondent agreed that it was obligated to make available certain of its cost records but it refused to produce the remainder of the requested materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.129" offset="1261442">Thereafter, in March, 1975, it commenced the present action against the Comptroller General for declaratory and injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.151" offset="1297491">The United States intervened as a defendant and filed a counterclaim for access to the records sought by the Comptroller General.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.657" offset="1327584">Following discovery, the District Court granted respondent's motion for summary judgment and denied the Government's cross-motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.228" offset="1357886">The court concluded that respondent had reasonably construed the access provisions by offering to furnish records of its direct manufacturing costs, manufacturing overhead, royalty expenses, and delivery costs; all of which respondent had allocated to individual products and had expressly considered in setting its prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.093" offset="1445344">The court also agreed with respondent that the access provision did not extend to records concerning respondent's costs of research and development, advertising and promotion, distribution, and administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.318" offset="1498216">In addition the court subsequently granted respondent's request for a protective order as agreed upon by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.590" offset="1527264">On the Government's appeal the Court of Appeals affirmed in a per curiam opinion for the reasons stated by the District Court.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="350.427" offset="1558611">Mr. Levy, to what extent, if any, do you disagree with Judge Lasker's conclusion that we have to deal with this case in a contractual context rather than a statutory context?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="364.003" stopTime="523.388">
            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="364.003" offset="1612946">We think Judge Lasker fundamentally misconceived the question before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.055" offset="1625171">We think it is exclusively a question of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.157" offset="1637605">First, it's clear, I believe, that the contractual provision that was included in the contracts was meant to be coterminous and synonymous with the requirements of the statute; the language is virtually identical and no one could have intended anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.083" offset="1697269">But, apart from whatever the intent of the parties might have been at the time in a contemporaneous understanding, apart from that question, we think it's a matter of law with the construction of the statute which governs this case rather than the subjective intentions of the parties, and we think that is a statement of general applicability, as we cite to Professor Corbin and others in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.580" offset="1783264">So the sole question before the Court, in our view, is the construction of the access-to-records statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.084" offset="1805312">The Court of Appeals in affirming Judge Lasker's opinion specifically declined to follow the intervening decisions of the 7th Circuit in the Eli Lilly and Abbott Labs cases which had rejected the holding of the District Court in the present case and had sustained access requests by GAO that were identical to the request it made of respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.730" offset="1895904">Accordingly, the single issue presented in this case is the Comptroller General's right of access to records withheld by respondent pertaining to its costs of research and development, advertising and promotion, administration, and distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.609" offset="1959329">Respondent does not dispute that these costs are an integral and significant part of its pharmaceutical business.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.029" offset="1989005">Indeed, it has been generally estimated that indirect costs like these constitute as much as 91 percent of the price of a drug product, and the pharmaceutical companies spend approximately 12 percent of sales revenues on research and development alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.057" offset="2053161">It is also clear that payments by the Government under the contracts in question here were used as part of respondent's general revenues to defray these costs of doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.180" offset="2097674">Nevertheless, respondent contends the records of these costs are categorically outside the scope of the access provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.269" offset="2129961">Although his position is not entirely clear, respondent seems to advance two different interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.458" offset="2158801">First, that access is authorized only for records of costs that are computed or allocated on a product basis and are expressly taken into account in setting the prices for the items sold to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.616" offset="2211359">Or, second, that the right of access is limited to records of manufacturing and other costs specifically incurred in performing the particular contracts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3371.407" offset="13642543">So, as Mr. Levy said, the competitive market would be a restraint on any holding up of the Government.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gilbert H. Weil</label>
            <text syncTime="3377.977" offset="13668874">Well, on that point, and on Mr. Justice Blackmun's question about whether there isn't some assurance from the competitive aspect that the prices are right, we can turn again to the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.420" offset="13726657">You see, this came up when Congress found itself in the midst of the Korean crisis and there was a necessity of getting supplies for the Armed Services, and at the same time inflation was rearing its very ugly head, as we know it today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.448" offset="13798755">So that suppliers were being caught in a bind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.233" offset="13813906">They would make a contract price and then when they went to their sub-suppliers, they were paying higher and higher amounts than what they had figured on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.554" offset="13843163">This began to present a very difficult problem for satisfactory procurement for the Armed Services, which gave rise to the renegotiation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.861" offset="13884332">And then Congressman Hardy, in connection with renegotiation, wanted some protection for the Government, that these things just couldn't be run wild on the renegotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.685" offset="13935636">And hence his amendment which he said, and which Congressman Celler as well, said would serve as a deterrent against a sword of Damocles hanging over the suppliers heads which would deter them from engaging in abusive, fraudulent, and overreaching practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.516" offset="14019019">But Mr. Hardy at page 97, Congressional Record, page 13198, explaining the rationale behind all of this, said:</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.925" offset="14072623">"In normal times competitive bidding generally operates as a brake on the price which a contractor can demand from the Government for his goods and services. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.416" offset="14126644">In normal times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.685" offset="14131659">So this was an emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.802" offset="14140123">Actually, this entire statutory provision was generated to cope with an emergency situation that does not exist today, which may come up later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.926" offset="14184636">But certainly as of today the competitive bidding situation to which reference has been made does serve as a brake and does serve as a protection and an assurance that the prices are not overreaching or fraudulent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.971" offset="14248792">Fraud comes in with a cost-plus again, which we're not dealing with here, fraudulent representation as to what costs are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.958" offset="14280766">But where certain costs have not even been taken into account in reaching the price, even though later when for accountancy purposes or for analytical purposes retrospectively the business wants to see how has it done, why has it done what it has done, can it improve its methods of operation?</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.823" offset="14376270">This is a retrospective analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.108" offset="14385361">It has nothing to do with fixing the prices to the Government in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.512" offset="14403019">That's why I say this term "allocate" can be a little bit equivocal, and misleading, if we don't keep clearly in mind the difference between allocating for the purpose of reaching the prices to the Government and allocating later on for purposes of analyzing the operations of the business, which has nothing to do with fixing the price to the Government except on future contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.814" offset="14508241">But not on the contracts, as the statute provides, that are involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.883" offset="14532482">I would like to address this question that was raised by the Bench early on with Mr. Levy about whether this is a case involving statutory construction or interpretation of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.224" offset="14673857">It is very clear in the legislative history and we have the quotations at pages three and four of our brief, that Congress deliberately and advisedly put the relationship between the Comptroller General and the supplier on to a contractual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.904" offset="14764554">Congress realized the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.022" offset="14776988">In one exchange, and this appears in two exchanges, and the first one, you can find at page four of our brief, where one of the Congressmen, Mr. Eberharter, said to Mr. Hardy,</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.651" offset="14839578">"Now, I would like to ask one question. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.420" offset="14850654">"Does this refer. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.486" offset="14854833">--namely, the Hardy Amendment...</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.371" offset="14862461">"Does this refer to contracts that have been made in the past? "</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.047" offset="14929125">Mr. Hardy:</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.306" offset="14929021">"It could not refer to contracts that have been made in the past because it requires the insertion of a clause in contracts. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.743" offset="14928916">Mr. Eberharter:</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.445" offset="14928812">"I see. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.029" offset="14928707">"I notice that you give power to the Comptroller General. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.583" offset="14935290">"It does not give him power to inspect the books and records but requires that a clause be inserted in the contracts permitting him to inspect. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.455" offset="14978758">A clear differentiation in the sponsor's mind between a statutory power and whatever permission he might obtain via a contract, namely, via the application of law of contracts, contract principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.952" offset="15060783">Then, a little bit later, Congressman... at page 13376 of 97 Congressional Record... said that the Comptroller General's right of access</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.914" offset="15128596">"is given him in the contract. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.266" offset="15141971">"The right is not given him in the bill. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.468" offset="15162765">Therefore, if we are looking for congressional intent, while there may be some question as to what Congress had in mind by the term "directly pertinent"... and that is not all too clear; Congress never defined that... one thing is clear beyond any question, that Congress did not intend access powers to flow from the statute to the Comptroller General, but intended only that there go to the Comptroller General such permission for access as might come to him from a contract, and that would have to be in accordance with the principles that govern contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.436" offset="15366729">So that I submit that Judge Lasker was 100 percent correct when he approached this case on the basis of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.374" offset="15402464">But I would say that even on a basis of statutory construction, if the word "pertain" is a word of some limitation, "directly pertain" has to be even more limiting, and if it has to be directly pertinent to transactions that are related to the particular contract, you have a very narrowly circumscribed area.</text>
