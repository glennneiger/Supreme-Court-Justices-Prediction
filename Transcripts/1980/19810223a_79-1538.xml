            <text syncTime="68.456" offset="417436">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="75.126" offset="444081">This case, like the one that follows it, involves several challenges to the constitutionality of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.309" offset="492878">This case is here on direct appeal from the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.650" offset="522240">The original plaintiffs were an association of coal mining companies and 63 of its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.726" offset="550556">The Commonwealth of Virginia intervened as a plaintiff in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.331" offset="568946">The primary constitutional provisions involved are the Commerce Clause, Article I, Section 8; the Tenth Amendment; and the Just Compensation and Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.093" offset="620042">I plan to address the constitutional questions in that order after I first describe the statutory provisions that are at issue here in the overall statutory scheme for regulating surface mining of coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.338" offset="673018">For present purposes the critical portion of the statute is Title V which is entitled,</text>
            <text syncTime="139.507" offset="701649">"Control of Environmental Impacts of Surface Coal Mining. "</text>
            <text syncTime="143.020" offset="715650">Section 501 of the Act establishes a two-stage program for the regulation of surface mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.704" offset="750445">During the initial stage, also called the interim stage in the Secretary's regulations, mine operators are required to comply with only some of the performance standards set up by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.919" offset="795271">Among the ones applicable during this interim stage are the so-called steep slope provisions in Section 515(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="171.462" offset="829440">They apply to surface mining on slopes greater than 20 degrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.961" offset="847516">They require mine operators to avoid the placement of debris, spoil material, or abandoned equipment on the downslope beneath the mining cut.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.083" offset="887954">They further require restoration of the mining site to its approximate original contour after mining is completed, and complete coverage of the so-called high wall, which is the vertical face of the mine cut.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.373" offset="945110">Another portion of the Act that becomes immediately effective during the interim period is Section 522(e), particularly 522(e)(4) and (5), which with various qualifications and exceptions prohibit surface mining altogether within specified distances of roads, schools, churches, parks, public buildings, and cemeteries.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.223" offset="1040509">During the interim period the Secretary of the Interior is primarily responsible for enforcing the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.313" offset="1072901">The interim regulatory program remains in effect in each state until a permanent program has been established in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.684" offset="1106337">States wishing to assume primary responsibility for regulation of surface coal mining during the permanent phase must submit to the Secretary a proposed permanent program demonstrating, first, that the state legislature has adopted the necessary laws implementing the environmental protection standards established by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.581" offset="1201946">And second, that the state has the administrative and the technological capability to enforce those standards.</text>

            <label>Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="273.313" offset="1236845">Mr. Buscemi, supposing that that statute at the phase you now describe didn't talk about coal at all, it simply talked about the desirability of zoning on a national level, and Congress passed a law saying that for any state that doesn't zone land and keep a certain amount of prime farm land in existence that is now in existence, we will supersede that state's regulatory power with our own zoning act.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.877" offset="1391177">Do you think it has the power under the Commerce Clause to do that?</text>

            <text syncTime="314.049" offset="1399849">Well, I'm not sure that I completely appreciate the question, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because I'm not sure that I understand the factual underpinning that Congress would have for that sort of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.576" offset="1453975">My answer to that question and hypotheticals of that kind is essentially that if Congress finds, and has a rational basis for finding, that a particular situation that exists in the states is affecting interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.865" offset="1527118">And if Congress devises a method that's rationally related to the protection of the regulation of interstate commerce, the statute is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.815" offset="1566929">I'm not sure what the justification would be for the statute that you've just suggested, but I think that the test would be the same as it is here.</text>

            <text syncTime="365.983" offset="1607575">Well, in Chief Justice Hughes' opinion in Jones &amp; Laughlin v. NLRB, when he was upholding the National Labor Relations statute, he said that, regarding the Commerce Clause,</text>
            <text syncTime="376.556" offset="1649893">"Undoubtedly the scope of this power must be considered in the light of our dual system of government and may not be extended so as to embrace effects upon interstate commerce so indirect and remote that to embrace them in view of our complex society would effectually obliterate the distinction between what is national and what is local and create a completely centralized government. "</text>
            <text syncTime="396.267" offset="1728679">Now, does the Government take the position that the law has gone so much beyond that that that is no longer the limit on the Commerce Clause?</text>

            <text syncTime="403.827" offset="1758981">Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think that the Court's decision in National League of Cities v. Usery establishes that there is some impact of the federal system of government, our state system, the Tenth Amendment, or the federal system of government generally, however you want to characterize that decision, on the exercise of the commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.738" offset="1858560">And so I don't think that Mr. Chief Justice Hughes' statement that you've just read can be completely disavowed.</text>

            <text syncTime="574.398" offset="2441195">That is not the sort of thing that can be so lightly assumed in the hypothetical, because Congress here, in the Surface Mining Act, as it has in the other Commerce Clause legislation that the Court has sustained, has very carefully examined exactly the situation that did prevail and has determined that particular adverse effect on interstate commerce did exist.</text>

United States, you make the point that there is a very broad discretion in Congress to make findings, and that's part of what Congress is entitled to do, and you made that point, I believe, in the connection of United States v. California, which you specifically said you thought was a correct decision because Congress had made certain findings about the impact of railroad hazards on public safety and on commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.802" offset="5130866">It is true that Congress does have an extremely broad factfinding capability and discretion, but I don't... that does not mean that there is no review whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.783" offset="5174752">There must be a rational basis for a factual finding that Congress has made, and I think that the legislative record in this case, which includes volumes and volumes of hearings and evidence of the negative effects that surface mining has had, demonstrates that there is a basis for the congressional findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.148" offset="5264195">Now, there are, by the way, a number of federal statutes that affect land use.</text>

            <text syncTime="1410.815" offset="5786853">That's not true in the Indiana case, but the district court here sustained the statute on the Commerce Clause ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.875" offset="5819141">Now, admittedly, this Commerce Clause-Tenth Amendment or Federal System argument emerges to some extent in... this Court in National League of Cities said that the statute there was unquestionably valid under the Commerce Clause, but that the Tenth Amendment or the state-federal relationship in our constitutional system imposed some limitations on Congress's power to exercise the Commerce Clause delegated power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.864" offset="5923108">So that that was... even in National League of Cities there was no question that the Commerce Clause power alone was sufficient to justify the congressional action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.282" offset="5956754">The question is whether there was some additional limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.204" offset="5960411">And that brings me to the first point on which the district court ruled against the Secretary, and that is on this Tenth Amendment argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.967" offset="5987474">But this statute is far different from the one that the Court considered in National League of Cities, and the reaffirmation of the decision in United States v. California, in National League of Cities, I think is very instructive because there, in California, we had a federal statute that was being applied directly to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.020" offset="6083709">This statute does not apply directly to the states in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.800" offset="6090814">This statute applies only to coal mine operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.378" offset="6101159">The Federal Government does not require the states to undertake any measures whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.391" offset="6125191">If the states do not wish to participate in the regulatory program that the federal statute establishes, they need not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.061" offset="6151836">If they wish to do so, they can submit a proposed program to the Secretary and... by the way, there is a substantial amount of discretion left to the states in those proposed programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.102" offset="6196035">In fact, in Section 101(f) of the Act Congress itself stated that because of the diversity in terrain and climate, chemical and other physical conditions, the primary governmental responsibility should rest with the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.301" offset="6248803">That was Congress' whole plan under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.692" offset="6258416">And the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in reviewing a request for preliminary injunction in the rule, the regulation review proceeding that's going on there right now, denied the preliminary injunction and in an opinion by the court... the panel included Judge Tamm, Judge McKinnon, and District Judge Greene... announced that this statute was truly an exemplary piece of federalist legislation because of the interaction between the state and the federal governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.302" offset="6392790">And I think that Congress has tried to strike the balance in a fair way here between the state and the federal government without requiring the states to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.986" offset="6427585">The states may... there is a substantial amount of leeway in framing these proposed permanent programs, and several of those proposed programs have already been approved, including one by the State of West Virginia.</text>
