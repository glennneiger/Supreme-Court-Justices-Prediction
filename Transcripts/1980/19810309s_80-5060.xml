            <text syncTime="8.022" offset="124145">This case No. 80-5060 is here by a reason of the grant of petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.170" offset="176704">In this case, a Kentucky criminal trial judge refused a defendant's request to give the following instruction to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.912" offset="219649">“The defendant is not compelled to testify and the fact that he does not cannot be use as an inference of guilt and should not prejudice him in anyway.”</text>
            <text syncTime="44.450" offset="269804">The Supreme Court of Kentucky found no error.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.625" offset="286523">We granted certiorari to consider the petitioner's contention that a defendant upon request has a right to such an instruction under Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.302" offset="337200">For the reasons stated in detail in the Court's written opinion filed today, we have concluded that the petitioner is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.762" offset="371055">Accordingly, the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Supreme Court of Kentucky for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.707" offset="414836">Although, joining the opinion of the Court, Justice Powell and Justice Stevens have each filed concurring opinions and Justice Brennan has joined Justice Steven's concurrence.</text>
