            <text syncTime="16.792" offset="220266">This case, pursuant to a decision written by Justice Douglas for a unanimous Court in the original and forerunner of this case, Illinois v. Milwaukee, is a federal question case.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.238" offset="274079">The Court, through Justice Douglas, enunciated both a basic principle and set the stage for the question that is now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.422" offset="314830">The basic principle?</text>
            <text syncTime="42.342" offset="322457">That federal law controls the rights and obligations of discharges to interstate waters, where the same are called into question in an interstate dispute, and such federal law controls to the exclusion of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.476" offset="403019">The federal law at the time of this Court's initial decision was common law, primarily because of the absence of a complete and effective statutory scheme covering the same subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.656" offset="467803">The stage was set for the question of the effect of subsequently enacted legislation on that statutory law by Justice Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.839" offset="516495">He first acknowledged that federal law excluded state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.024" offset="545230">And then he talked in terms of the possibility of preemption of the federal common law by federal statutory law.</text>

            <text syncTime="130.058" offset="673334">The word, preemption, is usually thought of in terms of federal law overriding state law or occupying the field in such a way so that the state law and other law cannot operate there.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.084" offset="725475">Here Justice Douglas, speaking for a unanimous Court, spoke in terms of federal legislation displacing or preempting federal common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.798" offset="776361">His exact language was:</text>
            <text syncTime="158.938" offset="788900">"New federal laws and new federal regulations may in time preempt the field of federal common law of nuisance. "</text>

            <text syncTime="498.272" offset="2146222">And Congress has specifically said that litigants may have access to the law that is there, in 505(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="505.612" offset="2175584">However, Congress did not say in 505(e) or in any other portion of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act that we are preserving and establishing the law that exists at the time of the adoption of this Act as being the rights, remedies, and the law available to any litigant choosing to avail himself, herself, or itself of that particular body of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="571.556" offset="2439316">Section 510 preserves that right to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.444" offset="2458960">To the extent that the states control discharges within their own geographical sovereignty, where they are dealing with something that they have a right to deal with, this has been preserved by the congressional Act at Section 510, and that continues on with one very important consideration that the Congress engrafted on the rights of the states, and that is, the states may not legislate a lesser control than Congress does under the Act, or that is adopted in the regulations under the Act, federally.</text>

Judge Grady entered findings of fact, Judge Tone and Judge Fairchild, who happens to come from Wisconsin, the Chief Judge of the 7th Circuit, ordered us to file supplemental memoranda where he wanted an exhaustive, the court wanted an exhaustive review of the facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2413.273" offset="9806265">Judge Tone then went through another exhaustive review of the facts where he found, one, billions of gallons of fecally contaminated water coming from this material into Lake Michigan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2452.024" offset="9961223">We have measured tests by Milwaukee's own witnesses saying, of course it comes down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.115" offset="9985569">The only debating point is, how many times a year it comes down?</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.568" offset="9999362">The pollution coming out of Milwaukee clearly comes down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.426" offset="10014826">We also have test data, exhaustive test data, showing that the dilution that's involved under these circumstances is minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.344" offset="10050457">Mr. Chief Justice, you asked the question, how did we get into this thing in the first place?</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.544" offset="10071355">Or you asked the question about, what if you'd appointed a special master?</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.028" offset="10081282">Ironically, this Court appointed a special master years ago, in 1959, in the case of Wisconsin v. Illinois, and it was Judge Maris's work in the Wisconsin v. Illinois case where Wisconsin said to Chicago, dump your sewage into Lake Michigan, this is a good place to dump it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.787" offset="10148260">It was then that we learned of the consequences of low dilution, the consequences of long travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.173" offset="10181801">Virtually all of the witnesses below were witnesses that were provided by either government agencies or some of the top universities, not based on hypothetical opinions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2516.139" offset="10217641">Well, Wisconsin's stand in the '59 litigation was that Illinois was just draining Lake Michigan and dumping it all into the Chicago River.</text>

            <text syncTime="2526.573" offset="10259437">And in that case Wisconsin suggested as a remedy that we dump it back into Lake Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.493" offset="10279081">And the master found, and this Court adopted, I think, that Lake Michigan is too fragile a body of water to sustain this kind of sewage under these kinds of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.255" offset="10314190">And that's what... let's, if we can, go to the federal act, because this is one of the things, the misconceptions that's involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.251" offset="10338118">The federal act is not all-encompassing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.188" offset="10345850">The federal act not only... while preserving state remedies, as this Court has been dealing with at a number of times... deals with what they call technology-based effluent limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.528" offset="10383257">When we first were up before this Court we had one way to handle the thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.808" offset="10400394">It was very similar to the Air Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.714" offset="10403946">If you wanted a certain water quality out of a specialized body of water like Lake Michigan, you said, let's have an implementation plan to meet that quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.304" offset="10438324">We were up here because Milwaukee never developed implementation plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.631" offset="10451698">We are still at a point where we're talking about planning 15 years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.709" offset="10463924">Number two, when the Act was passed, it said, we have had enough with squabbling about implementation plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.753" offset="10496106">Across the board, uniformly, we're going to establish a minimum technology-based limitation, a minimum technology-based limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.266" offset="10530170">The interpretation of that minimum technology-based limitation by Wisconsin authorities is there is no technology so it will be zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.982" offset="10561099">It's been that way for the last ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.809" offset="10572384">The Act, the House of Representatives was not satisfied with this technology-based limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.727" offset="10595999">It said, look, that 1965 Federal Water Pollution Control Act gave us some good remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.553" offset="10615329">And with respect to those remedies, one of the things that we want to do is say, look, if we've got a Lake Tahoe, or if we've got a "Queddico", or if we've got a Lake Michigan, or if we've got some other body of water, these technology based limitations aren't going to be enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.986" offset="10673112">I suggest, Your Honor, and the record shows, that in the ten years we've been around... under this Act eight years... Wisconsin has never adopted technology-based effluent limitations, nor has it adopted water quality standards-based limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.697" offset="10735911">And it's not enough to say, well, Illinois could have jumped in and asked that these regulations be passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.852" offset="10752524">I happen as part of my practice to represent sewage treatment agencies like Milwaukee as well as the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.725" offset="10776035">The fact is that the regulations that would have allowed this kind of process to be developed under the federal scheme were not even promulgated in tentative form until December of 1978, almost a year after the judgment came down... I'm sorry, several months after the judgment came down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.327" offset="10842490">More than that, Your Honor... and I must emphasize this... where we're dealing right now is a situation where it is absolutely essential, 15 years after we've been into this litigation, with ample proof... ample proof on the record, and the record's not up before this Court, because the Court hasn't asked for it yet, ample proof in the record for both the liability under state law, the liability under state statute, and the liability under federal common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.175" offset="10949801">We suggest that there must be an effective remedy that says, thou shalt stop within a reasonable period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.499" offset="10987104">Thirteen years is what the judge gave them, because they said that's what they needed: thirteen years to do a cleanup.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.856" offset="11012600">But in order to finish that thirteen-year job, you've got to get started now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.809" offset="11028377">In terms of cost effectiveness, let me suggest that the way the statute talks about cost effectiveness after you deal with technology-based, they said, if you think keeping a clean lake clean costs too much, don't call it clean anymore, call it dirty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.522" offset="11087205">It's called downgrading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.412" offset="11094728">And we cite the specific section of the federal regulations that deal with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.536" offset="11111238">We have a very precious lake there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.488" offset="11119075">It serves a lot of people for very valuable purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.315" offset="11130360">We don't think we should call that lake dirty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.987" offset="11141122">Neither did the federal district judge, neither did the 7th Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.157" offset="11153765">We think that this Court should affirm, with respect to the collection remedy, it should affirm consistent with Ohio v. Wyandotte, consistent with Illinois v. Milwaukee, with the 200-year history of the states' rights to abate nuisances which are coming across their lines, to abate the bullet situation across the state line, to abate the floodwater situation across the state line, for a citizen now, this is directly related to Erie v. Tompkins... for a citizen of another state, should be preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.315" offset="11290438">We think, also, that with respect to... and I realize that it is part of another petition for certiorari... that to the extent that there are fact questions involved, that the appellate courts are not the place to deal with those fact questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.293" offset="11350311">And we think that the 7th Circuit in raising, even modifying the judgment below, should have dealt with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2811.007" offset="11397122">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.457" offset="11418960">The primary issue in this case, from the Government's point of view, is whether the Clean Water Act preempts the federal common law of nuisance that this Court recognized and applied in this very case eight years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.235" offset="11470056">And that question, as I'll point out in a moment, as Mr. Justice Brennan has said, is a question of congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.294" offset="11498268">Now, at the outset I would like to point out that petitioners in this case in the Court of Appeals expressly conceded that the Clean Water Act does not preempt federal common law of nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.821" offset="11548423">And I would point Your Honors' attention respectfully to page A7 of that act, where the Court of Appeals notes this concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.975" offset="11577053">In any event, that concession is well warranted, in the Government's view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.096" offset="11593563">As the Chief Justice has pointed out, it is very simple for Congress to put into an act an intent to preempt and it did so in Section 312(f) with regard to a very select kind of regulations.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="2874.982" offset="11653017">Well, we've held in many cases, have we not, that where Congress has occupied the field, even though it has not expressly said we intend to preempt state law, state law is nonetheless preempted?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_j_levander" startTime="2886.665" stopTime="3123.601">
            <label>Mr. Andrew J. Levander</label>
            <text syncTime="2886.665" offset="11699829">State law?</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.508" offset="11703173">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.086" offset="11705471">But when one does that, that is a reflection of the Court's finding that the application of state law would interfere with congressional design and therefore it must have been Congress's intent to preempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.595" offset="11763463">Now, in this case, we have several provisions of the statute which reflect quite an opposite intent in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.499" offset="11791153">First, as was mentioned before, we have Section 505(e), which specifically says that people who have rights under the common law and other statutes still have those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.371" offset="11826575">Second, we have Section 510 which says that the states may impose stricter requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.760" offset="11848204">Now, petitioners in their argument suggested that the statute clearly was the end-all-and-be-all for federal law, but they neglect to mention Section 511.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.224" offset="11890000">Section 511 of the Act says that other federal law may impose higher requirements, and that nothing in the Act is intended to restrict or limit those other federal bodies of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.296" offset="11946320">Now, the legislative history of the Act shows that Congress was fully aware of and focused on federal common law of nuisance, and that it intended to preserve the rights and remedies under that body of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.946" offset="12008910">First, there is general language in both the reports emphasizing that the Section 505(e) makes clear that compliance with the Act is not a defense to nuisance actions or other kinds of actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.518" offset="12071186">Second, there's a colloquy in the Senate between Senators Muskie, Griffin, and Hart, Senator Muskie being the primary sponsor of the Act, in which Senator Griffin inquires about the effect of this Act on then-pending litigation in the so-called Reserve Mining suit which was brought by EPA and which had three bases, one of which was, as Senator Griffin noted, a public nuisance claim; and if you go to the decision, they say the only public nuisance claim is a federal common law nuisance claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.318" offset="12198454">Senator Muskie replies that, generally, that the Act will not affect that suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.458" offset="12218934">And moments later, Senator Hart says, based on my understanding of what my brother has just said, from Maine, this Act, passage of this Act will not affect the counts of the Reserve Mining suit under the Refuse Act, under the old Pollution Control Act, and of other law, that is, the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.588" offset="12307437">So, another piece of legislative history which is not explored fully in the briefs occurs in a House debate in which Representative Dingell, who is a sponsor of the Act in the House, refers with approval, and quotes from a report issued before the enactment of the Clean Water Act, but which was not issued in conjunction with the Clean Water Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.734" offset="12412031">This is HR 92-1401.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.311" offset="12426346">That report urges as one of its conclusions in analyzing problems of oil discharges that the Coast Guard fully and vigorously employs the federal common law of nuisance... Federal common law... I mean, there's no equivocation... to remedy oil spills.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.583" offset="12511506">And it specifically discusses this Court's decision in Illinois v. Milwaukee, the Reserve Mining case, and another case called Ira S. Bushey, all of which were federal common law nuisance suits, and discusses them approvingly and in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.563" offset="12563333">And that's on pages 6 and 32 and 33 of that report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.983" offset="12577021">So, insofar as the question of correction is a matter of congressional intent, this is not a situation in which we have to guess.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.026" offset="12609204">Congress focused, and it said what it intended to do, that is, to let people preserve their rights under the federal common law of nuisance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3137.439" offset="12702931">Well, first of all, we have the sponsor in the Senate and Senator Hart in particular who focused on the federal common law nuisance claim and said that the Act would not affect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.076" offset="12745458">That's, it seems to me, a fairly focused discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.341" offset="12758520">Second, we have the statement in the Senate report accompanying the Act which says that compliance with the Act will not be a defense to other kinds of actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.477" offset="12807003">And third, we have Congressman Dingell who is a sponsor of the Act in the House referring and quoting from this report on the floor of the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.692" offset="12843888">It's just not likely that Congress was therefore, as petitioners initially suggest in their briefs, completely unaware of the federal common law of nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.501" offset="12879101">To the contrary, they... at least some committees of Congress, and the report suggests that they were aware of this remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.794" offset="12912328">Now, the Section 505(e), the savings clause, is part of a pattern of congressional enactment, I might point out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.837" offset="12952453">In numerous other acts concerning the environment, a similar savings clause appears and this, in our view, is indicative of continuing congressional intent to preserve these common law remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.850" offset="12992577">And I would point out to the Court legislation which is now pending in Congress and which may be enacted very shortly and of which the Court should be aware, and that is the so-called S. 1480.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.454" offset="13038970">Now, Section 107(i) and (j) of that bill, which is now pending before the House, specifically states that the remedies under the Act shall... and I'm quoting now... shall not</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.103" offset="13101560">"affect or modify in any way the obligations or liability of any person under any other provision of state or federal law, including common law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.804" offset="13136355">So, I think that it is, this is indicative of Congress's continuing intent--</text>

            <text syncTime="3780.704" offset="15275992">Going back to the so-called concession of no preemption being present, the Court of Appeals does make that statement in its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.122" offset="15321654">I have a transcript of the oral argument with me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.027" offset="15333253">There was no such concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.386" offset="15338686">There was a discussion and what it evolved around was whether or not there was a so-called common law of the statutes, which is the way Judge Tone dealt with it, and the way I dealt with it on argument before the Court of Appeals saying that, in essence, preemption is not the proper word to be used here in displacing federal common law by federal statutory law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.735" offset="15444116">Rather, it is the control or common law of the statute impacting on federal common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.778" offset="15472224">But Judge Tone carried that into his decision as saying that there was a concession that there was no preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.523" offset="15503257">We disagree with that construction.</text>
