            <text syncTime="52.386" offset="350917">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.916" offset="356977">May it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="56.400" offset="367008">This is a Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act case involving a rather narrow issue but one that is important in that there is a complete division of authority between two circuits on exactly the same narrow issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.313" offset="450600">If I may for a moment try to explain the issue in, I think, simple language, the question is, does the language of the statute have its plain meaning or does the language need interpretation?</text>
            <text syncTime="94.151" offset="517996">Do the schedules that are promulgated in Sections 8(c)(1) through (19), are they exhaustive or are they only a minimum schedule?</text>
            <text syncTime="109.565" offset="579645">Is a workman who is admittedly injured in the course of employment and having sustained a permanent partial disability according to the schedule, is he limited to what the schedule says?</text>
            <text syncTime="124.950" offset="641190">Or if he can prove loss of earnings beyond that point, can he then have more compensation awarded him?</text>
            <text syncTime="135.947" offset="685180">I think that is the issue before the Court; that is the point on which the two circuits have completely disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.956" offset="725199">The 5th Circuit in the case of Williams vs. Donovan in 1966 in a per curiam opinion one paragraph long agreed completely with the district court that the statute meant exactly what it said and that no court, no deputy commissioner, had a right to give any more than the schedules called for.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.366" offset="858842">When we now come to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, they decided the opposite of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.923" offset="901056">They decided that in effect the schedule is meaningless unless the man's injury and damage is less than or equal to the schedule, that if he can show more than that, then this is one of the so-called other cases, 8(c)(21) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.381" offset="1006904">And we submit that this is not an "other" case.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.004" offset="1025399">The case is clearly one of scheduled injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.410" offset="1042953">We think that the history of the Act, the plain language of the Act, compel a finding that those schedules are exhaustive and not minimal.</text>

            <text syncTime="238.076" offset="1093631">Mr. Turner, did the Court of Appeals in this case in your view hold that the schedule provided a minimum that was payable in any event?</text>

            <text syncTime="252.288" offset="1150473">They certainly say that any man who can prove more loss of earnings than the schedule calls for is entitled to claim it and it must be paid.</text>

            <text syncTime="521.414" offset="2227031">And his job was admittedly a heavy one.</text>

            <text syncTime="536.049" offset="2285546">But he decided that he couldn't do all of this, so for that reason, because he decided that he couldn't do it, then the company could not allow him to be promoted along with the other men who were doing all of their job.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.012" offset="2353359">They could not allow him to work overtime, which pays time-and-a-half and double time on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.</text>

            <text syncTime="563.179" offset="2394111">So because of that fact, the lack of one or two regular promotions that other men got, the lack of working overtime, this man showed an actual loss of earnings, compared to other men similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.251" offset="2462342">Now, the administrative law judge who heard this case is bound by decisions of the Benefits Review Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.028" offset="2501526">Consequently he decided that because of this loss of earnings he would decide it, not under the schedule of losses, or 8(c)(2), (19), but under 8(c)(21) which is the other cases provision of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.614" offset="2579789">And he decided that this man then should, this case should then be decided under that point, and the man got an award for permanent partial disability based not on his actual wages at the time of injury, as 8(c)(2), (19) says, but under his so-called work... his loss of earning capacity under 8(c)(21).</text>

            <text syncTime="950.025" offset="3941500">The Benefits Review Board when they affirmed the opinion of the administrative law judge in this case pulled themselves up by their own bootstraps by citing two of their own opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.548" offset="4015583">They first had decided a case of Mason against Old Dominion Stevedoring Corporation, which is found at 1 B.R.B.S. 357.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.277" offset="4062499">And Mason was a man who injured his hand and could no longer work as a longshoreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.416" offset="4094995">In that case an administrative law judge decided that despite the fact that he had a 25 percent disability of the hand, that he had a 75 percent loss of earning capacity and gave it to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.175" offset="4154032">The Board in that case approved the opinion and order of the administrative law judge and said that they were not constrained to follow Williams v. Donovan, which provided a maximum recovery where the injury could be shown to extend beyond that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.649" offset="4251939">Now, to support their decision in the Mason case, the Board cited American Mutual Insurance Company against Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.942" offset="4289137">Now, that is a District of Columbia case involving, again, an injury to a man's hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.284" offset="4310453">But the man was elderly, he was uneducated, he was untrainable, and it had nothing to do with the schedules, it was decided under Section 8(a) of the Act, which defines permanent, total disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.059" offset="4369595">It had nothing to do with the schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.964" offset="4381193">But they cited the Jones case as their authority for disapproving of Williams v. Donovan, which was exactly on all fours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.428" offset="4423093">The other case that the Board cited of their own making was Longo v. Universal Terminal and Storing Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.174" offset="4466039">Now, that was a hearing loss case in which a longshoreman lost the hearing in one of his ears.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.797" offset="4496550">But because of that he was unable to go back to longshoring work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.170" offset="4518075">Again we were dealing with an uneducated man who could do nothing else and the stevedoring company had not provided him with any other job, nor had it shown that any other job was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.289" offset="4570528">And therefore the administrative law judge decided that he was permanently, totally disabled and properly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.144" offset="4601980">And it has nothing to do with the schedule despite the fact that he had a scheduled loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.330" offset="4622669">He was permanently, totally disabled.</text>

            <text syncTime="1387.755" offset="5692435">The essential purpose of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act is to compensate employees for disability, that is to say, loss of wage-earning capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.563" offset="5735590">Petitioner is contending in this case that this statute should be construed to deny an employee who has suffered a substantial disability... that is to say, a substantial loss of wage-earning capacity... deny him the right to recover compensation in proportion to that actual loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.509" offset="5811449">Construction urged by Petitioner would also lead to a number of totally irrational results, most notably the right of an employee judged to have suffered temporary partial disability to recover more than a employee judged to have suffered permanent partial disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.251" offset="5882398">Because the construction that Petitioner is urging in this case is thus counter to the essential and central purpose of the Act and would lead to results which cannot readily be imputed to Congress, we say, as this Court said in the case of Baltimore and Philadelphia Steamboat Company v. Norton, nothing less than compelling language would justify such a construction of the Act, and we don't think that that compelling language is present in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2042.400" offset="8310950">It was decided in 1933, six years after the passage of the Longshoremen's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.788" offset="8332475">It tells us that in 1933 the New York Court of Appeal interpreted other cases in the way the Petitioner is urging that it be interpreted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.582" offset="8371658">It also tells us that in the 1930 the New York Industrial Board, because they were overturning an award of the New York Industrial Board, interpreted it our way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.390" offset="8414917">Furthermore, the Sokolowski opinion tells us that the Chairman of the Board at that time was Frances Perkins, who was consulted in the course of the enactment of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.275" offset="8462460">Now, unfortunately, the legislative history of the statute... we combed it and couldn't find anything that bears directly on this point, so we don't know whether she ever gave them her view or whether her view in 1927 was identical to her view in 1930.</text>

            <text syncTime="2390.666" offset="9704008">I think that a couple of the comments made by counsel should be addressed specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.553" offset="9731593">Firstly, the counsel for Pepco raises the specter of athletes who are operated on in the same manner in which Mr. Cross was operated on and then return to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.765" offset="9792406">That is, playing football.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.765" offset="9800452">And Mr. Turner goes on to say that this man decided he could not do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.528" offset="9827515">The facts of the case are clear and a reading of the transcript will show that it was the doctors who prohibited Mr. Cross from returning to his full duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.666" offset="9860011">As a matter of fact, not his doctors but Pepco's doctors, Pepco's in-house doctors and Pepco's consulting doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.349" offset="9886760">And it's a point that should not be overlooked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.473" offset="9899299">Mr. Turner also mentions the fact, rather than speculate with respect to the damages that Mr. Cross might have suffered as a result of the injury to his knee, that his exclusive remedy should be under the schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.450" offset="9979129">Rather than speculate as to the damages, I think a review of Petitioner's brief at page 48a will demonstrate clearly that an in-depth analysis was conducted by the administrative law judge in order to determine what Mr. Cross's actual wage-earning losses were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.753" offset="10060422">What the administrative law judge did was to review Mr. Cross's wages for three full years prior to his injury and for the year following his injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2578.824" offset="10456648">The federal statute, the purpose of the federal statute is to compensate the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.462" offset="10479217">The injury is, in this case as in all cases, where there's a loss of earnings, the loss of earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.631" offset="10503877">A review of the legislative history shows us at least that H.E. 21 was in the original statute and then it was amended before it was enacted to include the schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.220" offset="10554241">Our position is that Congress meant to say that where there is a wage-earning loss, the employee can claim for that wage-earning loss, because that, after all, is his injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.497" offset="10599381">Where there's no wage-earning loss but a corresponding anatomical loss, then the employer get to share in that loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.196" offset="10634176">That is, I as an attorney, if I as an employee of a corporation and I lost my hand in an industrial accident or while I was on the job, I can continue earning a living despite the fact that I lost my hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.596" offset="10691750">My secretary, however, can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.189" offset="10702094">My secretary I liken to Terry Cross because without her hand I could say, okay, from now on you're going to be a receptionist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.170" offset="10734068">You need one hand to pick up the phone and to say, "law offices", and then hang up the phone again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.981" offset="10753294">You don't have to do anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.824" offset="10760608">But rather than hand potentially $20,000 a year to a secretary, you limit that to $10,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.493" offset="10787358">Under Pepco's reading of the statute the employee get 100 percent schedule disability for the loss of a hand and nothing to reflect what are actual wage-earning losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.316" offset="10842633">Another anomaly that comes up under the Pepco's reading of the statute is, take Terry Cross.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.125" offset="10865830">Exactly the same circumstances, don't change a fact except that rather than the injury to his right knee which caused Pepco's doctors to deny him his work, his injury was to his back, a foot and a half higher up and then a little bit around to the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.073" offset="10925702">Under those circumstances there would be no question that he would be entitled to two-thirds the difference under what Pepco would like to believe is the only reason to have the "other cases" provision in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.865" offset="10976798">That can't be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.099" offset="10981709">It can't be that if Terry Cross loses $6,000 a year because of his knee, he gets a total of $3,000 as Mr. Turner advocated at the administrative hearing below was that if Terry Cross had the exact same wage-earning loss because of an injury to his back, he gets $130,000 for the rest of his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.509" offset="11087348">And it should be noted again that the $130,000 that Terry Cross has been awarded, and which award has been affirmed, is not a windfall for Mr. Cross.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.037" offset="11129562">This is not in addition to what he otherwise would have made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.114" offset="11141787">This merely compensates him to the extent of two-thirds the difference of what he would have made had he not been injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.547" offset="11175537">Further, it is our position that the congressional intent is clear from a reading of the entire Section (8), and that is with respect to permanent total disability, temporary partial disability, and temporary total disability, as well as permanent partial disability, in every case Congress has seen fit to award the employee a percentage of the difference of his actual loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.675" offset="11308031">The only exception is the so-called schedule, Sections 8(c)(1) through (19).</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.530" offset="11335511">And as we submit, it is an afterthought of Congress that even if there is no actual wage-earning loss, that an employee should receive some compensation for his anatomical losses with whatever suffering is occasioned by that anatomical loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.088" offset="11401758">And it not meant to be exclusive, it is meant to be a minimum, it is meant to be one arm of an alternative that the employee can take either the schedule loss as a minimum or alternatively he can take under the unscheduled loss, if he can in fact prove as Mr. Cross can and has proven in this case that his actual earning loss is far greater than what he would receive under the schedule loss provisions--</text>
