            <text syncTime="74.298" offset="447508">The issue before the Court today is whether appointed counsel is a process that is due indigent parents when the state initiates actions to terminate their parental rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.972" offset="502156">The State of North Carolina terminated the parental rights of Abby Gail Lassiter, an indigent imprisoned mother, without affording her the assistance of appointed counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="133.253" offset="683341">The North Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed this decision, holding that the right to family integrity is a constitutionally protected right, that the State has invaded this constitutionally protected right, but that this invasion was not so serious or unreasonable as to compel the Court to hold that appointed counsel was a process that was constitutionally due the poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.789" offset="809461">To the contrary, Mr. Justices, appointed counsel is a process that must be due if indigent parents are to be afforded an adequate opportunity to be heard in termination proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1712.856" offset="7001735">Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.408" offset="7019916">At the outset I would like to point out to you that under North Carolina law there are two different proceedings by which the Department of Social Services makes an effort to address family problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.103" offset="7090656">The statute provides, the statutory scheme provides that the Department of Social Services must investigate and to the extent necessary intervene in those cases where parents can no longer be presumed to be giving proper care and supervision to their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.267" offset="7175397">Those cases I will denominate custody cases which in addressing the statute that was called into question a few minutes ago I will also call abuse, neglect, and dependency proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.609" offset="7232762">It is this proceeding which represents the initial intrusion into the family unit, into what Mr. Evans would call the family integrity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.167" offset="7282917">The child is still with the parents, the parents are presumed, as they are entitled to, to be providing proper care and supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.940" offset="7318026">It comes to the attention of the Department of Social Services that they are not, and the Department brings this action to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.529" offset="7352403">Because it is the initial and most, I would argue, significant intrusion into the family unit, the Legislature of North Carolina has provided that both the parent and the child be provided with an attorney if they cannot afford one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.591" offset="7432651">That is the purpose of the statute, Mr. Justice Marshall, that you asked about earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.346" offset="7459714">Now, there is a different statutory scheme in North Carolina for the termination of parental rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.666" offset="7488971">That is a totally separate proceeding from the abuse, neglect, dependency custody proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1851.676" offset="7556994">At the initial custody hearing, if the court determines that the child is to be removed and placed in the custody of the Department of Social Services, which is what happened in this case in May of 1975, the Department's interest tends to shift very subtly from that of parens patriae to in loco parentis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.641" offset="7652811">The court has given the Department of Social Services certain responsibilities in providing for the interests of this individual child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.295" offset="7683426">There are provisions in the law that are being refined constantly by which the court can direct both the parents and the Department of Social Services to work together to try to reunify this family, to put the child back into the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.042" offset="7766496">There are provisions in the law now that require that the custody decision that removed the child be reviewed every six months to make sure that the court's mandate is being followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.134" offset="7822816">Now, that did not happen in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.570" offset="7828563">That statutory provision has been enacted subsequent to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.188" offset="7843087">But what happened in this case was that the family, once the child was removed from the home, the family abandoned this child, in foster care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.680" offset="7897003">The mother testified that she had seen him once or twice, she had in fact visited with him once at the request of the social worker, but she had not seen him any other time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2994.485" offset="12128213">Perhaps I might begin, Justice Rehnquist, by following up on your question about whether or not the state could dispense with counsel altogether in these hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.860" offset="12165725">And frankly, sir, I think not, notwithstanding Parham v. J.R. And the reason I think not is that the degree of importance that's attached to the family relationship in Stanley v.

            <text syncTime="3059.509" offset="12388288">Your Honor, I can suggest a couple of possible distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.746" offset="12409291">I should say more than possible; I think they are the distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.597" offset="12420680">First is this, that the intrusion at the time of the neglect hearing is really the more important intrusion because that's what separates a child from the parent and disrupts the care and companionship of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.822" offset="12465611">That's what really sunders the family, and from that point on what the parent has is not an interest in the companionship of the child but the expectation that with the help of the state the child may come back some time in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.963" offset="12514094">That interest is a much lower interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.396" offset="12523916">The second point is this, that the County Department of Social Services being charged with this obligation to try and restore the family, and having this obligation not only from the time of the neglect hearing on, but prior to the neglect hearing, finds itself in sort of a conflict of interest situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.524" offset="12592357">It's supposed to protect the child on one hand and on the other hand it's supposed to try and put the family back together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.578" offset="12612628">And one way to keep the County Department of Social Services out of trouble given this inherent conflict in its responsibilities is to appoint an attorney for the child and an attorney for the parent, and that's what the state does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.921" offset="12673963">The third point, I think, is that very often, although not always, the neglect... sir?</text>

            <text syncTime="3657.016" offset="14778388">There are several points I wanted to address that the Court raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.169" offset="14795002">The first is, drawing a line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.552" offset="14804510">This case is certainly distinguishable from the majority of civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.489" offset="14828230">This case is formal and complex; adversarial... not informal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.760" offset="14853307">The full panoply of evidentiary rules apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.547" offset="14872429">The full panoply of procedural safeguards apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.051" offset="14898447">A formal finding of fact and conclusions must be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.205" offset="14915061">It's judicial, not administrative; governmentally initiated, prosecuted, and financed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.443" offset="14944109">The records that are used and the testimony that are used in these cases often involve testimony by a paid state agent and records that have been compiled by a paid state agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.737" offset="15017252">Likewise, you can look to each of the prongs of Mathews to find points of distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.391" offset="15039821">Under the first point, state initiated, state prosecuted, the fundamentalness of the interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.362" offset="15063750">Under the governmental interest involved we have the government moving as a party, we have the government having a substantial parens patriae interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.003" offset="15106277">We just don't have that in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.872" offset="15117771">Under the third prong of Mathews v. Eldridge we have the government overbearing the indigent parent by his resources and advocacy skills.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.595" offset="15164687">In the vast majority of civil cases, we simply just do not have that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3775.609" offset="15252772">As far as the questions as to what effort this parent... these... the family made towards obtaining this child after the child went into foster care, at the very outset the grandmother asked the Department of Social Services to place the child with her.</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.272" offset="15335423">The mother wanted the child to be placed with her.</text>

            <text syncTime="3807.061" offset="15378577">Is there some reference to the notion that she was not able to take care?</text>

            <text syncTime="3812.115" offset="15398744">Yes, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.798" offset="15405431">There was an allegation by the social worker that she said that she could not take care of the child, that members of her church said that she could not take care of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.606" offset="15448690">However, at the trial the grandmother testified that she never made such statements and indeed, that she never would make such statements, because these five children involved are her only grandchildren.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.051" offset="15514519">She has four children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.867" offset="15521728">Petitioner is the only child that has children, and she said that this is my only family and there's no way that I would give up that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.990" offset="15558195">Likewise, in reference to Mr. Justice Blackmun's question about diligent effort, the Department of Social Services did not make a diligent effort in this case to try to strengthen the parent child relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.853" offset="15641683">The Department made only one visit to this parent during the two years in issue, one visit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.559" offset="15680553">This visit was made three months prior to filing a termination of parental rights petition, and the visit was made for the express purpose to ask the parent to give up her parent child relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.634" offset="15736873">Two years, one visit, asking the parent to give up the parent child relationship, certainly cannot be classified as a diligent effort to strengthen the parent child relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.859" offset="15789745">In reference to Mr. Justice Brennan's questions about abuse and neglect, abuse and neglect are grounds for termination of parental rights in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.434" offset="15840004">So that you do not have to have a prior adjudication in which the child is actually put into the custody of DSS, of Department of Social Services, and be any subsequent termination action under certain situations--</text>
