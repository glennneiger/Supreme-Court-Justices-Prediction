            <text syncTime="18.477" offset="214663">The Court granted certiorari in this case to review two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.772" offset="231800">The first is whether a state government is stripped of its right to appeal whenever a state criminal prosecution is removed by the defendant to federal district court pursuant to the Federal Removal Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.643" offset="271297">The second question on which review was granted was whether a federal district court has jurisdiction to enter judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29(c) on its own motion beyond the seven-day limit called for in Rule 29(c), in this case 11 months after a jury has returned a guilty verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.746" offset="347679">This case arose out of a shooting that took place in Southern Arizona in March, 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.274" offset="369831">Respondent Manypenny was employed as a United States border patrol agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.054" offset="388952">While he was on duty taking aliens into custody near the Mexican border he shot an unarmed alien in the back as the alien was heading back towards Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.768" offset="431793">The respondent was indicted by the State of Arizona for assault with a deadly weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.751" offset="447780">The respondent filed a removal petition and the trial was held in the federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.343" offset="466066">Respondent was convicted by a jury and then filed a Rule 33 motion for a new trial and a Rule 34 motion for arrest of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.433" offset="506503">Respondent never filed a Rule 29(c) motion seeking a post-verdict judgment of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.211" offset="533566">The district court initially granted the motion in arrest of judgment, the state then moved for reconsideration of this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.927" offset="564495">The district court took no action for 11 months and then reversed its rule in arresting judgment and instead, sua sponte, construed the motion in arrest of judgment as a motion for a judgment of acquittal and entered a judgment of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.265" offset="625831">The State of Arizona appealed to the 9th Circuit alleging two things, first that the district court was wholly without jurisdiction to enter the judgment of acquittal on its own motion 11 months after the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.980" offset="668671">And secondly, even assuming arguendo that the district court had jurisdiction, that the entry of a judgment of acquittal was an abuse of discretion and error on the face of the--</text>

            <text syncTime="150.471" offset="742650">A divided 9th Circuit held that the state has no right to appeal when a state criminal prosecution is removed to federal court, irrespective of whether that state has the right to appeal in its own courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.607" offset="795209">Judge Kennedy in dissent found that both 18 U.S.C. 3731 provided the Court of Appeals with a basis for hearing the case; and he also found that in the alternative 28 U.S.C. 1291, which provides for review of all final decisions in the district courts, would also give the 9th Circuit jurisdiction to hear the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.099" offset="881099">Judge Kennedy's dissent further examined the merits of the case and he stated that he would reverse the judgment of acquittal and reinstate the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.016" offset="920805">Even the majority noted in its opinion that the concerns of Congress that led to the enactment of 3731 are equally applicable to removed state criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.637" offset="967303">They further stated that their decision would have a substantial effect on the delicate balance of our federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.196" offset="989560">The majority opinion vests every federal district court in the country with unreviewable power to block any state criminal prosecution of a federal removal defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.318" offset="1033968">It creates a specially privileged class of defendants in federal court who can enjoy the unreviewable benefits of judicial errors committed in their favor, and it will serve to encourage forum shopping.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.329" offset="1078062">The Solicitor General filed an amicus brief at the request of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.531" offset="1094885">They took the position that both 13 U.S.C. 3731 and 28 U.S.C. 1291 gave the Court of Appeals jurisdiction to hear the State's appeal and they further stated that the policy considerations that led to the enactment of the removal statute in the first place are in no way furthered by the decision of the 9th Circuit which simply gave a windfall benefit to removal defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="1117.903" offset="4612325">Secondly, Judge Kennedy in dissent stated that he took a position in conflict with the 5th and 10th Circuits and would find that the district court did have jurisdiction to consider the untimely judgment of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.556" offset="4663003">And while, obviously, that's a dissent and not controlling, under your supervisory powers you know that you have a judge down below who's on record as taking what we submit is a wrong position, and that would be a further reason for this Court to consider the second issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.048" offset="4728936">As I stated in my statement of facts previously, in this case no Rule 29(c) motion was made by Respondent at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.231" offset="4773658">Rule 29(c) in its text provides for a 7-day limit for the making of such motion or for the asking of an extension of time to make such motion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1180.708" offset="4863519">Had it been labeled a Rule 33 motion but had attacked the sufficiency of the state's evidence, that would be a different case, but that's not what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.939" offset="4900508">In United States v. Smith case, which dealt with Rule 33 motions, this Court in 1948 held that virtually identical language was in fact jurisdictional and set forth several policy reasons why the Rule should be literally enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.261" offset="4965814">The 5th and 10th Circuits have both held that the seven-day limit is in fact the jurisdictional limit, and we submit there is no reason for this Court not to extend the identical ruling that this Court did in the Smith case to Rule 29(c) motions, since the identical relief can be obtained by this respondent or any defendant on direct appeal or on federal habeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.626" offset="5055258">If there is insufficient evidence as a matter of law in the record, that can certainly be dealt with on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.922" offset="5076469">The district court if he somehow feels that he's missed something can release the defendant on an appeal bond or on his own recognizance pending appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.216" offset="5109592">And in that situation the case will be reviewed on a full set of transcripts with a full set of briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.433" offset="5134461">In the instant case, the State had no notice whatsoever that the federal district court was even considering this motion, and did not have any transcripts prepared prior to the entry of this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.491" offset="5186706">And as Judge Kennedy noted in his dissenting opinion, the reasons that the judge advanced for the granting of the judgment of acquittal in his opinion, which is reproduced in the Appendix of the petition for cert, bear no relation to what appears in the transcripts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.515" offset="5246787">And that's the consequence, we submit, of dealing with the case 11 months after the fact outside the time limit provided for in Rule 29(c).</text>

            <text syncTime="2845.547" offset="11522967">He had filed a removal petition that had been granted and the State of Maryland was challenging the granting of the removal petition, which did not happen in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.683" offset="11555463">And... if I can read from the opinion as reproduced in Mr. Whitney's brief, it says,</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.712" offset="11579600">"the order of the United States district judge in refusing to remand is not open to review on a writ of error and judgment of acquittal in that court is final. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.819" offset="11611992">And right in that context, what he's saying is that if the case proceeds to trial without it being considered on a mandamus by this Court, should the jury come back, "not guilty", or if he knows that he's prior to Wilson, perhaps if the judge entered a judgment of acquittal, that was considered nonreviewable back then, that the state was out of luck, so if they don't consider it on mandamus prior to trial, the state's going to have no right at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.137" offset="11705302">It's not the situation where the state was trying to stand in the shoes of the United States Government under the Writ of Error Act of 1907.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.024" offset="11736858">And it really has no application to this case other than the statement that appears further in that case which I cited in either my brief or my petition, where Mr. Chief Justice Taft says that in removal cases the use of mandamus would be more liberally applied than in normal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.861" offset="11804149">And to that extent that the Court feels it necessary to reach the mandamus issue in resolving this, we would submit that Maryland v. Soper is authority that this Court ought to grant our petition for mandamus.</text>

            <text syncTime="3123.777" offset="12635888">The judgment of acquittal was entered at a motion to suppress, which was not the posture in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.431" offset="12658458">That was set aside on appeal without any discussion of the jurisdictional aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.913" offset="12676430">But in State v. Allen, which is also cited by Judge Kennedy, that's at 557 Pacific 2d 176, there was a jury verdict of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.566" offset="12711016">It was set aside by the trial court and in an untimely manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.269" offset="12721778">That case first went up to the State Supreme Court on petition for special action, which is roughly equivalent to mandamus but not exactly the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.093" offset="12753125">And the State Supreme Court remanded it at... reversed that and said that was untimely and sent it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.356" offset="12778203">Then the superior court judge then entered a motion in arrest of judgment on the grounds that insufficient evidence had been adduced by the state to rebut the defense of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.384" offset="12822298">That was reviewed by the court of appeals as an appeal under Subsection 3 of ARS 13-1712, which sets out the state's right to appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3197.919" offset="12932430">But there are several other cases that were cited by Judge Kennedy as well as the case that I sent in on the supplemental petition for certiorari, State v. Superior Court at 606 Pacific 2d 411, where the Arizona Supreme Court vacated the untimely entry of a judgment of acquittal, essentially the exact same facts of this case, by special action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.676" offset="13015395">And if you read the Sub-3 in my opening brief, in conjunction with these cases where it's been granted by appeal, it's plain that any order that doesn't violate... any appellate review that doesn't violate double jeopardy is authorized by Arizona case law and state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.511" offset="13098778">And again, even if this Court might, reading the state statutes, might read them differently, that's not for this Court to do.</text>
