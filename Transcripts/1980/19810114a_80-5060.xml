            <text syncTime="9.997" offset="175665">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.745" offset="190712">This case comes here from Hopkinsville, Kentucky, after petitioner was convicted of third degree burglary and persistent felony offender in the first degree, and was sentenced to 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.177" offset="240449">The issue that this case brings here today was presented to the Kentucky Supreme Court which affirmed Mr. Carter's conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.065" offset="267930">The issue is whether, under the circumstances of this case and by virtue of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, a protective or prophylactic instruction must be given upon the defendant's request regarding the defendant's exercise of his Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="54.150" offset="352253">Can we begin with the proposition that the State of Kentucky through its Legislature as a matter of policy has said that no one should talk about this issue to the jury?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kevin_michael_mcnally" startTime="69.707" stopTime="79.251">
            <label>Mr. Kevin Michael McNally</label>
            <text syncTime="69.707" offset="414529">The Kentucky Legislature as did most states passed a statute permitting the defendant to testify and stating that no comment shall be made.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kevin Michael McNally</label>
            <text syncTime="85.076" offset="475969">The instruction itself does not specifically address the issue of a protective instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.840" offset="495090">The Kentucky Supreme Court has on a number of occasions interpreted that statute to mean that no comments at all may be permitted regarding the defendant's failure to testify.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="100.569" offset="537931">And the question here that you're bringing to us is not whether this would be a sensible and a sound thing to do but that the Constitution requires that the prophylactic instruction be given on request even though the Kentucky statute says it is not to be?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kevin_michael_mcnally" startTime="118.921" stopTime="131.636">
            <label>Mr. Kevin Michael McNally</label>
            <text syncTime="118.921" offset="611388">Well, I must disagree on one minor point with you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.670" offset="626330">The statute doesn't address the issue of instruction and the Kentucky court has held, taken conflicting positions on that point.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="131.636" stopTime="133.931">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="131.636" offset="662274">But doesn't the statute say it should not be mentioned?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kevin_michael_mcnally" startTime="133.931" stopTime="135.727">
            <label>Mr. Kevin Michael McNally</label>
            <text syncTime="133.931" offset="671469">It says no comments shall be made.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="135.727" stopTime="137.585">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="135.727" offset="678574">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.977" offset="679619">Well, what does that mean, except--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kevin_michael_mcnally" startTime="137.585" stopTime="300.130">
            <label>Mr. Kevin Michael McNally</label>
            <text syncTime="137.585" offset="685993">Well, as this Court indicated in Lakeside, what the prohibition in Griffin, for example, was that no adverse comment shall be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.941" offset="719430">And that would be, we think, a reasonable interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.049" offset="731864">But we do not bring here a question of state interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.095" offset="744090">And as the Chief Justice pointed out, this is not a case of what is the most desirable rule, although our position is, we submit, by light of the vast majority of authorities, the most desirable rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.356" offset="797170">The question here is, as referred to in Cupp v. Naughten, what exactly does the Constitution specifically require?</text>
            <text syncTime="173.477" offset="829562">And that's what makes this case different from any other alleged instructional error.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.365" offset="849206">We want to indicate right at the outset our sensitivity to the undercurrent in the Commonwealth's brief that somehow we're asking this Court to be a sort of author for Kentucky form instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.173" offset="900406">Again what makes this case different is the basic, fundamental nature of the Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.936" offset="927469">It takes it out of the realm of all other, we think, alleged instructional errors that might be presented to this Court at various times.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.246" offset="956726">We present two analyses for the Court's considerations, the first finding its genesis in the Fifth Amendment privilege itself, the second in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.210" offset="1000508">And while, of course, these themes are interrelated, for a logical analysis we have discussed them separately in our brief and will do so in this argument, if the Court permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.613" offset="1042199">We have no intention of dwelling on the facts of this case but there are two principal factual themes we would like to emphasize.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.814" offset="1070934">What they do is dramatize legal principles which perhaps in another case we might be arguing in the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.872" offset="1103221">The first of those is what we would call the "roar" of the defendant's silence at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.948" offset="1123492">There was a continuing theme throughout this trial that the defendant refused to explain himself at any point in the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.430" offset="1153376">He refused to explain himself to the police, and this was testified to by two police officers at trial; was repeatedly emphasized by the prosecutor's questions; and even a waiver form was introduced in which, on the bottom of it in big back letters was written, "Defendant refuses to answer questions" or something... I'm paraphrasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.014" offset="1239789">Not only was there mention during the testimony regarding the defendant's refusal to give his reasons why he was admittedly arrested under incriminating circumstances, but the prosecution's arguments to a subtle extent, we will admit, but the prosecution's arguments certainly brought that to the attention of the jury.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="300.130" stopTime="318.700">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="300.130" offset="1336233">--Well, is your submission limited to the fact situation here, or are you urging as a general proposition that upon request, upon request by the defendant, the instruction that you sought and was denied must be given?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kevin_michael_mcnally" startTime="318.700" stopTime="321.277">
            <label>Mr. Kevin Michael McNally</label>

            <text syncTime="327.009" offset="1443753">However, would we not have these, what I would call, illustrative facts in this case, of the legal principles, we would still be making the same arguments.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="335.459" offset="1477503">Well, now, while I have you interrupted, may I ask, and do you also take the position that if the trial judge decides to give an instruction like this without a request, that you should be at liberty to object?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kevin_michael_mcnally" startTime="351.641" stopTime="355.013">
            <label>Mr. Kevin Michael McNally</label>
            <text syncTime="351.641" offset="1542287">Well, that would depend on the individual state procedure.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="355.013" stopTime="356.263">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="355.013" offset="1555766">That was decided in Lakeside.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kevin_michael_mcnally" startTime="356.263" stopTime="483.789">
            <label>Mr. Kevin Michael McNally</label>
            <text syncTime="356.263" offset="1560782">That was the issue decided in Lakeside, and we certainly don't question Lakeside.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.934" offset="1575410">It's one of the primary authorities upon which we rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.604" offset="1586068">The other facts at trial which emphasize the defendant's refusal to testify or explain himself were... even the defense argued, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.350" offset="1633089">Defense counsel attempted to deal with this issue as best he could without the protection of the trial court, and the only way he apparently thought he could do that was to mention the fact, what was, in fact... it was obvious to the jury and everyone else in the courtroom... and state that the defendant had the right not to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.795" offset="1714904">He stated that, in fact, the defendant doesn't have to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.168" offset="1724413">Now, while that is constitutionally accurate, we submit that it may have been perceived as either inaccurate by the jury or perhaps even arrogance on the part of defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.179" offset="1772374">This illustrates why we need the court's protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.053" offset="1783868">There is no effective way a trial lawyer can deal with this issue, at least under the circumstances of this case, other than in instruction from the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.268" offset="1824723">For example, he couldn't tell the jury, even if that were permitted, why the defendant did not testify, for to do so, would bring about the exact evil he was trying to avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.405" offset="1865370">The other illustrative factual theme in this case is that the defendant in this case, we submit the record demonstrates that he did not, he declined to testify for reasons which were neutral on the question of guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.038" offset="1931825">The defense counsel made it clear that in an in-chambers hearing that possibly the only reason defense... I'm sorry... the only reservation he had regarding testimony was his fear of impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.830" offset="1986996">I don't think that any reasonable reading of the record would give rise to the challenge that the Commonwealth makes that impeachment was not the reason why he did not testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.028" offset="2035792">And indeed, in the court below the Commonwealth admitted in their brief that</text>
            <text syncTime="478.745" offset="2050630">"most definitely the impeachment influenced the appellant in his decision not to take the stand. "</text>

            <text syncTime="661.828" offset="2782999">Now, we differ with the Commonwealth's suggestion that we're asking this Court to expand the parameters of the Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.324" offset="2821033">We think that our position can withstand an historical analysis, and we think that for these reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.181" offset="2848410">At the time of the enactment of the Fifth Amendment a defendant was not permitted to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.023" offset="2867740">This was, as this Court recognized in Wilson v. United States, considered a protection for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.192" offset="2896475">In other words, there was a feeling at the time that a defendant if he were permitted to testify would be under some form of compulsion to do so lest the jury take an adverse inference against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.923" offset="2931374">In approximately 1878 Congress, as did many states, passed statutes permitting defendants to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.949" offset="2963453">Once they did so, we think that a... the jury, naturally, will take an adverse inference against a defendant who declines to exercise that privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.852" offset="3011100">Since at the time of adoption of the Fifth Amendment the defendant was not permitted to testify, he was not expected to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.381" offset="3037223">Now, he is.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.958" offset="3043492">And in that sense we request a protective instruction under the Fifth Amendment so that this Court can restore the original balance.</text>

            <text syncTime="787.076" offset="3284028">We also submit that our Fifth Amendment analysis finds great support in prior decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.041" offset="3315897">In Wilson v. United States, this Court first held that comment, adverse comment was prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.350" offset="3345050">It did so under a federal statue and not under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.599" offset="3358111">In Bruno v. United States shortly thereafter this Court dealt with the exact issue presented here and ruled, not as a matter of federal constitutional law, but pursuant to the federal statute, that an instruction was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.186" offset="3428432">An unanimous Court decided that.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.825" offset="3438986">Subsequently, in Malloy v. Hogan, this Court held the Fifth Amendment applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.729" offset="3470646">Immediately after that the Court dealt with the issue presented in Wilson in Griffin v. California.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.320" offset="3496978">And the Court stated at that time that the federal statute while obviously not constitutional in nature is merely an enactment of the Fifth Amendment, and the Court suggested that you could substitute the words Fifth Amendment for the word Act and the spirit of the self-incrimination privilege would be captured.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.047" offset="3567926">We submit that as Wilson was translated into the holding in Griffin, so Bruno must be translated into the result we seek here.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.075" offset="3603975">In Malloy v. Hogan this Court rejected the argument that somehow a watered-down version of the Fifth Amendment privilege should be applied to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.726" offset="3650578">We submit that that same analysis produces the result that we seek in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.910" offset="3679312">Another Fifth Amendment point that we would like to address ourselves to is the penalty theory, if you will, of Griffin.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.797" offset="3718914">The Court might ask, where is the compulsion in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="899.655" offset="3734274">Where is the penalty extracted?</text>
            <text syncTime="901.358" offset="3741170">Well, the penalty that we identify in this record, and indeed in any case where a defendant doesn't testify, is the unchecked speculation, if I could use the words of the dissenters in Griffin, what the jury will do in regard to the defendant's failure to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.395" offset="3825285">That is, we think a constitutionally significant form of compulsion... and in that sense, this case fits within the Griffin analysis... and indeed, we would submit, as the Court may recall, in Griffin there was certain protective comments by the California trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.185" offset="3900413">He indeed told that jury that the defendant in fact had a constitutional right not to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.917" offset="3923401">He also permitted them to take adverse inference from the failure, and the prosecutor also commented, but in the sense that a protective instruction was given in Griffin, this case is even more dramatically illustrative of a penalty extracted for exercise of the privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="1338.526" offset="5489807">I think any petitioner would have to be satisfied if the court instructs the jury, and I don't think that the timing of that particular instruction would be an issue of constitutional magnitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.958" offset="5531499">If I may address myself to just a few points in terms of a due process analysis, again, number one, this instruction deals with a specific constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.548" offset="5585938">Number two, this Court has recognized that a defendant's testimony is expected, even in a case that doesn't present the facts that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.388" offset="5621255">Number three, instructions do work, and it's basically a pillar of our criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.948" offset="5643512">Instructions are effective, and this Court recognized that, of course, in Lakeside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.885" offset="5659290">Number four, silence is ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.757" offset="5670679">Again, if you take away the facts of this case, silence, as this Court noted in Doyle v. Ohio, pretrial is ambiguous; it is even more so at trial, insolubly ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.158" offset="5720312">Again, the truth-seeking function is undermined because there may be reasons why a defendant such as Mr. Carter declines to testify, unrelated to guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.061" offset="5755943">And the final two points are that, while it's not dispositive of the due process issue presented, we find widespread support in the overwhelming number of jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.260" offset="5796694">Our research has only disclosed three, or perhaps four, jurisdictions that don't give this instruction upon request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.945" offset="5823443">And finally, the last criterion is that state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.786" offset="5842878">And I would ask the Court to examine what important State interest is at stake here?</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.378" offset="5861164">The only articulated interest in the Commonwealth's brief is that the instruction should be prohibited in the defendant's own interest, and we submit that the Commonwealth stating that it's in the defendant's interest not to get a protective instruction is not the kind of basic exercise of a state's jurisdiction which need be given due... perhaps it needs to be given due deference but not undue deference in any Fourteenth Amendment analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2551.086" offset="10340014">In conclusion, we would suggest that constitutional rights must be jealously guarded and the Constitution must be looked at in behalf of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.841" offset="10467074">But the public, likewise, must be safe and secure with the knowledge that the perpetrators of crime will be punished if they're guilty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2623.199" offset="10628511">First of all, it was not presented below, and after the discussion this morning, it's clear to me it's not jurisdictional but we think that there are good reasons why this Court would not want to reach that particular issue at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.130" offset="10680233">Since Kentucky is one of the few jurisdictions with jury sentencing, we feel that any harmless error analysis would have to include Kentucky's unique procedure and in that sense the policy is correct, that it would be better to let the Kentucky Supreme Court address that issue first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.827" offset="10738957">But secondly, if the Court were to address it, Bruno v. United States as I understand it is one of the leading federal cases on harmless error, and again, a unanimous Court rejected the contention that the refusal to protect the construction is harmless error in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2670.835" offset="10818996">Substantial rights, I believe, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, is the key phrase in the statute you refer to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.692" offset="10838431">And we submit that the Court's holding in Bruno that the substantial rights of the defendant were affected without any factual analysis in the opinion indicates that in this case it also affected the substantial rights; and further, that the Chapman and Harrington analysis is a stricter standard from our perspective than even the federal harmless error statute, and in that sense, since it's not harmless error in federal court, it couldn't possibly be harmless error once this court addresses, if it does, the question in federal constitutional terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.853" offset="10955146">And finally, the evidence, we submit, is not overwhelming in a constitutional sense, and indeed, we admit that there are substantial incriminating circumstances under which the defendant was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.395" offset="11005301">One other reason why a harmless error analysis wouldn't be practical in this situation is, is that the stronger the incriminating circumstances the stronger the desire of the jury is going to be to hear the defendant testify in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.532" offset="11049814">And in that sense we submit that harmless error analysis would be inappropriate as to this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.826" offset="11078966">Finally, I might address myself to the statement that the issue was somehow manufactured by trial counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.041" offset="11111881">We submit that, first of all, the Commonwealth conceded below, as I mentioned earlier, that the defendant did not testify because of his fear of impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.631" offset="11146258">But even, as Mr. Justice Marshall pointed out, even if those facts weren't in this case, they are not necessary to this case, they are merely illustrative of the legal point that we were trying to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.393" offset="11185232">Unless there are any questions, I believe I've made all the points that we feel are necessary.</text>
