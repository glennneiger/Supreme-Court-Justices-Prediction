            <text syncTime="16.869" offset="267190">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="19.182" offset="276490">This action was commenced in May of 1974 by a resident at Pennhurst State School and Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.225" offset="304597">By her original complaint that plaintiff sought damages and sought improved conditions at Pennhurst.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.049" offset="331974">Pennhurst is one of ten state-owned and operated institutions for the retarded in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.050" offset="351931">It is located approximately 30 miles from Philadelphia in a rural setting and facilities range from modern modular buildings to old renovated hospital-type buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.074" offset="404072">At the time of trial it had a population of approximately 1,230 patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.353" offset="425178">That was down from 4,000 in the mid-'60s to 1,900 in the early '70s, to 1,200 in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.647" offset="458302">At the same time it's staff was approximately 1,500.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.037" offset="471885">Of its population, approximately 75 percent of that population was severely or profoundly retarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.846" offset="507098">That means an IQ of below 36, as compared to the general population of the retarded where only five percent fit into that classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.703" offset="538550">That is a number which increased drastically as the population of Pennhurst decreased and deinstitutionalization occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.432" offset="569479">While by the original complaint plaintiffs sought only damages and improved conditions at Pennhurst, subsequently there were two additional parties who joined by intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.069" offset="612006">One of those parties, the Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Citizens, added statutory claims, added additional parties... namely, the counties surrounding Pennhurst... and in addition changed the request for relief to one requesting the closing of Pennhurst, and an order requiring the counties and the state to create and fund community placements for all residents at Pennhurst and all those awaiting placement at Pennhurst.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.638" offset="706256">At approximately the same time the second intervenor was, of course, the United States, which mirrored the constitutional claims of the original plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.540" offset="741887">At about the same time the district court certified a class which consisted of those at Pennhurst and those on the waiting list at Pennhurst, approximately 2,000 persons, and in addition anyone who might in the future be admitted to Pennhurst.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.238" offset="792669">In December of 1977 after trial in the spring of 1977, the district court issued its opinion and finding, finding that Pennhurst did violate the constitutional and one statutory right of the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.436" offset="849512">The statutory right was Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="481.608" offset="2126168">First of all, on the basis of statutory construction, and that is that the statute will not stand that construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.575" offset="2154067">In finding... and perhaps it's best to discuss the statute... in finding a right to treatment in this statute, the Court of Appeals focused on a section entitled</text>
            <text syncTime="498.227" offset="2192623">"Congressional Findings Respecting the Rights of the Developmentally Disabled. "</text>
            <text syncTime="501.648" offset="2206312">I think the most important point to remember is that this Court has never found substantive rights in congressional findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.597" offset="2238181">Congressional findings set a predicate for congressional action and for the courts they provide a means of interpreting the substantive provisions of congressional acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.061" offset="2279977">They do not create rights in and of themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.029" offset="2291889">Certainly as this Court noted in Southeastern Community College v. Davis, when Congress intends to impose rights, it knows how to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.417" offset="2325430">And generally, as this Court also noted, in Harris v. McRae, when it does so it provides funding to assist in the implementation of those obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.320" offset="2361061">In this case it did neither, as to Section 6010.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.614" offset="2378197">In stark contrast, when it imposed obligations... and once again, this is my point: the obligations in the Act do not, on its face, go beyond the funding.</text>

            <text syncTime="628.002" offset="2711729">Once again, in stark contrast to Section 6010, when Congress intended to impose conditions under this Act and impose obligations, it did so clearly, it did so by... and it also provided funding for those obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.902" offset="2779334">It did provide funding for protection and advocacy systems, saying that the developmentally disabled should have available counsel and advocacy services to protect their rights in social security matters, in constitutional matters, in the federal courts and the state courts, and administrative hearings, and they required the states to meet certain conditions in establishing that program.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.080" offset="2868045">But they did provide funding for that as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.673" offset="2882465">And, explicitly, the conditions of that funding are attached to the funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.061" offset="2900019">Secondly, they provided for certain kinds of special projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.482" offset="2913707">Once again conditions of those specials projects are conditioned on receiving funding and the conditions are explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.308" offset="2940979">Finally, they provided funding for states which wish to participate in the planning, coordination, and provision of services advantages of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.477" offset="2973685">And they say, if you want these funds, you must submit a state plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.349" offset="2989149">And that state plan must comply to certain requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.395" offset="3005345">And if it doesn't comply, you don't get the state money.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.362" offset="3017152">And those conditions are very specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.470" offset="3025616">And in addition in every one that is program-related, it is additionally limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.561" offset="3049962">It is limited specifically to programs assisted by funds received under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.793" offset="3070965">The creation of an individualized habilitation plan, which was described by trial and I believe in the legislative history as a crucial element of treatment for the retarded, is explicitly made a requirement only for those who are in-program, receiving assistance under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.053" offset="3139928">And the legislative history makes clear that we are talking about a specific habilitation program, not the generic mental retardation program.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.034" offset="3171902">The conference report is explicit on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.674" offset="3182455">We are talking about an individual person's program, and that program must meet that requirement, not the generic program.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.311" offset="3208996">The second requirement which has some relevance in this case is the requirement that the rights of persons in programs assisted under this Act be protected consistent with Section 6010.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.931" offset="3259464">I submit to you those two provisions would be meaningless if 6010 had some broader application or had any application in terms of creating rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.943" offset="3299484">The Act does do important things.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.893" offset="3331353">It helps the states to plan and coordinate their services, it helps them to work through demonstration models to improve their services for the retarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.904" offset="3367402">The planning and coordination aspect is probably what Congress has focused on most, in terms of gap-filling, in terms of the failure of certain programs to meet the needs of the retarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.493" offset="3413691">The Act serves an important purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.133" offset="3424245">It does not serve the broad purposes attributed to it by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.459" offset="3445561">It does not impose the kinds of obligations that that court found.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.459" offset="3457577">Finally, I think there are two additional points.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.066" offset="3480042">First, when this Court interprets federal statutes, I think it does defer to the view of the Federal Government, but when it does so the view of the Federal Government that it defers to is the view of those which are charged with implementing the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.168" offset="3540437">And if you look at those views as manifested by how they implemented this statute, there are several problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.696" offset="3570530">Indeed none of their activities, none of their actions support the view of the Court of Appeals or the view of the respondents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.288" offset="3596862">First of all, Pennsylvania has received uninterrupted funding under the Developmentally Disabled Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.036" offset="3623925">Certainly HHS does not believe we violated that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.580" offset="3638031">Secondly, the regulations provide no support for the proposition that 6010 is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.594" offset="3666138">It describes those, its references to deinstitutionalization are directory, and it has no references to standards for institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.699" offset="3706576">Thirdly, to the extent that anybody can argue in this case that Medicaid funds or other federal funds are conditioned on compliance with the terms of the Act, HHS again does not agree and neither do we, because they have supplied uninterrupted and substantial funding for Pennhurst.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.956" offset="3783585">Finally, at the time of trial, and perhaps even today, to the extent that the thrust... and this provided a thrust, or is argued to provide a total thrust for federal funding, the Federal Government was making it extremely difficult... and the record is clear on this... if not impossible to receive funding for community placements.</text>

            <text syncTime="1049.207" offset="4396522">Under the Court of Appeals holding, this right went into effect immediately upon passage of the Act, this obligation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1686.920" offset="6947432">It is, I think, therefore quite clear that Judge Gibbons was finding a 6010 right to treatment for all developmentally disabled persons.</text>

            <text syncTime="1827.707" offset="7510527">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.690" offset="7522543">Mr. Justice Stewart, I agree that the issue is the rights and the concomitant duties, and I think the question here is legally enforceable rights as distinguished from the variety of vague ways in which the term is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.090" offset="7588058">I think it helps in understanding the analysis to take a precise look at what the Court of Appeals found as to the legally enforceable rights under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.617" offset="7622227">First of all, it found that for each person at Pennhurst as well as on the waiting list, you have to have an individual determination by a court or master as to the appropriateness of an institution as compared to a community facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.455" offset="7677606">This has to be court or master-determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.830" offset="7687010">Secondly, in that determination there is a legal presumption in favor of community placement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.577" offset="7714073">Now, as a practical matter, the way this works in Pennsylvania is, the court has established a Master's Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.527" offset="7737897">This is not a master.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.994" offset="7743748">This is an office of more than ten people that is now operating the system in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.149" offset="7768303">To date it has cost approximately $2 million to fund that office, and its budget is $60,000 per month in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.115" offset="7800173">This office reviews all the actions at Pennhurst itself--</text>

            <text syncTime="1905.660" offset="7822429">--From the State of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.690" offset="7826504">The district court ordered the State to pay those monies and the State is currently paying them, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.095" offset="7844163">This office has an office at Pennhurst and it reviews all the actions out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.671" offset="7862449">In addition, it has devised a systemic community placement program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.481" offset="7881675">It also works with the parent, a member of the treatment team at Pennhurst, a friend-advocate also authorized by the court, as well as others, to devise community services for each individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.070" offset="7932039">They actually get a place in position in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.381" offset="7945309">When that is done, if there is no objection, with the masters' approval a person is put in the community facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.269" offset="7972790">If there is objection, there is yet a second master who has been appointed, called the hearing master.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.299" offset="7996927">Then you go before the hearing master and you have to prove if you object to the community placement, that this community placement would be worse than Pennhurst.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.920" offset="8039454">At the hearing master's hearing you have a variety of due process rights, including the right to subpoena people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.059" offset="8064010">The hearing master has paid attorneys' fees to people appearing before him, also charged to the State of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.258" offset="8092744">Some of these hearings have gone on for several days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.179" offset="8104447">Now this is the duty that the Court of Appeals found in the statute, and we suggest, every state has institutions with people housed in them now, so what the court was finding is a massive, nothing short of a massive federal takeover of the state systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.110" offset="8172156">I would suggest that that was not only not contemplated by Congress but indeed would raise the gravest of constitutional issues, which I'll come to in a second.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.326" offset="8205071">Now, the court found this mandate, this broad mandate, in the two findings of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.948" offset="8227536">And again, there is nothing unusual about this process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.917" offset="8243418">Congress often describes findings and then goes on to implement them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.163" offset="8268392">And here it makes broad statements of rights, clearly not legally enforceable rights, but it went on to implement them in the statute in a way different, perhaps, from that which the respondents would urge, and in a certain way more modest, but in our view much more sensible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.094" offset="8328160">First, as to the issue of deinstitutionalization, that is, the Court of Appeals felt that Congress wanted these individual determinations and virtually everyone in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.106" offset="8364209">Congress in 1975 had two very specific requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.667" offset="8382390">First, it asked the states as part of their plan to devise a plan to eliminate inappropriate institutionalization and also to improve conditions for those for whom institutionalization was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.020" offset="8443830">At that point Congress said, the states have an obligation under this Act, a concrete legal obligation to devote at least ten percent in 1976 of their monies for deinstitutionalization under the Act; that is, ten percent of the federal grant, and in later years they have to devote 30 percent of the federal grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.795" offset="8526899">And Congress realized that deinstitutionalization was costly and the legislative history says, in fact, we therefore appropriate additional funds so that the states will have the monies from their ten percent and in later years 30 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.522" offset="8577786">Now that is an important and by no means insignificant step which, nevertheless, is not the one the Court of Appeals found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.317" offset="8605058">However, the legislative history goes further, because in 1978 Congress amended the Act... this was before the Court of Appeals decision in '79.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.064" offset="8635987">It did two very significant things for present purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.688" offset="8650511">One, it eliminated the mandate for a plan for deinstitutionalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.810" offset="8670991">They had had three years, the institutionalization had taken place; again, at a rate, perhaps, different than the Respondents would prefer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.916" offset="8703383">But it had taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.290" offset="8708921">Second of all, they eliminated the earmark provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.242" offset="8720728">Rather, they said, now--</text>

            <text syncTime="2132.788" offset="8730863">--The earmarking funds for deinstitutionalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.350" offset="8741103">They said, rather, you've got four priority areas under the DD Act, and you can put your money in any one of these, sixty-five percent of the federal grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.158" offset="8780392">And the four areas were case management services, child development services, community living services, or non-vocational social development services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.296" offset="8816963">Without going into the details of what those are, it's clear that the states in '78 forward could continue to target DD monies for deinstitutionalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.433" offset="8853430">It's also clear that they could move in entirely different areas, and indeed the Court of Appeals, of course, has moved them in exactly the opposite direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.804" offset="8886971">Congress made it clear that all the monies under the DD Act could be used for institutional improvements, and the quote from the legislative history is</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.772" offset="8890837">"increasing the capacity of institutions and agencies to provide or coordinate services or to train personnel. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.359" offset="8953218">So it's very clear that Congress spoke on the issues that the Court of Appeals tried to extrapolate upon, only it spoke in a way that declares very different policy than others might have.</text>

            <text syncTime="2225.939" offset="9103474">Now, the remedy there is the question Mr. Justice Rehnquist raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.421" offset="9117476">From Rosado forward, this Court has made the clear the remedy is to give the choice to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.543" offset="9141926">And I don't want to look at it as a fund cut-off, because that puts the moving hand on the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.245" offset="9164705">Rather, the remedy is to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.214" offset="9172646">Either you comply with the conditions or you withdraw from our program.</text>

            <text syncTime="2292.786" offset="9370863">If the conditions are as the Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit said they were, then I think under Thiboutot you can enforce those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.111" offset="9404196">However, we don't think those conditions, we don't think this statute confers entitlements, and I'm making an alternative argument that, if it did, contrary to our opinion, that nevertheless the relief should have been as designed in Rosado.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.184" offset="9460516">Now, going on in terms of what those conditions were, if you look at the conference report, the legislative history in '75, Congress made clear that the bill of rights and the sections that follow it... you see there were three titles to the bill; Title II came out of the Senate bill, and it was a bill that had elaborate standards for all facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.363" offset="9541182">The House had no such provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.658" offset="9554347">They compromised and the compromise came out with a three-section Title II: Section 6010, which was these findings; 6011 on the individual habilitation plans; and 6012 on creating a protection and advocacy service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.590" offset="9618086">And Congress specifically said in the conference report, 6010... and this is the language...</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.415" offset="9641387">"specifies rights, requires habilitation plans, and requires protection in advocacy. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.505" offset="9673779">So I think it's quite clear that Congress understood the difference between a declaration or description and the imposing of a legal right or a legal duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.315" offset="9708992">Moreover, in the report, it talks about the discrete standards of 6010(3), as Your Honor, Justice Stevens, asked about, and it says, as to those:</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.875" offset="9743265">"In themselves we realize they will not insure quality treatment or habilitation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.825" offset="9767089">"Therefore, we have no intention to displace or supplant other higher standards either required by the Medicaid statutes or other state statutes. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.039" offset="9807944">So, again, throughout, Congress saw the limited purpose that was involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.538" offset="9829887">Now, I think the final, if there were any doubt about the inappropriateness of what went on below, Congress right in the opening sections of the statutes specifically eschews any desire to take over the operation of a state plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.048" offset="9887983">It makes that clear, that there should be no federal takeover.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.467" offset="9897596">What we have here is a massive federal takeover.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.685" offset="9910449">One last point, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think you have raised the constitutional issue in a variety of contexts, and I think that's an issue that comes up in part because in order to make this a mandate that's enforceable other than for the option of fund cutoffs, it would have to be pursuant to Fourteen and five, it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.333" offset="9997071">Now, it's clear that the Court of Appeals somehow thought it didn't have to reach that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.832" offset="10019118">Of course, this Court needn't reach that issue, or the constitutional issue, if it agrees with our reading of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.002" offset="10043778">I would only say that the law, it seems to me is clear, and we would certainly welcome resolution of the constitutional issue rather than a remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.046" offset="10075961">We could not bring it to this Court because the Court of Appeals rested its opinion on a narrow statutory ground; respondents chose not to seek the Constitution as an alternative ground for affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.619" offset="10118174">But I think it is clear that the United States Constitution does not require the states to devise an alternative system of care and to invoke any such requirement as the least restrictive alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.755" offset="10170733">In 1970, in State v. Sanchez, this Court dismissed for want of a substantial federal question that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.471" offset="10197587">No federal district court... and the Court is aware that federal district courts have been active in this area... no federal district court has ever upheld a right to create alternative facilities for the mentally ill or the mentally retarded in a disputed case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.684" offset="10262475">It has never happened, and as I say, this Court has summarily rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.246" offset="10272715">So I think this Court, if it deems it appropriate, has to reach an issue, can go right ahead to each issue, and we welcome resolution of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.069" offset="10304062">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="2555.761" offset="10422762">The monumental inhumanity of our nation's institutions for the retarded cannot be encompassed in any recital of the abuse and neglect which the lower courts found at Pennhurst.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.631" offset="10478246">Because the enforced inactivity, the unbroken aloneness, pale beside the central fact that brings us to this court, and that fact is the affirmative regression and harms caused to people at Pennhurst xx but the fact that people at Pennhurst there for retardation habilitation go backwards; people became more retarded.</text>

            <text syncTime="3858.521" offset="15633877">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.191" offset="15648506">While many members of the Court have addressed questions to my colleagues about the extent to which the DD Act and the rights recognized under 6010 flow from the Constitution, particularly the Fourteenth Amendment and Section 5, it is the position of the United States that insofar as this particular case is concerned the spending power is the only issue before the Court, and there is no reason to address the extent to which Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment might justify the affording of the rights that are contained in 6010.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.379" offset="15797299">Congress passed the DD Act because it wanted to insure that federal funds were not used to maintain developmentally disabled persons in custodial institutions under conditions that produced regression and brought affirmative harm to such persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.216" offset="15868561">It decided upon the course that it took in 1975 based upon over a decade of efforts to encourage, if you will, the states and recipients of federal funds to move toward deinstitutionalization, to move toward community habilitation of people otherwise institutionalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.646" offset="15946302">The thrust of 6010 can be understood, we submit, only by looking at the legislative history, looking at what the two houses of Congress initially attempted to achieve and how the compromise that produced the DD Act came about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.388" offset="16025296">The Senate in 1974 and '75 was concerned with the extent to which people in institutions like Pennhurst were having their rights, both constitutional and civil rights, violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3971.444" offset="16085482">It made these determinations based upon court decisions such as Judge Johnson's decision in the Wyatt series of cases, decisions with respect to Willowbrook, and other institutions around the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.704" offset="16138563">It also had legislative hearings and debates that focused on this question of the rights of people in institutions and how they could be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.935" offset="16175448">The Senate bill ultimately contained the section called Title II, and it was entitled, the bill of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.808" offset="16202929">It contained detailed specifications with respect to standards for the provision of care, not only to the institutionalized, but to people in community-based services for the developmentally disabled as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="4014.723" offset="16258622">This section, Title II, called 400 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.033" offset="16283908">The House version, in contrast, was very consistent with what Congress had done in the past, since 1963, in response to a message from President John Kennedy that there was a need to move away from institutionalization of mentally retarded people to community treatment in which, essentially, what the Government did was provide funds to the states that they were willing to accept certain conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4047.241" offset="16388712">It was clear that if those conditions were not met, then the funds would be cut off.</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.350" offset="16409192">So this focus was on how to provide additional funds and how to insure that those funds provided under the DD Act would be adequately utilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="4062.001" offset="16447748">But I think the legislative history reflects the fact that both houses were concerned about conditions in institutions where individuals were subjected to inhumane conditions and nonhabilitative situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4077.901" offset="16511383">In reviewing the legislative history of the DD Act, one need only substitute the name IQ points instead of gaining IQ points by being institutionalized, and where they are--</text>

            <text syncTime="4148.341" offset="16793087">There have been efforts since 1950 to paint up and fix up Pennhurst, but as the experts and other observers who testified in this case revealed, there is something about that isolated congregate facility that tends to produce the conditions that time and time again were found by people who visited Pennhurst.</text>

            <text syncTime="4172.285" offset="16888904">The point I was inquiring about was, what is there in the record to demonstrate that a particular patient who has suffered regression, may not have suffered that same regression if they had stayed at home, or been somewhere else?</text>

            <text syncTime="4190.090" offset="16960062">--I think there is evidence in this record, Your Honor, that the fact that people in Pennhurst were not cared for, were not attended to, produced the type of regression that they experienced.</text>
            <text syncTime="4201.538" offset="17005933">There were children who went into Pennhurst who were able to say a few words before they went there and when their parents came to visit them a couple of weeks or a couple of months later, they could not speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="4213.174" offset="17052431">There were children who could walk who were left in positions on the floor such that their limbs atrophied.</text>
            <text syncTime="4218.906" offset="17075418">That was caused by Pennhurst.</text>
            <text syncTime="4220.453" offset="17081583">Those people were able to function, they were able to do very rudimentary reasoning steps that no longer were available to them after they were in Pennhurst for awhile, and of course the physical harm that people suffered was clearly the result of the institution... bitings, attacks by inmates, by persons in the institution upon other persons, by staff upon the residents, these were things that were produced by the institutionalization, not a natural consequence of the lack of development of those persons in Pennhurst.</text>
            <text syncTime="4255.220" offset="17220659">The record reflects that had they stayed at home they probably would have been in better position now than they have been after, as the record shows, an average of 21 years in an institution.</text>

            <text syncTime="4291.392" offset="17365273">And if I may emphasize, Mr. Chief Justice, we are not here urging this Court, or in fact the lower courts, to make policy determinations, to make technical medical determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4305.121" offset="17420235">What we argue before the Court is that Congress made these determinations after over a decade of considering these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.588" offset="17450119">After some four years of hearings about conditions in these institutions, it had reached the judgment that something more than providing funds had to be done by the Congress, there had to be an affirmative effort to protect the rights of people who were found in institutions like Pennhurst.</text>

            <text syncTime="4778.758" offset="19314739">In many instances the preferable approach would be to go to court to try to establish the rights and get specific performance, if you will, as opposed to going through a process that would cut off the funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="4809.919" offset="19439396">The Senate wanted to cut off all federal funds if there were not compliance with the 400 pages of detailed standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="4818.932" offset="19475445">The compromise is, cut off funds that flow to the recipient under the DD Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="4902.195" offset="19808558">If there is noncompliance, the funds are cut off.</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.757" offset="19814723">And that's what happens if funds are flowing under the DD Act, or if they cease to flow.</text>

            <text syncTime="5283.806" offset="21334945">This is a case of statutory construction at each point dispositive of the issues here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5290.694" offset="21362530">The Congress having studied over 12 years, from 1963, and then intensively over four legislative years, 1972 to 1975, came to certain conclusions about the situation of severely retarded people, about their human possibilities, about the necessary conditions for realizing those possibilities, and about the persistent destruction large isolated institutions impose upon retarded people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5319.277" offset="21476842">6010 is both a deinstitutionalization statute and an anti-dumping statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5327.399" offset="21509338">What is required in the statutory language are residential programs designed to maximize developmental potential and in the least restrictive setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5339.629" offset="21558240">The states must move severely retarded people out of large isolated institutions and, more, they must provide structured habilitative residential programs in their stead.</text>
            <text syncTime="5352.637" offset="21610276">The Congress did not leave the states naked in the face of this duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5356.418" offset="21625427">The Congress, as my colleagues have adverted, was aware, and indeed legislated with particular awareness that there were massive amounts of federal funds being spent upon residential facilities and for retardation services, and they legislated to redirect those funds as well as the state funds being so spent to community care.</text>
            <text syncTime="5381.736" offset="21726677">Mr. Justice Powell, Justice Stewart, the Congress used the phrase, 6010.</text>
            <text syncTime="5391.701" offset="21766592">And whenever the Congress has used that phrase, rather than "federal financial assistance", it has done so advisedly to reach both the full run of relevant federal funding strings, and state and local funds as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="5405.382" offset="21821241">It comes, Justice White, perhaps more easily to my lips than to General Days', to point out that the Congress was moved in significant part to act in Section 6010 because of its impatience with the federal executive's actions with respect to these institutions.</text>

            <text syncTime="5640.648" offset="22762380">It was not a new fact; it was quite an old one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5643.475" offset="22773665">The Congress found that fact as a predicate for acting in 6010, as in the related statutes of the early 1970s.</text>
            <text syncTime="5652.548" offset="22809923">The situation, therefore, as the congressional judgment again indicates, is that the choice is no longer warehousing on the one hand, of severely retarded people, or on the other, imposing damage upon families.</text>
            <text syncTime="5669.776" offset="22878886">There is a third choice, which affirms the humanity and citizenship of retarded people, and it is the choice which the Congress required the states to make in Section 6010, namely: to provide habilitating residential programs.</text>

            <text syncTime="6426.016" offset="25903761">That takes me back to what I think the starting point is, and I think it was not fully addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6433.998" offset="25935735">I am reminded of Professor Cox's statement when one talks about the right to appropriate treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6440.885" offset="25963321">I was thinking, as I listened to the argument today, that right, once loosed, is not easily cabined.</text>
            <text syncTime="6446.680" offset="25986413">And of course the respondent would fill it up in a way that suits their view of the state of the art, or the current knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="6454.271" offset="26016819">I think Congress was much more specific in how it did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6458.052" offset="26031970">Two critical points: nowhere in the legislative history or in the Act is there empower of federal court to make individualized determinations and nowhere does it require a legal presumption of deinstitutionalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="6470.311" offset="26080976">To the extent that Pennhurst is deficient... and every institution, of course, will have deficiencies; I think we live in the real world... Pennhurst should be improved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6480.057" offset="26119951">But I think a very telling point has been omitted by my colleagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="6483.853" offset="26135206">They have a philosophy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6485.055" offset="26140013">I represent the parents, virtually all the parents and the guardians of people at the facilities who are strongly opposed to deinstitutionalization for the very severely and profoundly retarded people.</text>

            <text syncTime="6505.859" offset="26223187">The organization has most of the parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="6508.515" offset="26233845">One small point: the named plaintiff in the case withdrew from this case precisely because she opposed the philosophy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6514.949" offset="26259549">But the key point is that these parents, despite the shortcomings of Pennhurst... and Lord knows, they'd like to see them improved... they want to have their children remain there, their adult children even.</text>
            <text syncTime="6525.633" offset="26302285">And these people are being put through, under this statute, lengthy hearings to defend their philosophy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6533.474" offset="26333632">I suggest there is no way that Congress has the power to force them to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="6551.669" offset="26406462">The United States Courts of Appeals were split at the time over the standing of the United States to participate... United States v. Solomon, United States v. Mattson... had rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6561.774" offset="26446795">The 3rd Circuit upheld it as a general enforcement provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6565.116" offset="26460170">To some degree, on a going forward basis, Your Honor, the issue is moot because Congress has passed a statute authorizing the United States in the future to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6574.144" offset="26496323">And the issue was raised by the State of Pennsylvania in its petition for certiorari in this Court's finding.</text>
