            <text syncTime="13.042" offset="194040">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.620" offset="204280">This case is here on the government's petition to review a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.507" offset="231866">The single question presented is whether Border Patrol officers have founded suspicion to stop the camper in which Respondents were traveling during the early morning hours of January 31st, 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.784" offset="284947">Respondents were indicted in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona on six counts of knowingly transporting illegal aliens, in violation of 8 U.S.C. 1324(a)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="48.825" offset="337191">Both Respondents moved to suppress the fruits of the search of the camper in which they were apprehended, on the ground that the initial stop of the vehicle was not supported by founded suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.570" offset="380137">The evidence derived from the stop included the illegal aliens themselves, their testimony, a flashlight, and the physical evidence of a Chevron design on the soles of the shoes worn by Respondent, Hernandez-Loera.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.643" offset="436457">The District Court denied the motion to suppress, and both Respondents were found guilty on all counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.829" offset="461116">The Court of Appeals reversed the conviction on the grounds that the Border Patrol officers did not have founded suspicion to stop Respondents' camper.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.808" offset="493090">In our view, the stop at issue was the culmination of brilliant detective work on the part of the Border Patrol officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.260" offset="522870">In holding that the fruits of that stop should have been suppressed, the Court of Appeals departed egregiously from this Court's holding that an articulable founded suspicion justifies the minimal intrusion upon the right to travel, that is occasioned by a roving Border Patrol stop of a vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.971" offset="593714">Because the question of whether founded suspicion exists is a fact-bound one, I shall begin by describing the facts of this case in some detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.202" offset="626628">For some months prior to the stop at issue, Border Patrol officers had been investigating groups of footprints leading from the Mexican border north to Route 86, an east-west highway running generally parallel to the Mexican border and at a distance of between 25 and 50 miles from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.726" offset="704787">The footprints followed roughly the same 27-mile path, through a sparsely populated desert area known to be heavily used by aliens illegally entering the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.987" offset="745747">The tracks would reach Route 86, around mile post 119, and then continue eastward for three miles, to mile post 122, where they disappeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.764" offset="788901">The groups contained between 7 and 18 pairs of footprints, and in each group there recurred the shoeprint of a distinctive Chevron design.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.056" offset="826099">That is the front part of the sole containing 8 forward-pointing V's and the back, the heel, contained 4 backward-pointing V's.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.147" offset="858387">The Chevron design appeared to be the lead print in each group, and Border Patrol officers in the area concluded that a person, whom they called the Chevron, was guiding groups of aliens across the Mexican border and north to a pick-up point on Route 86.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.015" offset="917946">In fact, a group of illegal aliens that were previously apprehended had identified Respondent Hernandez-Loera as the wearer of the Chevron-soled shoes and as the man who was to guide them to meet a smuggler off Route 86.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.448" offset="971653">Border Patrol officer Wayne Gray, who participated in the stop of Respondents' camper on January 31st, himself had tracked the footprints from mile post 119 to mile post 122 on January 4th, and all the way from the Mexican border to mile post 122, on January 16th.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.143" offset="1050439">From the physical attributes of the footprints, the officers were able to make several deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.922" offset="1073531">They concluded that Chevron traveled on or near weekends, that he and the aliens he led walked in darkness, from shortly after beginning their journey; that it took them from 8 to 12 hours to reach the highway, and that they were met there by a camper, van, or similar vehicle that could hold a large number of people without arousing suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.664" offset="1156496">The officers also knew that overland border crossings generally are made in good weather.</text>

            <text syncTime="432.373" offset="1871311">The soles of the shoes Respondent Hernandez-Loera was wearing bore the distinctive Chevron design.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.339" offset="1895239">The Court of Appeals appeared to accept the facts I have outlined, but nonetheless held that they did not establish founded suspicion to stop Respondents' camper.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.132" offset="1938393">According to the Court of Appeals, the only suspicious fact connected with the camper was its passing the officers heading west and returning past them heading east in the pre-dawn hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.502" offset="1983846">That fact, the Court held, was consistent with too many innocent explanations to make the officers' suspicions reasonably warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.171" offset="2010491">In the first place, a possible innocent explanation does not preclude the existence of founded suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.966" offset="2037763">After all, if an innocent explanation were less likely than a guilty one there would be probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.385" offset="2059392">But more important for the purpose of the present case, in holding as it did, the Court of Appeals completely ignored all of the clues and inferences that were available to the officers from their extensive investigation of previous illegal border crossings led by Respondent Hernandez-Loera.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.957" offset="2129714">There is nothing in the prior decisions of this Court that supports the distinctions drawn by the Court of Appeals between, on the one hand suspicious characteristics of an individual or vehicle directly observable at the time of apprehension and on the other hand, physical clues left by a suspect at the scene of his prior offenses, indicative of a very specific modus operandi.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.900" offset="2221456">Beginning with Terry v. Ohio, this Court has established that where the founded suspicion justifying an investigative stop exists depends on the totality of the circumstances of which an officer is cognizant.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.161" offset="2274537">Indeed, it could hardly be otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.551" offset="2284045">Because almost any characteristic of a vehicle or person that in isolation may seem entirely innocent, when viewed together with other circumstances may be quite indicative of criminal activity and the converse is also true.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.905" offset="2333469">In Adams v. Williams, this Court upheld an investigatory stop based on a tip from an informant who had provided information in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.823" offset="2369100">This case made clear that information need be of no particular type in order to serve as the basis for founded suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.570" offset="2400133">As the Court stated</text>
            <text syncTime="565.414" offset="2403477">"informant's tip, like all other clues and evidence coming to a policeman on the scene, vary greatly in their value and reliability. "</text>
            <text syncTime="575.362" offset="2443288">"One simple rule will not cover every situation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="578.767" offset="2456871">"In United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, in which this Court applied the founded suspicion test to investigatory stops by roving Border Patrols makes clear that it is the totality of circumstances that controls in this context as well. "</text>
            <text syncTime="593.980" offset="2517789">Or if the founded suspicion test were to require that some aspect of a vehicle or its occupants in and of itself warrants suspicion, the following factors listed by the Court in Brignoni-Ponce would be irrelevant or superfluous, in this case, the Court said that officers may consider the characteristics of the area in which they encounter a vehicle, its proximity to the border, the usual patterns of traffic on the particular road, and previous experience with alien traffic are all relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.498" offset="2647879">They also may consider information about recent illegal border crossings in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.340" offset="2667209">All of these factors were present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.729" offset="2680793">The country involved was sparsely populated desert terrain, the Mexican border was located approximately 25 miles from the pick-up point and 50 miles from the point of apprehension.</text>

            <text syncTime="691.722" offset="2908685">In Brignoni-Ponce the Court also listed factors concerning the driver's behavior and the appearance of the vehicle and its occupants.</text>

            <text syncTime="972.312" offset="4031115">Brignoni-Ponce controls the present case and it requires reversal of the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.498" offset="4055879">What occurred in the present case is detective work of the highest caliber which should be encouraged and not disparaged by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.119" offset="4090360">The Court of Appeals here denigrated the officers' actions in this case as being based solely on a profile.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.945" offset="4113662">While we certainly do not eschew the use of profiles in appropriate circumstances... no profile, as that term is commonly used, was employed by the officers in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.442" offset="4155667">A profile is a set of typical characteristics of a certain type of criminal, such as an airplane hi-jacker or a drug courier, that is developed by law enforcement agents on the basis of their pooled experience with large numbers of criminals of a particular sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.574" offset="4220137">In contrast, in the present case, Border Patrol officers discerned the modus operandi of their particular suspect, the Chevron, not from their prior general experience of alien smuggling, in large part, but from the physical clues left at the scene of Respondent Hernandez-Loera's previous journey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.818" offset="4297146">To find clues and deduce them in identifying features of the culprit is the essence of good detective work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.455" offset="4323686">While there may be a question of semantics, but certainly none of substance, as to whether the identification of a suspect's individualized modus operandi may constitute a profile, there is no question but that such a profile represents precisely the kind of rational assessment of the likelihood of criminal activity that the Fourth Amendment demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.727" offset="4412711">Contrary to the Court of Appeals suggestion, it is exactly this type of reasoned investigative work that diminishes the number of police intrusions based on unarticulated hunches or random guesswork.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.316" offset="4459105">And finally, with respect to the quantity of evidence necessary to establish founded suspicion, we submit that the present case is at the far end of the continuum from what was present in Brignoni-Ponce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.842" offset="4513231">In that case, in which this Court suppressed the fruits of the stop, the only basis for the stop was the occupant's apparent Mexican ancestry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.058" offset="4546040">Here on the other hand, the officers had all the clues and inferences arising from them that I have described, which were corroborated when Respondents' camper passed the officers heading west and then backtracked past them, heading east, during the early morning hours of January 31st.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.160" offset="4610511">As I stated, in our view these facts provided not only founded suspicion but probable cause as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.721" offset="4636738">Of course this Court need not reach the question of whether there was probable cause, but for the guidance of the lower federal courts and of law enforcement officers in the field, we submit that the facts possessed by the officers in this case are far above the minimum necessary to justify an investigatory stop of the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.008" offset="4713851">Unless there are further questions I'd like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1242.953" offset="5113629">The manner in which any seizure by a police officer is evaluated, is done by the Court, because the Court has a very important function in these types of cases.</text>
