            <text syncTime="77.674" offset="402726">This is an appeal brought as a result of a conflict in the interpretation of part of a federal -- federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.768" offset="439089">The conflict arises in the application of Section 933 (b) of an Act known as the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.076" offset="484333">This Act was last amended by Congress in 1972 at which time Section 933 (b) was not amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.898" offset="531667">Section 933 (b) was last amended in 1959 at which time it was amended to give the longshoreman an additional six months period to sue from the date of a formal award in compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="158.303" offset="725286">It is our -- it is our view in all three of these cases, there was never an order which triggered this mechanism, but that was not one of the points that we were given certiorari on.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.482" offset="765933">The American Association of Trial Lawyers have raised that in their brief, but we didn't raise it in our brief for today.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.860" offset="791428">It's not before us?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="martin_lassoff" startTime="175.864" stopTime="459.805">
            <label>Mr. Martin Lassoff</label>
            <text syncTime="175.864" offset="795503">It's not before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.286" offset="813162">The point involved is who was this statute designed to protect?</text>
            <text syncTime="189.619" offset="850465">Going back to the original basis in law, at one point, a longshoreman had to elect before the first payment of compensation whether or not he could sue a third party because if he accepted one payment of compensation, his rights to sue were assigned absolutely to his employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.395" offset="937609">That changed until he was given the right to accept compensation short of an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.285" offset="973136">If he, out of the words, if there was voluntary payment of compensation for a man who was out for six months and the employer voluntary pay that money, that would not give the case to his employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.477" offset="1029978">But if there was a hearing at which permanency was decided, and an order was entered, that order gave the case to the man's employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.348" offset="1073446">In 1957 I believe, this Court decided Blazey Czaplicki case which said that conflict of interest and Blazey Czaplicki was a very strong conflict of interest case.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.313" offset="1137289">The insurance carrier represented both parties to the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.568" offset="1166338">Therefore in 1959, Congress amended this Act and said, “You can keep your case Mr. Longshoreman until such a point as six months after a formal award because we have several interest here.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.398" offset="1237600">All of this is based on a quid pro quo between the longshoreman and the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.924" offset="1263722">Nowhere is the shipping company or the shipping corporations mentioned they do not belong in the statute and they have never been mentioned until 1972 when an additional part of the statute was added called Section 905 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="312.473" offset="1341880">What -- what was the intent?</text>
            <text syncTime="316.574" offset="1358285">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.910" offset="1367689">After -- after the enactment of this Act by Congress -- by judicial law, certain things apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.886" offset="1403529">Prior, there was a Sieracki case, the Court gave longshoreman the right to sue vessels for a violation of the doctrine of seaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.539" offset="1438220">Subsequent, the Ryan case gave the ship companies the right to sue the employer for -- on a contract basis for actual or implied warranties of workmanlike performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.307" offset="1497257">So the issue was sort of dead because any employer of maritime labor obviously had a conflict of interest between the employee and the fact that they would immediately be brought into the action by the shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.745" offset="1555040">Notwithstanding that, there were several cases in that period, the Potomac Electric Power Company case and McClendon against Charente which interpreted the meaning of Section 933 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="381.580" offset="1618360">Both of these cases say and certainly PEPCO in clear language say that any time there is a failure by the employer or the persons subrogated to the employee's rights to sue, then that case should go back to the employee and that it is not up to the employee to prove a conflict of interest with his employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.793" offset="1735180">In 1972 as stated, there was sort of a political arrangement made between the stevedoring companies and the laborer suppliers.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.107" offset="1792440">The political arrangement was that in exchange for a substantial increase in benefits, the longshoreman would have certain judicially created rights taken away from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.409" offset="1857642">They would have the right of a doctrine of seaworthiness taken away from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.272" offset="1881152">The shipowner, in exchange for that benefit, would have taken away from it the judicialliated -- judicially created application of Ryan.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="459.805" stopTime="469.599">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="459.805" offset="1931203">Will this political compromise that you referred that took place in 1972 had the full participation of the longshoreman workers union, did it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="martin_lassoff" startTime="469.599" stopTime="682.177">
            <label>Mr. Martin Lassoff</label>
            <text syncTime="469.599" offset="1970387">It had participation of the long -- of the Maritime Unions, non-sea -- not non-sea unions and of the stevedores.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.084" offset="2008316">The shipping companies had no part in this arrangement at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.777" offset="2019183">It was strictly the longshoreman, the shipper carriers, the stevedoring companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.804" offset="2047291">This was not really a bill that was participated in or abetted by shipping interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.242" offset="2072996">This was strictly stevedoring interest and I'm not sure that the longshore unions were aware of what was happening because in 1972, there was no application of a six-month assignment because quite clearly, Congress, being in this Circuit and PEPCO which is a DC case and the District of Columbia Workers which are covered by this very Act, since the Act is silent about the intent of this section, it must be assumed that Congress believed the law to be as it was in Potomac Electric Power.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.116" offset="2260450">And that is there was no assignment or if there was, it would revest if for any reason the right to bring this action did -- was not undertaken properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.509" offset="2326070">In Czaplicki, the Court talks about a trustee situation which they didn't feel necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.534" offset="2354178">Mr. Justice Frankfurter did think it necessary but it wasn't done.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.522" offset="2370165">We have certain equitable proceedings here.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.648" offset="2386569">The only interest that the shipowner has in this litigation at all is that he'd be sued by the real party in interest, one lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.863" offset="2435471">There has not been more than one lawsuit brought since 1972, since the decisions in Rodriguez, since decisions in the Caldwell against Ogden Steamship Company, since the Bandy cases, no stevedoring company has brought a lawsuit to enforce its statutory lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.464" offset="2541841">We have been successful under the decision in Rodriguez which indicated that ratification was a measure where companies were willing to cooperate to get certain insurance companies, not stevedoring companies, but insurance companies of stevedores to ratify the longshoreman's course of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.854" offset="2635464">The one time we tried the suggestion in Caldwell which was involuntary joinder, that was against the company called International Terminal Operating Company, their attorney's opposed the involuntary joinder and was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.136" offset="2700561">But the fact is that no stevedoring company that I know of anywhere has ever sued a ship to assert the claims of the injured employee and the decision that a longshoreman can prove a conflict of interest which is so apparent on the face, never happened without means of extra protection, it doesn't make sense to me, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="940.722" offset="3854965">It isn't because every lawyer practicing in this field knew of the various statutes of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.520" offset="3886102">As Your Honor pointed out to me, not yourself, nobody knew that this Act could be triggered by an informal agreement of a claims examiner when the statute specifically said that it had to be the deputy commissioner or the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.608" offset="3962485">This is the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.453" offset="3969799">We are making a -- a statute of limitations out of an assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.888" offset="3991533">The assignment wasn't intended to hurt the employee, it was intended according to law to give the cause of action to the employer who had better assets to pursue it.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.763" offset="4043046">I don't believe that but that was what Congress specifically stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.096" offset="4064362">Now, what is the actual fact?</text>
            <text syncTime="996.605" offset="4078468">The actual fact is that employers may not choose to do this, one for fear of antagonizing their customers, bad business or two, their lawyers do not work the way plaintiff's lawyers do on a contingency basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.471" offset="4141894">They would expect to be paid whether they won or lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.686" offset="4158821">And I say to you that the best person to have these rights is the plaintiff's lawyer, the plaintiff, the injured worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.131" offset="4200512">If he has a right, let him have the right that he always had, the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.482" offset="4221933">If an employer refuses to sue and we can give the employer the right to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.715" offset="4238860">We can send him a registered letter, if you don't sue, we're going to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.057" offset="4256205">That protects the employer, does it not?</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.844" offset="4267386">But why should this injured man who gets nothing for pain and suffering, who gets nothing except two thirds of his pay and unless it's permanent, that two thirds does not go up if the union pay scale goes up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.959" offset="4339902">In other words, the best that a longshoreman can get here is two thirds of his pay at the time of the accident regardless of whether the pay scale goes up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.561" offset="4378249">Nothing for pain and suffering and while you will hear argument that the pay scale went up a great deal, in certain instances, it went down a great deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.702" offset="4418791">I will save that for rebuttal if I may.</text>

            <text syncTime="1091.975" offset="4459960">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.666" offset="4462677">My name is Stearns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.382" offset="4469574">I represent the first two respondents being Compass Shipping Company, Djakarta Lloyd and Arya National Shipping Line in this case which involves the question of Section 33 and also Section 5 (b) of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.443" offset="4541776">There's been a brief reference to some part of the history of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.866" offset="4563510">As I understand it, the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act was adopted in 1927 in response to a decision of this Court making the Longshore and Jones Act seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.141" offset="4616591">At that time, there was a Section 33.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.516" offset="4630070">It provided that longshoreman have an election that we have a compensation or a suit for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.008" offset="4660058">In response apparently to the concern for the possibility that someone would unwittingly lose his right to a third -- third party damage suit, Congress in 1938 amended Section 33 to expand the rights in a way which this Court in 1947 in the American Stevedore against Porello case held to extend a longshoreman the dual right to accept voluntary compensation and thereafter a sue for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.858" offset="4803418">After Ryan and perhaps before that, perhaps in the contribution cases, the existence of the right to accept a -- a voluntary compensation and sue for damages created a conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.524" offset="4862142">Unquestionably, there was a conflict of interest which was raised by the Ryan indemnity right which in instances where there was common insurance between a defendant and a third party defendant as in the Czaplicki case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.372" offset="4921492">It was held by this Court that it was inappropriate to give effect to the Section 33 (b) assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.998" offset="4952003">In response to that, Congress in 1959, in attempt to overcome the conflict of interest, gave longshoreman an additional six months to sue following receipt of compensation pursuant to an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.463" offset="5017831">As a result of this Court's efforts on behalf of longshoreman, that in part demonstrated by the Porello case, the extension of the dual remedy of compensation and a right to sue for damages as a result of this Court's Ryan decision, as a result of this Court's Sieracki decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.645" offset="5106648">The situation existed -- a situation existed whereby longshoremen were of course, by statute guaranteed -- guaranteed compensation and in effect have guarantee -- guaranteed -- excuse me -- a -- virtually a certain right to recover damages as -- as a result of these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.763" offset="5199121">And as a result directly of this Court's efforts on behalf of the longshoreman, there followed an explosion of litigation in the years according to the congressional documents between 1961 and 1972 to the point where in courts such as New York, virtually every longshoreman's reported accident resulted in a third party suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.961" offset="5299849">By virtue of Sieracki, it was virtually necessary only for the longshoreman to show that he was hurt aboard the ship as a result of a contest between the shipowner and the stevedore as to who should pay the damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.369" offset="5361498">The ultimate recovery of the plaintiff was further guaranteed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.118" offset="5384486">Congress in 1972 was there -- therefore consul -- confronted with a situation where this Court's efforts had resulted in a situation where a longshoreman had a free access to suit and a free access to recovery in the third party cases where as a result of those facts, there had been a tremendous increase in litigation and took steps by enacting the 1972 amendments in order to reduce the volume of litigation in exchange for vastly increased compensation benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.410" offset="5541639">As Mr. Lassoff has indicated, Congress in 1972 took away from longshoreman certain things and this represents the first instance since 1927 where either by this Court or any other Court or by Congress, something was taken away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.473" offset="5617916">What was taken away was two things, we submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.612" offset="5630455">The first one obviously being the right to recover for seaworthiness and the second thing we believe is that there was an additional restriction placed on the third party right in order to serve the first purpose of the 1972 amendments which was to reduce litigation and relieve shipowners and the courts from the enormous burden of case after case after case of personal injuries involving a longshoreman, some of which were of the kind or the type or the apparent lack of seriousness of the cases involved in this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.962" offset="5775905">The additional step taken by Congress, we submit, was to make the right of the longshoreman to sue depend upon that suit being in accordance with Section 33 which we read as indicating that suit can be maintained only if authorized by the six months provision in Section 33 (b) which means, we submit, that no suit brought by a longshoreman after six months can be maintained since the six months provision is a constituent element of his course of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.283" offset="5969107">In the congressional documents, there is an indication in the Port of Philadelphia that the compensation insurance rate for these accidents, including the cost of compensation and the stevedore's third party, Ryan indemnity liability was approximately $40 a payroll hundred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.085" offset="6060326">According to the New York State Rating Board, in New York today, for Workmen's Compensation alone, in the category stevedoring, not otherwise classified, the manual rate for stevedores is $87 and change the payroll hundred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.585" offset="6154367">That is to say that the cost of the stevedores both for compensation and third party Ryan indemnity liability in 1972 was approximately half of what it is today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.498" offset="6210060">And these figures are not figures that are the product of inflation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.708" offset="6226883">It's $40 per hundred and $87 per hundred and it represents a doubling of costs in real terms as a direct result of the vast increase in benefits achieved by the 1972 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.348" offset="6285397">It means in effect that the maritime industry and since the stevedore has one customer, the shipowner, since the stevedore is in effect an agency of the shipowner but the shipowner pays this costs directly, usually as soon as the ship sails.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.005" offset="6368049">It means the cost of these claims before the first complaint is filed has doubled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.413" offset="6409636">It also means that if there is not relief from litigation, that the purposes of the Act to achieve a reduction of litigation will not be achieved and that in effect, there will be no so-called quid pro quo extended to the maritime industry in exchange for a benefit structure which is of unprecedented generosity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.012" offset="6512036">It is vital to the interest of the maritime community that there'd be in one appropriate form or other curb on litigation involving cases like these, involving contused aversions, aberrations and fractured bones, resulting in six and seven weeks of alleged period of disability where compensation benefits of three, four, five, six and seven thousand are routinely paid based on the earnings and benefit structure existing in 1973 which have been vastly increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.549" offset="6670233">It is essential to the vitality of the maritime industry that cases of this kind -- I mean, the cases of this kind where -- where and whenever appropriate to be handled as compensation matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.747" offset="6726971">As a result of this Court's recent decision in Bloomer, a longshoreman who receives for example $5,000 in Workmen's Compensation, benefits as a result of his third party suit only when his verdict exceeds $7500.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.086" offset="6792382">As a result of this Court's recent decision in the Norfolk and Western against the Liepelt case, the compensation liability or rather the tax liability of an injured employee must be reduced in calculating his lost wages and lost future wages as a typical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.044" offset="6872212">In longshoreman's personal injury cases, the total course of action that is presented in the guise of a longshoreman suit against the stevedore is the claim of the stevedore to recover its so-called lien.</text>

            <text syncTime="1761.666" offset="7138661">The case involved a man in his 50s who had sustained a knee injury and as a result of the knee injury, he had surgery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.753" offset="7171053">He had a heart condition and he was found to be by a District Court judge permanently disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.436" offset="7201773">There was a dispute about a reduction in the award to him after the bench trial on the basis of whether or not he was just industrially disabled or whether in fact he was totally disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.506" offset="7254018">In any event, there was a calculation of damages with this reduction which the Court of Appeals found to be inappropriate of damages in range of $110,000 and the case after a clear clash between Judge Friendly and Judge Meskill with respect to when and what circumstances a -- a shipowner should be liable to a longshoreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.359" offset="7341476">The case was remanded for a retrial on damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.234" offset="7360911">The case was settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.940" offset="7367807">It was settled a little bit less than seven years after the injury at which point the lien was $63,900.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.285" offset="7409185">It was settled for $90,000 so-called fresh money in addition to the lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.566" offset="7430292">The stevedore waived its lien and $90,000 was advanced by the shipowner to be disposed of and settle the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2147.146" offset="8680617">Twenty five years ago, I was admitted to the bar of this Court to work on the brief in the Czaplicki case and I find it rather fascinating that I have returned here now 25 years later to talk to the Court about the interpretation of Czaplicki which makes me I think the historian on this particular argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.730" offset="8774971">And if we could return for the moment to 1956 when the Congress decided to respond to the Ryan decision and they did so very expeditiously following the decision of this Court in early 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.883" offset="8855533">There were extensive hearings held, the conflict of interest argument was explored fully.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.217" offset="8884894">The Czaplicki case was discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.508" offset="8898060">And at that time while the hearings were going on, it was between the argument and the decision in the Czaplicki case and the attorneys for Mr. Czaplicki testified in 1956 and they testified rather optimistically about the --</text>

            <text syncTime="2223.085" offset="8984369">That's correct, in 1956, in May and June.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.384" offset="8997534">And in June, this Court decided Czaplicki and as I said they were optimistic about the result and it was warranted from their point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.979" offset="9039957">The Court or the Congress then responded and began drafting this six-month provision rule from the time of the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.294" offset="9097218">Now, we've talked about six months here but frequently as in these cases before us, the time runs anywhere from a year and a half to two years that the man himself has the right to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.792" offset="9147164">He has the full opportunity to bring suit anytime during that period and that's the thrust of the Rodriguez case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.222" offset="9180914">Now in those hearings, there was a comment by I think the representative of the Association of the Bar, the City of New York, who said that these congressional adjustments were the complete answer to Mr. Justice Black's objections in his dissent in the Ryan case that the stevedore when in effect the suing itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.775" offset="9267118">So this was all hashed over way back when in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.571" offset="9290315">And then we move forward, Mr. Stearns has covered the 1972 amendments, but we move forward to a number of the cases that this Court has had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.233" offset="9332947">And in two recent decisions of this Court, Edmonds and Bloomer, the Court itself has read this particular Section 933 (b) in accordance with its plain meaning, that is that the course of action is assigned after six months to the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.302" offset="9417270">And in the 1972 amendments when they added Section 905, the Court incorporated Section 933 into that section and said he may sue in accordance with the provisions of 933 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.356" offset="9485502">Then we ran into a consistent line of cases in recent years by this Court where if a court follows the plain language of the Act, I cite the Caputo case, I cite the Rasmussen case where they discussed the plain language and legislative history, the examination of the congressional record, the reports of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.434" offset="9609740">The Edmonds case also discusses that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.555" offset="9622279">We go on to the Pfeiffer case against Ford where the point of rest question was considered and the Court said it was inconsistent congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.917" offset="9679644">So all throughout these cases right down to the Bloomer case and the most recent case on December 15, the Potomac Electric case where again, the Court defers to Congress to the plain language of the Act, to the unambiguous provisions, even where they -- they may reach an anomalous result and I think that case involved a question of whether schedule awards applied or the man could take his -- his wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.633" offset="9810569">And the Court said, “We might have done otherwise perhaps, but Congress has said this and this is the way we have to rule.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2454.179" offset="9908790">I return again to the Czaplicki case and there, the Court in discussing the conflict said, “Under the peculiar circumstances, the peculiar facts of this case, we find the conflict.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.352" offset="9969394">Now as opposed to that, we have the Caldwell case which I think misinterprets Czaplicki, and says on page 1046, "The fundamental point in Czaplicki is that notwithstanding a statutory assignment of the longshoreman's right of action, the right of action maybe revested in the longshoreman when it becomes manifest that the assignee with knowledge of its exclusive right to control and prosecute the claim nevertheless declines to do so for any reason not because of a conflict but for any reason."</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.033" offset="10120173">And then it goes on to legislate certain procedures that are followed, again taking over the congressional role here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.649" offset="10150579">Now I think Congress has spoken and the man has his season in which to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.997" offset="10175970">Thereafter, Congress really intended I think that the course of action will then be assigned and if the assignee didn't do anything about it, that's the end of the case, two intentions not to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.996" offset="10228006">One man -- manifested by the man himself and one by the employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2549.406" offset="10289655">May I point out to the Court that in Edmonds which is a decision of this Court in March of 1979, the Court cautioned that this change in the statute was striking a delicate balance between the lore as it was, as created by the judiciary and Congress, and as amended by Congress taking away certain rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.081" offset="10412326">Nowhere in the 1972 bill does it mention the six months statute as being intended to take anything away from the rights of the longshoreman and Mr. Justice White who wrote the opinion said very clearly that where Congress has been silent in this delicate balance, it is not up to us to act.</text>
