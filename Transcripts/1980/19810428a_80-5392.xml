            <text syncTime="1690.725" offset="6911298">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.764" offset="6987367">The primary issue presented by this case is whether a state prisoner is ineligible for transfer to federal custody under 18 U.S.C. 5003 unless he has a need for specialized treatment that is available in the federal prison system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.416" offset="7050061">It is the position of the United States and the State of Vermont that Section 5003 is not so limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.224" offset="7077228">Rather, in our view, the statutory requirements are met and any state prisoner regardless of treatment needs may be transferred from state to federal custody once a contract has been entered into between the state and federal governments, and once the Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons has certified that facilities in federal institutions are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.701" offset="7159148">On behalf of the United States I shall explain how the language of the statute, its legislative history, and its consistent administrative application require that construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.915" offset="7203974">The Attorney General of the State of Vermont will discuss the state's vital interest in having this statute construed in the manner we urge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.973" offset="7236261">Preliminarily, in response to Justice Marshall's question, we would say that our certification saying that facilities in federal institutions are available would imply that treatment facilities are also available, because what we have in the federal system are in fact treatment facilities; they are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.669" offset="7319017">Also, with respect to the question regarding transfer under the Interstate Correctional Compact, not only could he be transferred to New Hampshire, in which case he could be visited more easily, he could also be transferred presumably to Colorado, in which case it would be even more difficult for his family to visit him, yet he would assert no challenge to that type of transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.611" offset="7418805">There is no suggestion in the statutory language that the federal prison system's authority to assume custody of a state prisoner is conditioned on the prisoner's need for specialized treatment available in the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.809" offset="7471572">The plain language of Section 5003(a), as the Court recognizes, authorizes the Attorney General to contract not only for the purpose of treatment but equally for the purpose of custody, care, subsistence, education, and training of state prisoners.</text>

            <label>Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="1847.069" offset="7536669">But why then does the statute require that the Director shall certify that proper and adequate treatment facilities and personnel be available?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="barbara_e_etkind" startTime="1857.204" stopTime="1944.482">
            <label>Ms. Barbara E. Etkind</label>
            <text syncTime="1857.204" offset="7577212">Well, there are a couple of answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.173" offset="7585048">One is that the description of treatment facilities is merely, the use of "treatment facilities" is merely a correct description of the federal facilities, the federal prisons, because what we have are treatment facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.840" offset="7643667">To be sure, other federal statutes refer to prisons as penal and correctional institutions, but those provisions were passed, not only were passed by Congresses other than that which passed 5003, but they concern the operation and management of federal prisons as institutional entities rather than the slots within them that may be available for the housing of state prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.204" offset="7737185">And finally, even if the phrase, 5003 still requires no more than a certification that facilities are available, presumably in the case that the prisoner would need them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.620" offset="7810851">But nothing in the statutory language suggests that the Director must make an individualized determination in the case of each potential state transferee that he needs specialized treatment available in the federal system and that specific treatment facilities have been earmarked for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.082" offset="7872709">Our argument is not merely as petitioner misconceives it, that Section 5003(a) contains no implied right of action in favor of state prisoners, but rather--</text>

            <text syncTime="2298.823" offset="9343612">The requests that the Bureau of Prisons had been getting was for space in the federal system for juveniles and for drug addicts, and we had that space available and so we determined to make that available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.896" offset="9395961">But in a gross sense the intent of Congress was not to limit it in that way, it was just to make what we had available to the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="2353.364" offset="9561786">The Bureau's construction of Section 5003 has permitted it to accept custody of nearly 172 New Mexico prisoners who were displaced by the massive disruption in that state's penitentiary on February 2 and 3, 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.670" offset="9626988">Similarly, pursuant to its broad construction of Section 5003, the Bureau assumed custody of 111 Idaho state prisoners after riots occurred in that state's maximum security facility on July 23, 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.226" offset="9685293">And more recently, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland ordered the Maryland prison system to transfer 100 of its inmates to the federal system in order to partially relieve the state system's overcrowding problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.782" offset="9747465">None of those emergency relocations would be possible under petitioner's cramped construction of the statute, nor would the federal system be authorized to afford protective custody to a state prisoner who was in danger from his fellow state inmates or to accept custody of any state prisoner regardless of how much he could benefit from or indeed desires certain aspects of federal incarceration, unless such a prisoner was otherwise in need of specialized treatment available in the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.176" offset="9865016">As the court below put it, adopting petitioner's view of the statute would mean that a wholly incorrigible prisoner or on the other hand a fully rehabilitated prisoner incarcerated not for treatment but solely for purposes of deterrence could not be transferred from state to federal custody solely to take advantage of training and educational opportunities available only at federal facilities.</text>
