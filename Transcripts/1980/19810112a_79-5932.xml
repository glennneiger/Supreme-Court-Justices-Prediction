            <text syncTime="231.849" offset="1075577">The second standard is whether the State could proceed to break up this family in a judicial proceeding using a mere preponderance of the evidence standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.753" offset="1103162">The third standard is whether the State could break up this family without demonstrating that any of the conduct alleged against these parents had caused any actual, substantial harm to the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.645" offset="1146734">Briefly stated, the facts of the case were these.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.680" offset="1162930">John Doe and Jane Roe were half brother and sister, and beginning in the 1970s they lived together and had five children.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.036" offset="1196367">The Delaware State Welfare Agency, the Division of Social Services, knew about Mr. and Mrs. Doe's relationship since 1972, and had previously indicated to them that that relationship would not be a factor that the Division would consider about them raising their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.462" offset="1261987">However, in early 1975 workers from the Division went to the local Attorney General, the attorney that advised them.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.168" offset="1296886">He told them at that meeting that so long as there were children in the Doe home, they would not be able to prove the Does were unfit parents and would not be able to get a termination of parental rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.559" offset="1342444">At that meeting, then, it was decided that in order to remove the children from the home the parents would be charged with the criminal charge of incest.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.165" offset="1380792">Once they were charged with that, the Division would then proceed to obtain custody of the children and then file a termination of parental rights as to all of their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.389" offset="1421752">That plan of action by the Division was followed through.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.324" offset="1433454">Within a week after the meeting the Attorney General brought a criminal charge of incest against the parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.395" offset="1461771">The parents were incarcerated in default of a $1,000 bond for 19 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.132" offset="1480684">Given their absence, the Division of Social Service was in effect given temporary custody of the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.369" offset="1505657">Subsequently, the parents were convicted of the criminal charge of incest, a misdemeanor in Delaware, and permanent custody of the children was given to the Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.527" offset="1550274">What's important to note about the incest conviction is that, as the parents testified, after the conviction of the misdemeanor they were told by the presiding judge that presided at that trial that if they underwent sterilization that would be a substantial factor in them regaining their children.</text>

            <text syncTime="401.859" offset="1755597">The statute under which they based that provision was a former Delaware provision which allowed the termination if the parents were not fitted to continue to exercise parental rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1608.793" offset="6583339">I'll just briefly point out that the third issue presented to this Court is the proper standards of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.049" offset="6624403">Recently in Addington v. Texas this Court has outlined those factors where the Constitution compels states to require in its judicial proceeding something beyond a mere preponderance of evidence, and to apply the Addington criteria of loss of liberty, stigmatization, and the possibility of decisions based on unauthorized conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.997" offset="6708204">Those factors clearly are present in a TPR.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.033" offset="6724295">There is an additional criterion, as I pointed out, in a TPR that wasn't present in Addington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.020" offset="6744253">In Addington an original commitment could in effect be changed, an erroneous original commitment could be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.107" offset="6768599">In a TPR an original erroneous termination is forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.459" offset="6786049">It cannot be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.161" offset="6792841">And despite the State's protest I don't think a higher standard of proof as we asked for causes any problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.398" offset="6817814">As we point out in the brief, numerous states have adopted the clear and convincing evidence, and when Congress has spoken on the issue it has required a showing of harm, and has required a showing of harm beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.539" offset="6866297">It did so analogizing that TPR was in effect a greater punishment than a criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.693" offset="6890957">In sum, unless the lower courts are reversed, the State of Delaware will have taken these children from their parents under an ill defined standard by proving its case by a mere preponderance of evidence, and without any demonstration that any of the children had been harmed by the parents' conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.921" offset="6971832">In so doing, because of the sterilization, the State will have taken the only children these parents will ever have.</text>

            <text syncTime="1724.068" offset="7044452">This case involves abstruse academic and abstract principles of constitutional law but as the Justice' questions have demonstrated, cases that come to this Court are neither abstruse, abstract, or academic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.161" offset="7108818">This case involves five children and their biologic parents, and the right of those parents now separated, and the mother remarried and raising the child of her present husband, to regain parental rights... if this order is final except in the sense that it's not finally final because it's before the Court... to regain the right to some form of contact with these children and perhaps some custody at some future time after planning, according to counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1835.788" offset="7491355">The social worker who participated in the visitations testified at one point that the young child, a baby at that time, Charles, was brought in, cried.</text>

            <text syncTime="2453.202" offset="9960971">Delaware's termination of parental rights statute, the TPR statute, is not, as counsel suggests, unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.427" offset="10009872">We know of no state which doesn't have a similar statutory provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.532" offset="10042264">In fact, in appellants' brief at page 32, notes 52 and 53, in making their standard of proof argument, the appellants list a number of states that use the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof in termination of parental rights standards, parental rights acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.461" offset="10134006">So I would assume that they will concede that there are other TPR statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.015" offset="10156263">In fact, Delaware was in the forefront of having statutes which require both the best interest and the fitness of the parents to be considered with the Cline case in 1967, the very standards which this Court has alluded to in both Offer and in Kilwarren.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.702" offset="10267022">Counsel in his brief recitation of the facts seems to pass over the years intervening between the first contact between Doe and Roe and the Division of Social Services, and the time at which the termination of parental rights action was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.632" offset="10358659">In those three years there was continued contact between the agency and the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.006" offset="10400246">The children were first placed voluntarily, because Mr. Doe came to the agency and said that he was not able at that time to provide support for his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.599" offset="10458552">After helping him obtain employment and helping the family find a nice home, the younger of the two children at that time, Bill, was replaced in the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.625" offset="10522708">The Division observed the family life, was satisfied that at that point in 1973 the family was coping, providing stability for the one child replaced, the elder child, Amy, shortly thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.740" offset="10615182">The reaction to that was that Mr. Doe quit his job very promptly; he went out and found another, was fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.996" offset="10652171">The family moved in the middle of the night, the night before a worker was to make a regular visit, leaving no forwarding address.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.571" offset="10702431">From that time on the relationships between the Division and the family continued to increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.779" offset="10743286">The Division's policy is to maintain the family unit whenever possible, and when it becomes impossible by reason of incapability or failure of the parents to be able to provide the nurturing stable environment that the child has a right to, and family integrity, then the Division believes that a permanent placement alternative as close to the family situation that is a new adoptive family is the preferable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.071" offset="10892498">And in fact the record discloses that it was not until the Division made the determination that these children should be put in adoptive care where they could be received into a new family, albeit not a biologic one, but a new family, that the TPR was filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3179.791" offset="12867355">The standard and the rationale for a vagueness standard is that the State in enacting legislation which affects individuals should put the reasonable man on notice as to what conduct is prohibited so that he may act accordingly and so that in applying such standards the courts may determine without a discriminatory or standardless application whether the statute is in force.</text>

            <text syncTime="3250.388" offset="13149686">The statute says that parental rights may be terminated when one is considered not fitted to exercise parental duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.247" offset="13217187">That seems to me to be... and to the Delaware courts... to be a standard that is comprehensible by the ordinary person: care, feeding, clothing, providing for the emotional needs, and the need to stay in out of the rain, Plaintiffs submit that there are no slide rule calculations for determining what's a statute which would survive the void for vagueness attack, and as the amici agree, there should be in the case of child custody some flexibility for determining the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.901" offset="13431809">As I say, I think the Delaware Supreme Court in referring to the dictionary definition has suggested that the statute is on its face sufficient to give standards.</text>
