            <text syncTime="59.585" offset="380870">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="62.912" offset="394244">We are here today on a writ of certiorari to the Texas Court of Civil Appeals, 14th Judicial District, on a matter raising two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.001" offset="446594">First, there's an issue of subject matter jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Texas to consider and try and hear cases arising under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.262" offset="503645">The second issue is an issue involving the applicability of this Court's ruling in the case of Liepelt which finds that juries are knowledgeable taxpayers of this country... I'm paraphrasing... and that therefore the trial court has the duty of performing and providing instructions to the jury as to the effect of federal income taxation on jury damage awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.108" offset="619002">I'd like to first turn briefly to what I feel is the threshold question, and that is the question of subject matter jurisdiction to allow the courts of many states to take jurisdiction for matters arising on the Outer Continental Shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.210" offset="707400">In 1953 the Outer Continental Shelf was becoming a very vital area.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.500" offset="756615">The Congress of this country felt at that time that there must be a necessity for jurisdiction over this developing area.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.933" offset="810323">This is not a situation of the Congress going into a state and buying land or taking land away from an already existing state.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.147" offset="863195">This had already been laid to rest in this Court's opinion in United States v. California.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.081" offset="886914">California had claimed ownership of the tidelands.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.547" offset="912723">The state found that the United States had paramount jurisdiction over the tidelands.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.701" offset="941353">Because of the historic nature of the state's claim to rights in the tideland areas, Congress passed, also in 1953, the Submerged Lands Act which ceded to the states that area lying offshore of their land areas that had historically been claimed by the states.</text>

            <label>Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="226.486" offset="1048560">Do you think the '53 Act was primarily thought of in terms of personal injury jurisdiction?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_d_kennedy" startTime="233.391" stopTime="451.506">
            <label>Mr. Charles D. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="233.391" offset="1076145">No, Your Honor, I think it was thought of to encompass the entire activities on the Outer Continental Shelf beyond the Submerged Land Act's ceding of rights to territorial waters of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.276" offset="1131733">The personal injury aspect of this case comes up incidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.677" offset="1173320">This is really a case involving a contractual dispute between the Pool Corporation, who is a drilling contractor, and Mobil Oil Company, who was the leasor of the area that was being drilled.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.593" offset="1228909">The plaintiff in the case below was an employee of Pool Corporation, an employee of my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.388" offset="1264122">On the basis of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Mr. Gaedecke, the plaintiff's sole remedy against Pool Corporation was under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act which is definitely adopted as the exclusive remedy of employees on the Outer Continental Shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.378" offset="1348132">The Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act also recognizes the right of third party suits by such employees under Section 905(b) if it happens to be due to the negligence of a vessel, under Section 33 if it is due to any other type of third party action.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.636" offset="1421170">So this all, the plaintiff's primary claim had to arise under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, and under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act was thereby extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.788" offset="1469758">We move then to an area where because of international implication the Government had severe reservations of attempting to take sovereignty beyond the states' historical territorial limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.467" offset="1548439">They adopted the procedure set out in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act which was a horizontal extension of jurisdiction of the Federal Government to cover the subsoils, seabeds, and any artificial islands constructed thereon.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.333" offset="1631926">The Act specifically did not attempt to take on any jurisdiction over the high seas, leaving that to the maritime and admiralty courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.313" offset="1687828">The Act itself, after first providing for this extension of jurisdiction, then turned its attention to what laws would be applicable in this Outer Continental Shelf area, in this new area of jurisdiction for the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.679" offset="1773301">They first said that federal law and regulations are applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.142" offset="1831188">They delegated to the Secretary of Interior the right to promulgate rules and regulations which were made applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.545" offset="1864729">Then, in order to plug any potential gaps or voids in the federal law as it existed at that time, they said that we are going to adopt as federal law the law of the adjacent state.</text>

I'm paraphrasing this... that if there is a void, if Congress has not acted, or if there has been no rule or regulation promulgated by the Secretary of Interior, then, to fill these voids, we will adopt, or we will have as surrogate for federal law... surrogate federal law... the law of the adjacent state.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.852" offset="2077993">But, in the Act itself... and I think the Act itself clearly shows that there is exclusive jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="512.716" offset="2193454">It does not say original and exclusive, and certainly in FELA cases and in 1983 cases the federal courts are the primary fora but nonetheless state courts can entertain 1983 actions and it's my understanding that state courts can entertain FELA actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="551.199" offset="2347368">But even if you get beyond that, then you're left with the legislative intent which I'll go into in a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.398" offset="2372132">The caveat that was put in the Act in Subsection (a)(2), after they say,</text>

            <text syncTime="773.140" offset="3235113">Prior to 1953 there was no Outer Continental Shelf as we know it now; it was all high seas.</text>

            <text syncTime="926.202" offset="3847423">I think, in a situation such as this, since we have no concurrent jurisdiction to begin with or no state jurisdiction over this area to begin with, there was a taking enacted by Congress, ceding it back as they did in the Submerged Lands Act, saying, okay, Mr. Louisiana, Mr. Texas, we give you the right over this area.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles D. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="957.879" offset="3974065">But there is nothing in the Act to indicate that this was an intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.639" offset="4001128">In fact, the minority people definitely recognized that this was not the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.029" offset="4022653">Congress wanted the adjacent states to have nothing to do with control of this area on the Outer Continental Shelf because with all the international implications that were then involved, Congress was obviously worried at that time that there was going to be a hue and outcry from our world friends that we were trying to take over the sovereignty of this seabed area.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.693" offset="4105304">That's why they were so careful in placing this, I feel, in the hands of the Federal Government to rule and regulate without interference from the many states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.705" offset="4149399">We're talking about not just one or two states that might have an interest in... The Outer Continental Shelf extends, of course, completely around the continental United States, varying in size from 250 miles off the New England coast to 50 to 150 miles in the Gulf of Mexico, to as little as five to 40 miles off California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.398" offset="4236125">Then, when you get to Alaska, the Outer Continental Shelf is bigger than the State of Alaska itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.208" offset="4251381">So this is the area that we are talking about that Congress was so deeply involved in and interested in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.941" offset="4274369">The Act's history and the minority report, if the Court will recall, Mr. Justice White has had an opportunity to review the legislative history of this Act at some length in the Rodrigue opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.035" offset="4430685">I think from a reading of that opinion it shows a clear indication of the vesting of exclusive jurisdiction in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.578" offset="4480945">As noted by Mr. Justice White, it states that</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.886" offset="4506127">"on the other hand, federal enforcement of the law in this area was insisted upon by the Department of Justice and there was substantial doubt whether state law and jurisdiction could or should be extended to these structures. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.317" offset="4567880">"A federal solution was thought necessary. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.505" offset="4576553">The legislative history... one thing, I think, should be pointed, was, this Act was fought and fought bitterly by the Senators from Louisiana, the Senators from Texas, but primarily led by the Senators from Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.179" offset="4687312">Senator Ellender, the senior Senator from Louisiana, offered an amendment where, and described in his own words,</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.768" offset="4745617">"my amendment is very simple. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.751" offset="4757634">"It would clarify a multiplicity of problems which are bound to arise. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.827" offset="4781875">"It would give coastal states the right to extend their jurisdictions to these lands. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.668" offset="4805281">"For what purposes? "</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.731" offset="4813536">"Merely for the purpose of administering the criminal and civil laws which may appertain to that area. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.789" offset="4841748">And this amendment was defeated by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.427" offset="4864318">Again, we urge it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.676" offset="4881245">Senator Long from Louisiana filed a subsequent amendment trying to get Congress to adopt it, accepting for the most part all of Senator Ellender's original amendment, but deleting any possibility of confusion that the amendment may in some way provide for the taxing powers of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.573" offset="4976853">We thought maybe that was what the Congress was looking at, just simply that they were afraid this was going to give the states taxing powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.602" offset="4997020">So, he specifically deletes that, Senator Long does, and that amendment was defeated after floor argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.583" offset="5020948">Senator Long then submitted another amendment; it was a compromise amendment with the majority leaders, and simply added the word "adjacent state" to what law was to be adopted as federal law, because the original Act said, just the nearest point of land, the law would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.997" offset="5118542">So they put in this adjacent state rule instead of the nearest point of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.494" offset="5136514">And that is what was finally enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.836" offset="5149889">Senator Long filed the minority report and recognized in his minority report that there was no state court jurisdiction as far as this Act was concerned, and that was his brief or his minority report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.689" offset="5213314">He was still unhappy and dissatisfied with the congressional action, so I think there was clear legislative intent as to what Congress was proposing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.137" offset="5259080">Now, this case in 25 years up to 1978, this legislation, had already been piecemealed and added to, in a piecemeal sort of way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.552" offset="5332746">In 1978 there was a codification of various laws and rules and various regulations into what's been referred to as the 1978 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.110" offset="5386976">I would simply like to point out that as far as I'm concerned the 1978 amendments did not in any way change the jurisdictional approach.</text>

            <text syncTime="1430.608" offset="5865017">And they simply go back and reiterate the standards of law that's applied under the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1864.826" offset="7601846">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.885" offset="7622117">The objective of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is clearly stated in the Presidential Proclamation 1945, in the Congressional Record, and in the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.565" offset="7688886">It says specifically that what we are dealing with is the resources in the shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.110" offset="7715009">And that is what the states and the Federal Government were fighting over, the resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.326" offset="7735906">They gave no deliberate attention to what court would have jurisdiction over these disputes arising out of the Act on the shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.713" offset="7777389">No one has taken the position on the respondents' side of the aisle that we are asking that the courts of the states have sole jurisdiction of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.753" offset="7841546">The Administration complained about those provisions in the Act originally which would provide, apparently, for sole jurisdiction in state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.217" offset="7887417">And they insisted that the Act be amended so as to provide that you would treat those fixed structures and fixed platforms as if they were an area of federal... a federal enclave; that's what they were to be treated as, as an area of federal jurisdiction located within a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.710" offset="7965471">We say that that falls directly in line with this Court's opinion expressed by Justice Marshall in the Evans case out of the State of Maryland, when we had a federal enclave in which the voters complained that they were being deprived by the Commissioners of Maryland of their voting rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.860" offset="8046032">And the Court's clear statement in there was that despite the fact that they were residents of a federal enclave within the state, that the state courts had jurisdiction and the state courts had process over those certain residents of that federal enclave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.570" offset="8116876">The Act says specifically that you will treat those platforms as federal enclaves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.475" offset="8140491">Now, the Claflin v. Houseman decision which came one year after the federal lower court system was established, 1876, actually addresses the very contentions which are being made by Gulf Offshore in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.981" offset="8218545">They say that jurisdiction, exclusive jurisdiction, in a sovereign follows the sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.541" offset="8252713">And that a state court is not entitled to have concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.335" offset="8275910">And that was put to rest in Houseman, specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.552" offset="8288762">Justice Story in the Martin v. Hunter case had agreed with that proposition and was disagreed with by this Court in the opinion by Justice Bradley and in it he said, that that general principle, that where the state courts had historic concurrent jurisdiction, you are not going to take that away from them unless you do what Mr. Hamilton said you must do in No. 82 of the Federalist Papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.023" offset="8414672">He said you can only do that in three ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.242" offset="8423554">You can do it by express language in the statute; you can, secondly, do it, if it's not express language, you can give it by express language a jurisdiction of the federal court and deny the state courts jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.236" offset="8479560">That's the second way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.751" offset="8489591">If you can't do it in those two ways, then you must show that the exercise of concurrent jurisdiction in the state courts is simply incompatible by the nature of the case itself with concurrent jurisdiction in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.229" offset="8547479">Now, from a practical standpoint, we cannot fathom why concurrent jurisdiction over Outer Continental Shelf lands cases should not be handled by a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.912" offset="8602231">The objective of the Act is not being offended in any way by state court jurisdiction, there is very little difference in the discovery rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.469" offset="8652491">There is no federal specialty which has been built up over the years in Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act cases which give the federal courts some particular specialized knowledge or expertise over this type of case in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.946" offset="8726365">It's interesting to note that in Gulf Offshore's brief they cite in support of one of their positions a case called, In Re Dearborn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.629" offset="8765131">That case arose off the Texas coast on a fixed platform.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.393" offset="8788119">Five or six men were killed because of an explosion and fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.814" offset="8801807">One of Those men was a man by the name of Monk, whose survivors filed an action in the state district court in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.498" offset="8836602">That case was removed to the federal district court and it was joined in with all of the other survivors' actions arising out of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.024" offset="8870666">That case went to conclusion, went through the 5th Circuit, cert was denied by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.131" offset="8891146">Are we now to take the position that that case, that all of the judgments entered in that case, are void because that derivative jurisdiction which the federal court had to depend on in order to hold that Monk case in his court... and I think it's clear that it is derivative--</text>

            <text syncTime="2223.164" offset="9035237">--I agree with that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.538" offset="9040775">The point I'm really trying to make is that under the Lambert Run Coal Company line of cases, it's clear that a federal court cannot take jurisdiction in a removed action unless the state court had original jurisdiction of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.861" offset="9102006">Now, if that's the case... and I think that it is... Judge Rubin, whom they rely on, is the only federal lower court who has held that the state courts don't have concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.435" offset="9160311">He should have dismissed the Fluor case because the state court, he said, didn't have jurisdiction originally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.743" offset="9193539">He should have simply dismissed it, and he did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.788" offset="9209735">It's just inconsistent that he could rely on the contention that the federal court had exclusive jurisdiction and then say that the state court, he had derivative jurisdiction out of that same state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.470" offset="9260413">Now, in order to take care of the objective of developing the riches, the resources on the Outer Continental Shelf, Congress simply passed two acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.652" offset="9317151">It passed the Submerged Lands Act, which was called the quitclaim legislation which gave the gulf states a three marine leagues area off their low mean tide shore, and it gave the ocean states a three statute mile area off their coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.239" offset="9383502">Then it came along in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act case and said, now we're going to take care of two things: we are going to provide for development of those riches, and we are going to provide for what you are going with the revenue that you obtain from those riches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.560" offset="9452778">That's all they said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.576" offset="9456853">I think, when we get back to the Claflin v. Houseman rule, which says that unless you can meet one of the tests which were established by Mr. Hamilton, that I've already mentioned, then you cannot take away from the state courts their historic concurrent jurisdiction of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.847" offset="9558000">Now, I don't dispute that the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act created a new statutory remedy, and we started from scratch with a federal law which we have to apply as surrogate federal law, but it is not a new remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.621" offset="9637098">And strangely enough, in the Houseman case, again, Mr. Bradley anticipated that, Justice Bradley, and he said specifically, that it was mentioned by Justice Story.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.943" offset="9694359">He said it was indeed intimated by Mr. Justice Story over a dictum in Martin v. Hunter that the state courts could not take cognizance of cases arising under the Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States, as no such jurisdiction existed before the Constitution was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.310" offset="9779831">"This is true as to jurisdiction depending on United States authority, but the same jurisdiction existed, at least to a certain extent, under the authority of the states. "</text>

            <text syncTime="3479.252" offset="14059629">Are they to go in and then sit back in the jury room and say, well, I wonder what bracket he'll be in?</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.907" offset="14078228">Will somebody go to the phone and call H. R. Block, maybe he can help us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.546" offset="14092752">What do we do with this?</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.998" offset="14102574">It's already enough confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.262" offset="14107590">I say that there must be evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.231" offset="14119502">And if the Court is just going to issue a ukase, a decree, that says, evidence or not, the instruction should be granted, then how do we do this in the face of the Penrod cases, Starnes and Johnson cases, where the Court has ruled... I was the lawyer that tried those also, unfortunately... that inflation cannot be considered?</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.331" offset="14203929">Well, what is more speculative than what is going to happen to us taxwise?</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.470" offset="14224409">Is inflation more speculative?</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.174" offset="14231306">It's omitted because even evidence is omitted in a diversity case, which that was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.578" offset="14256906">So, I am asking this Court to confine Liepelt to what it's meant to be, the interpretation of a federal statute, and a death case at that, where the net pecuniary loss is the damage issue involved; and not to insert it into the common law tort action where there are other elements of damages; and certainly to hold that there's no jurisdiction and to consider the fact of the injustice that will occur to Gaedecke if this case is reversed, and if this Court holds that exclusive jurisdiction lies in the federal courts.</text>
