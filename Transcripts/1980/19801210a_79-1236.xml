            <text syncTime="23.835" offset="246323">The issue presented for decision in this case arises in the context of an employment discrimination suit commenced under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and 42 U.S.C. 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.767" offset="298045">It is a case of first impression for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.891" offset="310584">The Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit sitting en banc with Circuit Judge Hall writing the opinion for the majority, held in the decision of that court that the petitioners could not appeal an order of the district court below which rejected the parties' jointly proposed consent decree on the grounds that the injunctive provisions of that decree were in violation of Title VII, and on the grounds that the enforcement of those provisions would violate the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="144.240" offset="727916">First, we believe that the order is appealable as an order denying an injunction under Section 1292(a)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="152.424" offset="760621">Secondly, we believe that it is appealable under the collateral order exception that this Court announced with regard to Section 1291 in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Company.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.780" offset="958107">Also, if Your Honor would take a look at the decision by the 4th Circuit below, it's quite clear that one of the decisions that the 4th Circuit felt was dispositive of the matter was the 2nd Circuit decision in Seigal v. Merrick, which was decided entirely under Section 1291.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.508" offset="1024981">Your Honor, let me give you some of the background to this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="223.083" offset="1043266">Before you do that, counsel, since as I understand the Cohen Doctrine it has to be not related to the merits, if you were successful in appealing this order under the Cohen Doctrine, could you appeal that part that related to the merits, too.</text>

          <turn speaker="napoleon_b_williams_jr" startTime="248.276" stopTime="501.565">
            <label>Mr. Napoleon B. Williams, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="248.276" offset="1144099">Your Honor, I think it's quite clear from the decisions of this Court that once an appellate court has jurisdiction by virtue of the ancillary jurisdiction that the Court has it can then reach out and decide all other issues in the case that require reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.159" offset="1203658">Your Honor, this suit concerns employment discrimination in the tobacco industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.953" offset="1238767">This is an industry which has had a long history of official segregation and discrimination with respect to blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.029" offset="1267084">The parties have reached a proposed consent order in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.121" offset="1291430">This is an order, Your Honor, which was reached after long discussions and after extensive discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.118" offset="1327479">It was a matter that was reached after the parties were quite aware, in part because of the discovery, of the basic strengths and weaknesses of their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.488" offset="1364886">The heart of the consent decree was contained in a series of provisions which enjoin the employer and the unions from further discriminating against the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.763" offset="1422042">Moreover, that consent degree had provisions which require the employer and the unions to take remedial action with respect to changing the seniority and the transfer rules so that those rules will not further discriminate against seasonal workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.912" offset="1498633">In common with other consent decrees, Your Honor, that settlement also had an exculpatory clause whereby the respondents could suffer the injury of a judgment against them without admitting liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.687" offset="1557774">Because this action was a class action, it was necessary to get approval of the district court under Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.184" offset="1603750">The parties by virtue of this rule went to the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.775" offset="1626110">Now, at this point, and for the first time, Your Honor, the parties found themselves at loggerheads with the district court over the question of the legality of the proposed settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.068" offset="1667279">The district court by virtue of its powers under Rule 23(e) decided that the proposed consent decree with respect to those injunctive provisions to which I referred a moment ago was illegal, because those provisions, it said, violated Title VII and the enforcement of those provisions by a federal court, it said, would be arbitrary and capricious actions which would violate the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.757" offset="1794026">Petitioners sought review of that determination in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.708" offset="1817849">The Court of Appeals, however, decided that it was not appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.174" offset="1847629">They said it was not appealable because that decision by the district court was simply what it deemed a step toward trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.795" offset="1886186">That court did not deem the matter to be a decision of the district court which passed on the merits of the action commenced by the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.447" offset="1932788">That was rather surprising, Your Honors, since that same court also said that it was not appealable, no matter what the reasons were for the district court refusing the injunctive decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.708" offset="1981794">Now, let me give you some of the reasons for refusing that decree, which were stated by the district court in the opinion that accompanied this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.874" offset="2022440">First, the district court said that preferential treatment on the basis of race was unlawful except in those cases where the defendants had themselves committed discrimination against those persons who were part of the plaintiffs' class.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.820" offset="2090254">Secondly it said that since all of the seasonal workers were black any relief that was given to seasonal workers would in effect be preferential treatment based upon race and therefore barred, again, by the Fifth Amendment and also by Title VII.</text>

            <text syncTime="514.605" offset="2209372">That's correct, Your Honor, The only reason for going into the merits at all is so that this Court can make a preliminary assessment as to whether or not with respect to the argument under Section 1292(a) the merits were touched upon by the decree, and also to see if the collateral interests which the petitioners claim were adversely affected were separate and apart from those merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="542.550" offset="2321177">Your Honor, we had not asked for a preliminary injunction and in view of the determination made by the district court, it is quite clear that a preliminary injunction would not and could not have been granted, because that court found that there were no vestiges of discrimination to be corrected or remedied.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.587" offset="2397350">And given the fact that it is necessary with respect to a preliminary injunction to establish that you have a prima facie case or that you have a substantial chance of prevailing on the merits, it was clear to the petitioners and I think it would have been clear to the district court as well that burden could not have been met by petitioners.</text>

            <text syncTime="601.198" offset="2555756">No, we did not, Your Honor, but with respect to the denial of the temporary restraining order, I think the law is quite clear that is not appealable under Section 1292(a)(1), although the denial of a preliminary injunction is of course appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.989" offset="2614897">One further thing which the district court said, and I think I basically mentioned this before, Your Honor, is that despite the long history of segregation and discrimination which had existed in the tobacco industry, that there were no vestiges of discrimination to be overcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.480" offset="2700892">Now, as I tried to indicate before to Your Honors, petitioners have two arguments which they wish to present to this Court, one based on Section 1292(a)(1) and one based on the collateral order doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.430" offset="2748644">Common to these arguments are certain policy considerations which I think must be kept in mind as you make a determination as to whether or not this order was appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.908" offset="2786574">The first point which I want to emphasize is that there comes a time in every lawsuit when the parties have to make a basic decision as to whether or not this is a case which will be settled or a case which will be litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.060" offset="2847178">Petitioners believe that sound judicial administration requires that artificial barriers not be put in the place of parties attempting to reach settlement in a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.710" offset="2901826">Whether a settlement can be reached in any case, Your Honor, is a function of many factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.536" offset="2933069">One factor that the parties will always consider is the expense of further litigation, especially the expense of further litigation in relationship to the expenses which have already been incurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.717" offset="2993882">Another factor... and this is a factor, we think, Your Honor, which is quite important in racial discrimination cases and in labor management cases, and that is the desirability which the parties have to keep down forces of civil strife in the workplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.287" offset="3068174">We think, Your Honor, that this is one of the reasons why the Congress of the United States has endorsed the idea that voluntary settlement and cooperation should be preferred means of resolving, racial discrimination cases brought under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.045" offset="3139123">A third factor which affects settlement possibilities would be the parties' assessment of their chances of winning or losing a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.026" offset="3179038">Now, this is an assessment, Your Honor, which will of course depend upon the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.055" offset="3203175">The further a lawsuit progresses, the more likely the parties will tend to reach a different assessment as to their chances of prevailing, and therefore the terms of a settlement will vary with the progress of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.782" offset="3270153">Therefore, Your Honor, in a case like this, if the parties are denied the settlement that they themselves want and are forced to litigate further then the parties are being put in a position whereby they may never be able to retrieve the opportunity which they once had.</text>

            <text syncTime="808.677" offset="3385719">Well, I think, Your Honor, in light of your past decisions, it is quite clear that one of the reasons why this Court has decided that piecemeal adjudication is bad is because of the expense and the time that it consumes, and also the cost to the parties and the Court and the public interest as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.873" offset="3458444">And here one of the factors we're considering is the question of cost and the question of time and expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.511" offset="3489059">So, in this particular instance, Your Honor, I think that where you have parties who do not themselves want to litigate and who are trying not to litigate, that to give them the opportunity not to litigate is the policy that best furthers the policies behind the avoidance of piecemeal litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.361" offset="3576412">If in a case like this, where the district court erects a legal barrier to the parties' ability to settle the case, that matter should be reviewed, we believe, by an appellate court so that the parties can determine if they can or should not go further.</text>

            <text syncTime="886.146" offset="3695531">If an appeal were allowed and if this case were decided favorably to the petitioners, that would be an end to this litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="923.741" offset="3845892">But here you have parties who have been willing, certainly up until now, to settle their claim, so that if it were determined that the district court was wrong in its ascertainment of the legal principles that govern decision in this case, then that would have helped the parties to have resolved this matter prior to the matter coming to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1077.325" offset="4460292">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.137" offset="4467501">More often than not Title VII suits brought by the Government end up in consent decrees, thus encouraging voluntary compliance and maximizing limited federal law enforcement resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.662" offset="4521627">Indeed, before even commencing lawsuits, the Justice Department typically contacts potential defendants and invites them to sit down and discuss settlement, and advises them that should settlement be reached, that agreement must be memorialized in a consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.062" offset="4587247">Thus to the extent that the Government is forced to try cases which but for the district court's unreasoned objection would result in a settlement that's fair to the defendants and that advances the rights of the parties, our ability to vigorously enforce Title VII and related statutes is seriously undermined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.193" offset="4679720">Now, we submit that this is appealed from... is appealed both as an order refusing an injunction and as a collateral order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1212.849" offset="5002385">I can do it but it's going to stretch me a bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.847" offset="5014401">Common to all appealability theories, in our view, is the question of whether or not the order at issue is reviewable following final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.544" offset="5069154">As my brother Mr. Williams indicated, settlements are based upon the parties' assessment of the strength and weaknesses of their own cases, their assessment of the facts that the court is likely to find credible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.821" offset="5122235">After the evidence is in, those perceptions change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.556" offset="5133206">Indeed, they're replaced by knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of cases, of the parties' respective cases, by knowledge of what aspects of your... what vulnerabilities in your own case have managed to escape detection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.097" offset="5183361">And once the final judgment is in, as a practical matter, the Court of Appeals can never return to the state of facts or perceptions that existed at the time the consent decree was entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.575" offset="5233307">Because if the litigated judgment is not defective for reasons under it, in order to return to the settlement proposal that arguably was improperly rejected by the district court, the Court of Appeals would in essence have to base its reversal on facts other than those proved at trial, and on merits other than those, if they appear following a fully litigated case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.970" offset="5358904">Nor can prejudgment review be presumed as the Court of Appeals did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.888" offset="5386489">There's no parallel in this kind of situation to Rule 23(c)(1) in the class action context where the rule invites the court to periodically reconsider the propriety of the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.493" offset="5432987">Certainly a refusal of a consent decree is final as to the terms in that particular consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.382" offset="5456497">Moreover, the notion that the Court of Appeals touched upon of reconsideration of the consent decree, in this case by the district court, is meaningless in cases such as this one, and such as the City of Alexandria case which we cite in our brief, in which the district court premised their refusal to enter the decree on their view that the decree itself has unlawful provisions and has no basis in fact, because there's no admission of liability on the part of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.541" offset="5581154">Even in a case where the court premises its refusal to enter the decree on more equitable kinds of considerations rather than legal, reconsideration... the possibility that order may be reconsidered at some point by the district court is not an appropriate basis for denying appealability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.156" offset="5679583">For example, the case of Santana v. Collazo, a case that began in the District Court of Puerto Rico and that ultimately wound up in the First Circuit Court of Appeals, Index No. 79-1531, the private plaintiffs and the Justice Department as intervenors on their side submitted three successive, entered into three successive consent decrees with their adversaries, who were the authorities in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico responsible for the juvenile justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.144" offset="5803508">On each occasion... the first occasion was the district court asked the parties to make certain modifications in the consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.922" offset="5838617">The parties returned to the table, made modifications, and in each instance the Court of Appeals rejected that consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.873" offset="5862440">So even where the court ostensibly is not basing its rejection on a view of the scope of Title VII, this motion for reconsideration is not the boon that one would guess from the Court of Appeals--</text>

            <text syncTime="1546.966" offset="6338809">--Indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.997" offset="6342989">And it is certainly true that when parties come to the point where they are willing to agree to terms of a settlement, they are much more inclined to abide by them voluntarily than not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.820" offset="6382277">However, the Justice Department routinely enters into consent decrees because they are enforceable by, among other sanctions, contempt, and because in the event of changed circumstances it's often much more useful to put the question of whether or not the agreement should be modified or indeed dissolved to an impartial judicial tribunal rather than to parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.014" offset="6479035">So while it is certainly possible that parties could enter into a private agreement, consent decree is in the judgment of the Government a much more useful device all around, from the standpoint of all the parties and the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.619" offset="6529503">I'd like to touch upon briefly, Mr. Chief Justice, your question about which way the evils of piecemeal adjudication cut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.847" offset="6574329">I agree with my brother that the general notion that interlocutory appeals slow down the trial process is not in this context a terribly useful sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.233" offset="6623857">What the parties are trying to do in a consent decree is to end the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.622" offset="6653428">It's true, as Mr. Justice White points out, that the same can be said of the summary judgment motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.775" offset="6678088">But what's left after a summary judgment motion even if a denial is upheld on appeal are only those issues as to which there is legitimate dispute, so that even though there may be a trial afterward it's a very truncated trial, and it's not the same kind of full trial on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.423" offset="6760635">Moreover, there are other independent reasons why this Court unanimously concluded, I think correctly, that a refusal to enter a summary judgment motion is not appealable, and those factors are not present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.415" offset="6828657">Moreover, I don't think that the floodgate of litigation feared by the Court of Appeals is an appropriate, is on balance a reasonable fear, when we're talking about refusals to enter consent decrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.579" offset="6909324">To the extent that other reasonable alternative decrees are available, it seems to me it's in the parties' perceived interests to search out and reach for those agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.699" offset="6953732">The very factors that led the parties enter a settlement in the first place that Mr. Williams outlined and the desire to avoid the expense and delay of litigation would lead them to reach other reasonable agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.944" offset="7006708">The kinds of cases that would result in an appeal are precisely like those at bar where the court's refusal to enter the decree is based upon a misapprehension of the scope of the statute or if the requirements of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.502" offset="7200955">And I think the reading of the two opinions in the 4th Circuit shows exactly the type of jungle that we're getting ourselves into, permitting appeals of the nature that stands before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3234.862" offset="13090417">That's the time that the district... the consent decree was presented and the time that it went... and the appeal time, and the remand back, was a couple of years, and of course, one of the things I wanted to mention was that the evils of piecemeal litigation certainly involve the appellate court getting involved in the trial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.178" offset="13199714">Now, counsel for the petitioners distinguished the Court's decision in Switzerland Cheese on the ground that that was just a denial of motion for summary judgment, that there were material issues of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.643" offset="13245585">But I submit to you that we may have and do have basically the same thing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.719" offset="13269826">If you look at the proposed consent decree, you'll see recitations in there where it's recited that the district court judge has reviewed the extensive discovery, and there was extensive discovery in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.605" offset="13325415">There were numerous depositions and extensive written interrogatories, and production of documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.978" offset="13350910">And it recites that the district court has reviewed the discovery in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.803" offset="13374212">So, the district court in denying entry of a consent decree may very well have done so for principles and on standards which would be quite similar in denying a motion for summary judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3806.171" offset="15375609">Your Honor, we think that a consent decree is needed in addition to any type of agreement that the parties might reach voluntarily in a case like this, in part because of the need, as this Court found in United Steelworkers of America v. Weber, to decide the rights of third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.475" offset="15456902">Secondly, we think that it is needed because of the need for enforcement with respect to those kinds of mandatory things that the parties are supposed to do or not to do.</text>
