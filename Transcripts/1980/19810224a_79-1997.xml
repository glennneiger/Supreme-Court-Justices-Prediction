            <text syncTime="79.235" offset="473048">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="81.733" offset="482974">The issue in this case is, has the practice of the Connecticut Board of Pardons in granting relief to inmates serving what we call straight life sentences in Connecticut... that is, sentences with no court-imposed minimum term... and relief to the extent that the minimum term set by statute is reduced, thereby accelerating the inmates' eligibility to appear before the Connecticut Board of Parole, giving inmates serving such sentences a due process right to the extent that the Board of Pardons must give written explanations of adverse decisions when they deny such relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.886" offset="667608">This is the second occasion upon which we have come to this Court, the parties in this case have come to this Court on the issue of what, if any, kind of a written statement is required when the Board of Pardons denies pardon relief to a so-called lifer in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.125" offset="772620">The first occasion followed a decision in January of 1979 by a panel of the 2nd Circuit which analogized pardons to parole, and held in part that written statements of reasons for denial of parole are part of the due process requirements surrounding parole decisions, this holding was based upon the expectation of inmates in regard to parole possibilities which lead to those inmates acquiring some liberty interest in the parole process.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.045" offset="956208">In May of 1979 this Court decided Greenholtz.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.932" offset="983794">We had petitioned for a writ of certiorari on the January, '79, decision of the 2nd Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.397" offset="1025694">In June of 1979 this Court granted our petition and remanded the case to the 2nd Circuit for further consideration in light of this Court's decision in Greenholtz.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.376" offset="1085567">The same panel of the 2nd Circuit, the same three judges, reconsidered the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.077" offset="1116391">Parties briefed it by order of the 2nd Circuit but there was no oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.246" offset="1141051">Although concluding that the applicable Connecticut statute, Section 18-26 of the Connecticut General Statutes, offered only the mere hope of pardon, that it does not create a legitimate expectation of freedom, and hence does not implicate due process... and in this regard the panel concluded that Section 18-26 contains neither a presumption in favor of pardon nor a list of factors to be considered by the Board of Pardons, and in fact that the statute gave the Board unfettered discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.338" offset="1321400">Despite these conclusions, the court upon reconsideration, affirmed its earlier conclusion, as the consistent issuance of pardons to inmates serving so-called straight life sentences in Connecticut has given inmates serving such sentences a protected liberty interest in the pardons process.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen J. O'Neill</label>
            <text syncTime="398.559" offset="1750331">Well, following the... Mr. Gates is a very knowledgeable man and he has been around in the corrections area in Connecticut for decades... following the decision of the 2nd Circuit and before this Court granted certiorari, we did embark upon a process of reviewing the minutes of the Board's meetings for the past five or six years, I believe, to see if we could put together some kind of a pattern, but we really didn't get all that deeply into it when this Court granted certiorari, and we stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.405" offset="1897661">One thing that interested me in that search is that I don't know that all inmates serving life sentences apply for pardons.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.261" offset="1937159">We get frequent applications from the same inmate, but I wonder if all inmates serving life sentences do in fact apply for pardon, really.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.568" offset="1982298">But anyway, that's not in the record up to this point, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.723" offset="1999017">Following the ordering of the filing of the records, as the Court has indicated, the 2nd Circuit remanded to the district court to determine how many years a lifer must serve before the probability of a pardon becomes so significant as to give rise to a protected liberty interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.027" offset="2092221">The finding or conclusion of the 2nd Circuit that the consistent issuance of pardons... again, from the facts in the record, somewhere around 75 percent... and it's also referred to as the regularity of their issuance... is again, as I indicated, based on the testimony of Mr. Gates.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.358" offset="2221475">In Board of Regents v. Roth, relied upon by the majority of this Court in Greenholtz, this Court held in part that the Fourteenth Amendment's procedural protection of property is the safeguard of the security of interest that a person has already acquired in specific benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.128" offset="2328577">It further held that to have a property interest in a benefit a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it, he must have more than a unilateral expectation of it, he must instead have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.915" offset="2419692">It is a purpose of the ancient institution of property to protect those claims upon which people rely in their daily lives, reliance that must not be arbitrarily undermined.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.784" offset="2475177">In the Leis case, Leis v. Flynt, this Court further held that a claim of entitlement under state law to be enforceable must be derived from statute or legal rule or through a mutually explicit understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.866" offset="2595549">There simply is no statute, legal rule, for a mutually explicit understanding such that lifers in Connecticut have a protected or a legitimate claim of entitlement to pardon relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.701" offset="2694919">In Roth itself there was at least a suggestion that most of the teachers hired on a yearly basis were in fact rehired, and yet that suggestion was not deemed significant enough to give the teacher a legitimate claim of entitlement, thus invoking due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.062" offset="2820306">Indeed, in Greenholtz itself, in the dissenting opinions, there was detailed reference to parole statistics around the country which showed, in part: that the history of New York was that 75 percent of persons eligible for parole were in fact paroled, and that the figure went as high as 92 percent in other states around the country; that the figures nationally show that some 70 percent of inmates released to the community were in fact released to the community via the parole process.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.870" offset="3019568">And yet, the majority of this Court held that there was no legitimate claim of entitlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.898" offset="3059692">Indeed, even other panels of the 2nd Circuit have in Pugliese and Boothe acknowledged that high percentages of parole releases do not give somebody a legitimate claim of entitlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.556" offset="3186334">I seem to be the only attorney who has lost this issue, at least in the 2nd Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.879" offset="3231578">In short, even if the Connecticut Board of Pardons may be generous in the exercise of its authorities, its record such as it appears can hardly be interpreted as conveying the message to an inmate serving a life sentence that he has something that he can rely on, that he has something that will not be taken away from him unless he does something about it, or unless certain conditions can be established, which are the grounds upon which such a legitimate claim of entitlement must be premised.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.157" offset="3420705">Further, in Schick v. Reed, this Court dealt with the authority of the United States Constitution of the President to grant pardons.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.789" offset="3503252">In Schick the Court characterized one who seeks a pardon as a person who is petitioning for mercy, and held that the President's pardoning power was plenary, in that it entailed the authority to reduce or alter the sentence which conditions which... which themselves are constitutionally unobjectionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.371" offset="3621534">Since the pardoning process is plenary, it would seem to be conditioned only upon constitutionally unobjectionable reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.820" offset="3675346">It would seem that the denial of the pardon, similarly, is plenary, provided pardons are not denied, or pardon relief is not denied for constitutionally impermissible reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.954" offset="3731875">There is really no claim in this case that inmates are denied pardon relief in Connecticut or that the petitioners in this case are denied pardon relief in Connecticut for constitutionally impermissible reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.088" offset="3796450">The decisions of this Court which have found, in the inmate context, which have found a constitutionally protected claim of entitlement, are really not applicable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.354" offset="3949528">In Wolff, good time was given to the inmate, by law, in Nebraska; good time could be deducted only for failure to obey the rules of the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.286" offset="4013266">Thus the inmate had something that he could count on, and from my experience in the Department of Corrections in Connecticut, inmates do count on good time, which should only be taken from them if they do something wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.076" offset="4076378">That's not true of an applicant for a pardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.215" offset="4088917">I know that inmates when they are sentenced expect or base their pleas or base their defenses, or even base their conduct in prison, on the expectation that they're going to get pardon relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.835" offset="4147431">In Morrissey, the inmate had a parole; he was in the community; he was with his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.722" offset="4182958">For all but some minor restrictions he was a free man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.779" offset="4223186">It's understandable that in Morrissey this Court held that before those freedoms could be taken from him, he was entitled to some kind of a due process hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.524" offset="4274177">Again, the lifer in Connecticut has no such reasons in terms of anticipating a pardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.348" offset="4321511">In short, we claim that the decision of the 2nd Circuit should be reversed.</text>
