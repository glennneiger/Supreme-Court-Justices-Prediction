            <text syncTime="20.415" offset="231980">Thirty years ago was the last time this Court had the opportunity in a constitutional contest to consider the issue of reverse discrimination in employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.612" offset="276806">At that time this Court and the California Supreme Court agreed that a group could not force upon an employer the premise that that employer had to have a particular racial composition of that employer's work force which would match the service population.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.106" offset="350784">Then too the Court was looking at a case from California.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.260" offset="371369">The case was Hughes v. Superior Court of California, 339 U.S. 460.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.037" offset="402507">And at that time the employer was Lucky Stores, and it was an attempt to have Lucky's have its store in Richmond, California, have its work force mirror the racial composition of the people who shop there, in Richmond, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.858" offset="477740">And this Court, and the California Supreme Court, sustained a permanent injunction declaring at that time that such a goal of requiring such mirroring was an unlawful purpose as articulated under California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.275" offset="539389">Why, then, 30 years later are we back?</text>
            <text syncTime="101.772" offset="557361">The reason that we are back obviously has to do with the intervening events of the past decades, intervening struggles that counsel on both sides of the case here agree with, and support.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.968" offset="630190">What has come out of the struggles of the intervening years, of these intervening decades, has been a strategy of how to indeed achieve the results we all want to see, which is to see people judged without regard to their race or color but simply with regard to their abilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.256" offset="715349">Before you is a strategy of how to get there which petitioners feel in fact is a step away from the society, from the goals that we all want to see.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.549" offset="768535">What we have before you is the result of a strategy of social engineering wherein the California Department of Corrections has attempted to have its work force mirror racially the inmate population or service population of the Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.884" offset="849828">Justice Skelly Wright in a recent Law Review article in the University of Chicago Law Review has challenged those of us who oppose reverse discrimination saying that we talk in only abstract principles, but we don't get down to talking about social realities and, indeed, the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.844" offset="933733">I want to take on that challenge and speak of the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.621" offset="960796">The case before you is not about remedying prior discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.995" offset="978350">That is not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.448" offset="988068">In 1974 when the Department adopted its affirmative action program and then started to carry it out as we had described, in fact, black persons were over-represented in the work force of the Department of Corrections, as were orientals and as were people who would be called "others".</text>
            <text syncTime="231.330" offset="1075630">This was not a lily-white work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.954" offset="1086184">This was indeed an integrated work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.812" offset="1097573">There has never been the slightest hint in the record that there was not already sufficient minorities and women throughout the Department to handle any sorts of peculiar or specialized assignments that the Department somehow requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.867" offset="1169775">The program here was carried out not by low-level people who somehow misunderstood the goals and objectives of the Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.708" offset="1213139">It was carried out at the direction, and indeed the energetic behest of top management.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.797" offset="1245531">Top management said that the goals would be met "or else".</text>
            <text syncTime="279.123" offset="1266846">It's the Director of the Department talking.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.293" offset="1279490">The Director stated that if goals were not met,</text>
            <text syncTime="284.792" offset="1289521">"their own positions might be on the line. "</text>
            <text syncTime="288.838" offset="1305717">On this record any distinction between supposed goals and quotas is an illusory distinction.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.180" offset="1471020">And indeed, the evidence was voluminous that the policies being implemented went also to the question of hiring.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.771" offset="1501426">For example, people who applied for jobs had their races secretly coded on their application forms at the behest of the Department.</text>

            <text syncTime="1018.215" offset="4223176">And indeed, they reaffirm, they reaffirm explicitly that even though LEAA changed its regs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.431" offset="4252015">so as to not set as goals the "service population", nonetheless the California Department of Corrections reaffirmed that it was having as its goals the inmate population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.691" offset="4301126">So, if anything, it's more emphatic as to what the social engineering goals of this plan are as we stand and sit here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.983" offset="4346265">In the record in this case, obviously the Court is familiar with the explicit set-aside, and the fact that out of the mouths of the Department's only witnesses, the Department acknowledged that it was hiring, was promoting lesser qualified people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.911" offset="4445949">That is to say, if people were somehow within a reasonable range of qualifications, no matter whether the Caucasian was more qualified, the minority would get the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.766" offset="4497357">I suggest that that situation is similar to the one described by Justice Powell in the decision in Arlington Heights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.668" offset="4532989">Justice Powell did not use the term, "but for causation", although we have used it in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.792" offset="4557439">But in Arlington Heights, Justice Powell and the opinion of the Court made it clear that if without the tainted or improper motivation the decision would have been different, then the act of the public entity should be illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.079" offset="4634657">As a matter of fact, there the Court said that if the plaintiff could show any improper aspects of the decision-making process... here it would be consideration of race... the burden shifted to the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.418" offset="4687947">The burden shifted to the defendants to prove that without the improper motive the decision would have been the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.009" offset="4718353">Here by testimony of the Department's own top management, the Department acknowledges that the improper motive, the consideration of race, is the changing factor, the "but-for" factor that puts a woman or a minority ahead of the Caucasian or the male.</text>

I think it's '75, not '76, Michigan Law Review, indeed sets forth those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.869" offset="5169749">So I would say that indeed this Court could reverse a dismissal of a state court saying there was no standing, if this Court found that the federal standards had been met.</text>

            <text syncTime="1308.535" offset="5384476">There's evidence in this record that not every correctional officer or minority correctional officer wishes to consider himself or herself a specialist in dealing with members of his own race.</text>

            <text syncTime="1769.975" offset="7230184">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.177" offset="7243036">This case was tried in the Superior Court in San Francisco before this Court had rendered its decision in Bakke; indeed, before this Court had rendered its decision in the United Jewish Organization v. Carey case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.046" offset="7310536">The sole issue on which the parties focused when this case was tried in Superior Court was a question open at the time as to whether or not it was permissible for the Department of Corrections under any circumstances to give any consideration to the question of race or sex in hiring and promotional practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.472" offset="7412205">The petitioners before the Superior Court argued that it was not, that absolutely no consideration could be given under any circumstances, that race and sex were absolutely impermissible considerations, and the Superior Court accepted that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.607" offset="7480750">That it did so is clear from the record but it is made very simply clear by looking at the notice of intended decision of the Superior Court, which is in Appendix D to the petition, the Court framed the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.320" offset="7543653">The Department at that time defended its policy on the ground that race and sex were not the only factors, and then quoting, said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.394" offset="7583882">"Plaintiffs on the other hand assert that the hiring or promotion of a person based in whole or in part on sex or racial background or ancestry is unconstitutional and void. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.671" offset="7632992">"The Court agrees with plaintiffs. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.841" offset="7637694">And the court went on, then, to enter an injunction, which is Appendix G to the petition, which prohibited the Department from giving any preference, advantage, or benefit based on race, color, sex, or national origin in hiring or promotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.007" offset="7714389">And it is that judgment in that injunction which the petitioners are asking this Court to reinstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.080" offset="7746677">That is their request, if you look at the conclusion of both the briefs they filed in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.736" offset="7765276">The Court of Appeal in California, of course, reversed that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.983" offset="7786278">It held that race or sex may be considered if necessary to serve a compelling state interest which the Court of Appeal held the orderly administration of prisons to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.490" offset="7856286">The Court of Appeal's reversal of that decision had the effect of remanding the case to the Superior Court for a new trial necessarily, I believe, raising the question asked by Justice White a few moments ago, whether or not we even have a final decision here in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.140" offset="7934863">And I submit that most clearly the Court does not have a final decision here and there is no jurisdiction to go on and to consider this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2142.060" offset="8718536">But no case... and I stress that neither our research nor the research of the several amicus briefs which address this point, nor indeed petitioners themselves, found any case where you have a final decision in a situation where further state court proceedings remained on the very federal issues that are involved, and which the petitioners are seeking to have reviewed in this Court.</text>
