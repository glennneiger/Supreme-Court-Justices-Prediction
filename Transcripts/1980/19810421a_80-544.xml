            <text syncTime="192.781" offset="910860">The record does, however, show that there was no interchange between the various facilities serviced by First National.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.215" offset="944610">First National, as Your Honors, I'm sure, are aware, was a service corporation which did cleaning and maintenance work in nursing homes and old age homes within the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.321" offset="993094">We have been fortunate in that we have had the benefit of two Supreme Court decisions in this area, one entitled Fibreboard, wherein the Supreme Court had the opportunity of affirming a decision of Mr. Chief Justice Burger who was then sitting in the circuit court, and in which Mr. Justice Stevens wrote a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.419" offset="1105420">Thereafter, about one year later, this Court had an opportunity to examine the case in Darlington.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.245" offset="1132797">Darlington concerned a partial secession of operations and it arose under Section 3 of the National Labor Relations Act and not under Section 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.286" offset="1192878">I think it can be fairly stated that as we view the decisions of this Court in Fibreboard through its rationale in Darlington as interpreted by the majority of the circuits, and even, I might suggest, by the two circuits who came to different conclusions and by the National Labor Relations Board, which comes to a different conclusion at face, what seems to me to be apparent, that there evolves a concept of law which is really what I would suggest is the status of the law today.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.956" offset="1367585">And that is to require an employer to bargain about the matter which is within his entrepreneurial control would be in the permissive area as opposed to mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.792" offset="1434981">When there are replacements performing the affected work as part of an integrated work process who are still controlled by the original employer, then a change in that original work is a mandatory subject of bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.191" offset="1520558">I believe that when Fibreboard talked about subcontracting and subcontracting in terms of the employer still exercising control, and all that the employer did in Fibreboard was to replace one group of employees with another group of employees, that's what was meant: an employer replacing employees performing the affected work as part of the integrated work process, who are still controlled by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.864" offset="1643229">And Fibreboard correctly stated that that subject would have been mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.503" offset="1669770">However, if there is a secession of the work and there are no longer replacements performing that work, or if on the other hand as in Darlington the employer withdraws himself as an employer of the affected work, then in those instances I would submit the cases almost uniformly hold that the bargaining would then be permissive.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.569" offset="1786067">The hard cases, Your Honors, where the courts very often look to the possibility of taint of union animus, are really cases where the court is trying in my opinion to look to see whether there is a subterfuge, whether the employer is still becoming the employer, whether the work is really still being done by an ally or where there is really a continuation of the same employment relationship but with different employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.540" offset="1917933">That is not the case which is before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.664" offset="1930472">As I stated, the petitioner services at best four facilities in the New York area.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.442" offset="1961505">It goes into those facilities with its own employees, it cleans the facilities, it receives as compensation from the nursing home a weekly sum which is the equivalent of its out-of-pocket expenses for the payment of its own employees plus a management fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.089" offset="2044157">In this case the management fee should have been $500 by agreement at the beginning of the arrangement with Greenpark.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.134" offset="2068294">It was $250 when the petitioner requested Greenpark to replace it to the $500.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.303" offset="2100999">Greenpark refused and the petitioner ceased operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.442" offset="2117508">It left, it terminated its relationship as an employer performing that service, or, in the case of General Motors, of producing the item.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.593" offset="2162126">So I would suggest to you that when there is a true partial, or a true total closing... I'm sorry?</text>

            <text syncTime="535.753" offset="2282811">Your Honor, it is not part of this record because the effects bargaining was stipulated to at the lower level and it was acceded by all parties that there should and is mandatory bargaining on the effects, clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.389" offset="2337355">And the reason for that is because we should be looking to the policy of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="560.540" offset="2381972">And it says, in effect, that there is a desire to have collective bargaining, and that the parties should recognize under law each of others, one another's legitimate rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.487" offset="2453757">The legitimate right of an employee, I submit, is to look to the work which he has traditionally been doing for an employer and say, Mr. Employer, if you continue to do this work, if you continue to be an employer who has control of this work, then I have a legitimate right to want to continue to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.432" offset="2529512">If you want to take that legitimate right away from me, then at least talk to me about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.304" offset="2544976">On the other hand, the legitimate right of an employer is to say, like an employee can say, I quit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1385.098" offset="5680192">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.785" offset="5694926">First of all, I'd like to clear up a few things about the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.216" offset="5756679">The petitioner had a maintenance contract with the Greenpark Nursing Home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.509" offset="5797848">Under that contract Greenpark paid the labor cost of the petitioner's employees plus a weekly management fee which was originally $500 and then was cut down to $250.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.781" offset="5886873">Petitioner experienced difficulties in making out with the reduced management fee and wanted Greenpark to increase it back to a $500 weekly fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.769" offset="6002857">In the meantime, the union was certified by the Labor Board as the representative of petitioner's employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.574" offset="6078090">The union made a demand for bargaining which petitioner did not respond to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.445" offset="6117587">When it could not work out its monetary difficulties with Greenpark, it gave notice that it would terminate the contract, which was terminable on 30 days notice, and then two days before the end of the 30 days it told the employees that they were going to be terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.620" offset="6242243">And that was the first word that the union had that petitioner had a monetary problem.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="1533.633" offset="6274321">Since you emphasize the two days, what if they had given them 30 days notice, as soon as they terminated with the nursing home?</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.739" offset="6302743">Would that make it different?</text>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="1542.692" offset="6310579">Well, had they given them 30 days, it is conceivable, given the type of monetary problem that petitioner had, that the union would have been able to bargain over ways of reducing the labor costs that would have enabled petitioner to remain with the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.381" offset="6433250">Because petitioner did not just go out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.458" offset="6453626">It remained in business at its other, at the other nursing homes that it was servicing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.861" offset="6483197">It was willing to remain in business here, according to the testimony of one of its top officials, if the union could work out the problem, but the point is that at that time there was no time left to negotiate, because the petitioner took the position that it was under no duty to bargain with the union about its decision to terminate its operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.717" offset="6666681">Now, as far as the effects bargaining is concerned, it is true that two years after the contract was terminated and when the case was pending in the court of appeals, that the parties did engage in effects bargaining and according to the stipulation in the record some provision for severance pay to the employees was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.545" offset="6809936">I think the facts of this case illustrate why in the Board's view a blanket exemption from the statute for so-called partial closing decisions is not necessary to... well, first of all, it does not effectuate the statutory purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3538.032" offset="14291928">Because the contract between Greenpark, which was the nursing home, and First National, says that the nursing home repays the out-of-pocket expenses of First National plus a management fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.917" offset="14343441">So, if you lower the out-of-pocket expenses it doesn't help First National.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.212" offset="14368623">And I believe that that is a critical point that the dissent in the circuit below makes and in reality is why the presumption is really not a rebuttable presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.708" offset="14410628">It's an irrebuttable presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.160" offset="14420450">Because, what happened in this very case is the dilemma that the management community would be faced with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.860" offset="14447200">It would be faced with bargaining or making a decision to bargain or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.529" offset="14461933">And then, with the benefit of hindsight, a court or a board would after the fact look at the case and say, oh, you should have bargained.</text>

            <text syncTime="3594.302" offset="14516999">And so I suggest to you that the Ozark rule, the presumption of the the 3rd Circuit in Brockway, the presumption of the 2nd Circuit in First National, all become unworkable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3787.712" offset="15290641">It seems to me incompatible to say, by the Labor Board, that the Labor Board would not require an employer to bargain about his decision to go totally out of business and move to Florida, but would require that employer to bargain about a decision to close his New York plant and continue in a Florida plant that he may have operated before that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.418" offset="15413417">To me it is incongruous.</text>
