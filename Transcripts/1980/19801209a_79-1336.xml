            <text syncTime="35.098" offset="285872">The issues are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.129" offset="294022">First, have provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act preempted state court damage actions founded on state law in the areas of provision of interstate transportation service that are involved in the facts of this case?</text>

            <text syncTime="70.880" offset="429023">Prior to entry of the judgment of the Iowa trial court, the Commerce Commission ruled that the cessation of interstate service over the Railroad's line was caused by conditions that were beyond the control of the Railroad, and the Railroad's issue preclusion defense contends that in order for the respondent's state law theories to be sustained the respondent would have to obtain an Iowa trial court ruling that the conditions that led to the cessation of service were in fact within the control, or could have been prevented by the Railroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="131.965" offset="673320">The Railroad's abandonment application was filed after the respondent had decided to go out of business and after the respondent had ceased operating his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.038" offset="725669">The Railroad then filed an application for permission to abandon, and a year and half after service ceased over the trackage, the respondent filed an action in state court seeking damages grounded on state law theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.514" offset="799544">This case involves the Supremacy Clause, it involves interstate commerce provisions which require interstate carriers to provide interstate service, transportation service; Commerce Act provisions which require interstate carriers to provide interstate car service; it involves the provisions of the Act which regulate the abandonment and extension of lines, and also the provisions of the Commerce Act that entitle a shipper to commence an action for damages either before the Interstate Commerce Commission or in federal district court where they can prove a violation of the Commerce Act on the part of interstate carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.043" offset="977699">Kalo did not commence its action before the Commission or in federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.150" offset="1002045">Instead, it went to state court and seeks damages under a state car service theory, a state car service statute, a state negligence statute, and common law tortious interference.</text>

            <text syncTime="282.169" offset="1274136">--No, you could not file an action claiming violation of the Interstate Commerce Act in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.009" offset="1309558">And here is the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.963" offset="1317291">The Commerce Act has been construed in Puritan, among others, which is a case relied upon by the Respondent... it's been construed to restrict Section 9 damage actions to the forums set cut in Section 9, which are the Commerce Commission and federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.843" offset="1408824">And there are good reasons for doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.593" offset="1415824">First of all, if you restrict it to federal district court or the Commerce Commission, you are going to have one system of federal law which is going to govern damage actions as well as the other regulatory functions of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.884" offset="1477055">However, if you allow the Commerce Act, if you allow damage actions for violation of the Commerce Act to be filed in state court, you are essentially allowing each state to create a separate regulatory system consisting of damage actions and the U.S. Supreme Court faced a similar situation in San Diego Unions v. Garmon, where the U.S. Supreme Court recognized that if it permitted state damage actions to be filed by an employer for economic loss sustained because of peaceful picketing, not violent picketing, then in effect it would be allowing a state court system to create a system of regulation by damage actions which would create a separate body of law competing with the body of law that is created under the federal judicial system interpreting and applying the National Labor Relations Act.</text>

            <label>Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="403.432" offset="1759178">But it's one thing to say that the body of law has to be common and uniform; but it's another thing to say that concurrent jurisdiction exists between the state courts and the federal courts in applying that uniform body of law.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bruce_e_johnson" startTime="419.817" stopTime="564.963">
            <label>Mr. Bruce E. Johnson</label>
            <text syncTime="419.817" offset="1824798">The Esch Car Service Act, and in the context of this case, more importantly, I think, the Transportation Act of 1920 evidence a new and radically different philosophy of Congress with regard to regulation of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.965" offset="1901389">The Transportation Act of 1920 was designed to give plenary control, exclusive jurisdiction to the federal system to govern the provision of interstate transportation service, the abandonment of lines, the extension of lines, and the reason for that, the Court in Transit Commission v. U. S. stated, is because it had been found that concurrent state and federal jurisdiction in the areas of interstate commerce addressed in the 1920 Act had been found to be detrimental to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.935" offset="2045271">The competing local interest in this case, the respondent's local interest, is economic loss, and if you analyze his state law claims, although the claims of the respondent are couched in terms of state law, they are claiming damage to their business because of cessation of interstate transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.208" offset="2134296">And each state law claim requires proof of two things: first, the existence of a duty on the part of the Railroad to provide interstate transportation service; and secondly, to prove that such a duty was breached by the Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.342" offset="2206812">It is undisputed... and this is the crucial and central fact of this case... it is undisputed that every rail shipment to and from Kalo's factory was in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.727" offset="2260415">Now, if there is no duty on the part of the Railroad after April 4, 1973, when the line became physically impassable, there is no duty on the part of the Railroad after that date to provide interstate transportation service, then Kalo's state law claims fall, because they all presuppose the existence of that duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.204" offset="2346306">This is not a situation where there is a physical injury or something of that nature where there may have existed a stronger local interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="564.963" offset="2405343">Would your position here be any different if ten percent of the shipments were intrastate?</text>

          <turn speaker="bruce_e_johnson" startTime="568.898" stopTime="668.125">
            <label>Mr. Bruce E. Johnson</label>
            <text syncTime="568.898" offset="2421121">That issue has been addressed by some state courts and that percentage; basically, in state courts, most of the state courts have said, that's not enough intrastate commerce to set aside the overriding national interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.001" offset="2493532">But I think the way to determine that question is to look at Section 1-17(a) of the Commerce Act, which says the states' regulation of intrastate commerce is invalid if it conflicts with a lawful order of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.146" offset="2586110">And I think that the cases indicate that under the Commerce Act, the Commerce Act will govern even intrastate commerce if the effect of intrastate commerce on interstate commerce is so great that it creates an undue burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.499" offset="2663537">In this case we have no intrastate rail shipments, it's strictly interstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.248" offset="2682450">There's never been any factual dispute about that in this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.245" offset="2702512">And the respondent has characterized this as a negligence case, a car service case, common law tortious interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.740" offset="2748487">But none of those state law theories hold any weight unless the respondent proves a duty to provide interstate rail service to its plant site.</text>

            <text syncTime="698.643" offset="2940017">The Esch Car Service Act was enacted to preempt state law, and Missouri Pacific Railroad v. Stroud in 1926 stated that state law has no application to provision of car service in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.306" offset="3022669">Now, the Federal Courthouse in Fort Dodge is four blocks from the State Courthouse and the Interstate Commerce Act provides that if there is a violation of the federal car service provisions or transportation service provisions, that may be attacked in the Commerce Commission or in federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.078" offset="3117754">And it's attacked under the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="765.147" offset="3206048">And, as I indicated earlier, the reason for... in addition to the reason for having interstate service questions determined under one act, the Interstate Commerce Act, there is another reason, and that is that the philosophy of the Interstate Commerce Act has been to place the interests in forming a national transportation system, an economically efficient national transportation system, over and above the competing local interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="813.596" offset="3399877">The abandonment proceeding... the ruling of the Commerce Commission buttresses our argument in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.875" offset="3433000">First, before theme was any trial court ruling... which, by the way, the trial court ruled in our favor and the Court of Appeals saw fit to reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.060" offset="3465705">Before there was any trial court judgment, the Commerce ruled, the Commerce Commission ruled that our cessation of service was not due to any condition that we could have controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.647" offset="3512099">Now, that puts the Court of Appeals of Iowa's ruling directly in conflict with Section 1-17(a) which says that even regulation of intrastate service is invalid if it conflicts with the lawful order of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.250" offset="3578450">Here we have the Court of Appeals saying that a Webster County District Court can regulate by damage action interstate transportation service in direct contradiction to an order of the ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.650" offset="3640099">The Respondent admitted in its brief that central and necessary to its state law claim is a finding by the trial court that the cessation of service was due to conditions within the control of the Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.237" offset="3706450">And the ICC has found just the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.503" offset="3715540">So having followed the Interstate Commerce Act, followed the provisions, gone to the ICC, participated in a proceeding in which Kalo was a party, and having our conduct approved by the ICC, we now find ourselves in the situation of being subjected to exposure of a state law damage action which can be successful by the respondent's admission in its brief only if a trial court reaches a finding opposite to the finding that ICC has already made in a lawful proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.675" offset="3852213">So I think that the ICC's order should be issue preclusive, even if there were jurisdiction in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.657" offset="3880112">But more importantly, I think that there should be no jurisdiction permitted to a state court when you're talking about simply provision of interstate transportation service.</text>

            <text syncTime="1178.105" offset="4857927">This Court has held in a number of decisions interpreting the Esch Car Service Act, a statute which my colleague referred to, and also the Transportation Act of 1920, which brought for the first time extension and abandonment of rail lines under the jurisdiction of the Federal Government, under federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.953" offset="4977255">This Court has held that the provisions of these Acts vests exclusive responsibility for the regulation of car service and cessation of service in the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.823" offset="5036814">Principally among those and on which we largely rest our case in this proceeding are this Court's decisions in Colorado v. United States, in the Purcell case, in the Transit Commission case, and in the case of Mo.</text>

            <text syncTime="1248.391" offset="5139005">The Government has urged this Court to grant certiorari and appears today to present a single point, but one that is of extreme importance to the Commission in performing its responsibilities under the provisions I have just referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.505" offset="5239524">That point is that the recognition of a state or common law cause of action for damages in state court in matters relating to an interstate railroad cessation of service would undermine the accomplishment of federal objectives embodied in the abandonment and car service provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1322.282" offset="5434606">I mean, that seems to me exactly the point here, that a state damage action is asserted on a matter involving either car service or abandonment, both of which have been found to be within the exclusive province of the Federal Government and the Commission to regulate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1662.600" offset="6795900">Respondents in the Court, of Appeals relied through their proposition supporting an award of damages ultimately entirely on three decisions of this Court, decided in 1915 and 1916, interpreting Section 22 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.965" offset="6889313">We believe those cases are all distinguishable on the ground that no question of the reasonableness of the Railroad's challenged practice was before the courts, and hence if one were to take a primary jurisdiction approach to the issue of preemption, there would have been nothing to defer to the Commission's primary jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.140" offset="7006029">However, more fundamentally, we submit that those decisions ought to be found not to have survived the enactment cf the Esch Car Service Act and the Transportation Act of 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.055" offset="7081679">As I have indicated, this court has held that those enactments vested sole jurisdiction or responsibility, I should say, in the Commission for regulation of the matters of car service and cessation of rail service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.546" offset="7163704">This Court has consistently recognized that Section 22 is not to be read literally to absolutely preserve common law rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.619" offset="7223994">It's early decision in Texas &amp; Pacific Railway v. Abilene Cotton Oil Company found that to hold that a state right of damages survived because of Section 22 would be destructive to the pervasive scheme of rate regulation embodied within the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.937" offset="7317199">And hence it ought to be found hot to survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.452" offset="7331305">We believe that the Esch Car Service Act and the Transportation Act cf 1920 similarly encompass a pervasive scheme of regulation, where interstate commerce and interstate railroads are involved, of all matters relating to the cessation of rail service by such an interstate carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.593" offset="7483860">We ask this Court to find, as it did in... or to hold as it did in the rate area, that no such remedy survives in connection with these matters under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.210" offset="7554286">Anything less than that, a resort to the question of, are there issues of primary jurisdiction or not, will simply breed more litigation, I suggest, in this area, and it is not a satisfactory test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.297" offset="7626698">In the rate area the Court has absolutely and clearly foreclosed state and common law remedies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2356.214" offset="9570313">We suggest, Your Honors, that the fault, or the problem with the petitioner's position in this case is simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.537" offset="9627678">It was pointed out by Justice Frankfurter in the case of Pan American Oil Company v. Superior Court about 20 years ago, and that is this, that a party who brings the suit is the master to decide what law he will rely upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.217" offset="9710329">And in the district court of Iowa, the Kalo Brick &amp; Tile Company relied upon three theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.071" offset="9757767">The first was failure to provide car service upon reasonable notice and within reasonable time, pursuant to Iowa Statute 479.3.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.536" offset="9799668">The second and the most important one to the issues here, is the fact that Kalo pled a cause of action based upon the negligence of the Railroad and its employees, a state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.764" offset="9864556">And that statute, I've pointed it out here and I don't like to take a lot of time reading, but it says,--</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.559" offset="9895694">"Every corporation operating a railroad shall be liable for all damages sustained by any person in the consequences of the acts of the agents. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.242" offset="9942505">There is also a third, kind of a throwaway issue and that is, interference with prospective business advantage or business relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.566" offset="9979704">Now, both the Railroad and the amicus before this Court have characterized this case as either, number one, a car service case, or number two, an abandonment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.105" offset="10049921">And they have conveniently for purposes which are obvious to this decision, have avoided discussing either in their briefs or in argument the question of the Iowa negligence statute, which is 479.122.</text>

            <text syncTime="2857.753" offset="11576517">Well, that again, Your Honor, is a nice statement but taken... it's in the case itself, it's stated somewhat hypothetically without reference to the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.650" offset="11640046">And we have no argument with the suggestion of the amicus or the Chicago North Western that the Interstate Commerce Commission does have exclusive jurisdiction over such things as rates, over such things as abandonments, over such things as rate discrimination, discrimination against the furnishing of cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.248" offset="11770450">But our approach is fairly narrow in that it arises basically under an Iowa negligence statute which has nothing to do with national transportation policy, which has nothing to do with the intercession of administrative expertise, and it has none of the rubric of your ordinary regulation-type case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.611" offset="11891971">The facts: basically, the Kalo Brick &amp; Tile Company which was a family business, been in business for almost a hundred years, had been served for 75 years by this same rail line, had been served very well until 1960 when the Chicago North Western took it over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.803" offset="11984654">During the '60s, not only did the track begin to fail, but Kalo was not getting the switches, Kalo was not getting adequate cars... they were getting bad cars, they were getting all sorts of poor service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.579" offset="12047766">They were promised better service but it never came.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.781" offset="12064589">And so, consequently, through that period of time they were led to believe that things will be better, but they never got better.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.481" offset="12095413">Now, the Court is obviously aware that the cause of the failure of the railroad was because of imponding water along the side of the tracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.680" offset="12140239">In April of '73 the track became impassable, and then in August.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.878" offset="12180990">Kalo because it required railroad transportation to be competitive in its business, sold its assets and went out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.593" offset="12219860">And it wasn't until three months after that, that finally the application for a certificate of convenience and necessity was filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.010" offset="12281509">Now, our point, going back again to the Iowa negligence statute, is this: that tort became, that state court tort action became complete on the day when the damage existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.172" offset="12362175">And I think that's general negligence law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.625" offset="12371998">So the negligence, and the damages, if any, were established in August, quite a bit of time prior to the time that the railroad made application for abandonment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3272.882" offset="13237069">It gives me no problem to this extent, that I think it creates a... let me analogize to another area of modern tort law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.235" offset="13294433">The emergence in the last 20 years or 25 years of products liability litigation has caused manufacturers to recognize their duties and their obligations to the consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.021" offset="13405611">Now, I don't think there are very many people except perhaps some manufacturers who would not say that that has a salutary and good effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.549" offset="13439674">And I think the same thing would happen in this kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.625" offset="13459945">The railroads in this case, I think, in this country, I think everyone would admit are in bad condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.076" offset="13493800">We've had a regulatory scheme since 1887 which has not cured those conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.572" offset="13527759">Now, we're simply saying that the state tort claim would put the presence on the railroads to make those decisions rather than to let the railroads fall by neglect and what we term abandonment by neglect.</text>

            <text syncTime="3372.155" offset="13634130">I'm simply saying that that's an analogy that the products liability cases have caused manufacturers to recognize their duties.</text>

            <label>Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="3381.307" offset="13670701">But those have been generated largely by state court fashioning of tort law remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.820" offset="13704765">Here we have congressional statutes that govern us and we aren't free to depart from them.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="m_gene_blackburn" startTime="3397.473" stopTime="4083.326">
            <label>Mr. M. Gene Blackburn</label>
            <text syncTime="3397.473" offset="13735380">Except, Your Honor, that we're saying that the way this case is pleaded it's not pleaded within those federal guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.969" offset="13777385">The case was pleaded as a state court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.998" offset="13801522">I think the best case in support of our theory, and it doesn't get to the question of primary jurisdiction or preemption, is the case of Johnson against Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul, out of the 9th Circuit, which is a diversity case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.836" offset="13868814">And the court reached some of these issues that we're talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.942" offset="13889294">In any event, Section 22 of the Act preserves to the states, preserves in clear and unqualified language, existing remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.405" offset="13955122">And states, the remedies provided for in this subtitle are in addition to remedies existing under another law or at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.385" offset="13999008">And that is in the 1978 recodification to the Transportation Act, and it's significant to note that that section which is 101.03 was given its separate place, and it was taken out of a rate section, which was 22, which defined rates, and it was given special emphasis by giving it a special section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.934" offset="14129202">We also suggest, Your Honor, that the law as pronounced by this Court in the case cited by the petitioner, Jones v. Rath Packing Company, is that there is an assumption against preemption, particularly unless there is a clear and manifest purpose otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.692" offset="14212272">We suggest also that there is no conflict between state law remedies or any federal or regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.092" offset="14269846">One of the questions that was posed in opposing counsel's discussion I think can be answered in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.881" offset="14344974">Under Kalo's theory of negligent track maintenance and granted it's a narrow theory, there is no cause of action in federal court or before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.093" offset="14413833">We do not contend that there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.014" offset="14421565">There are no federal track maintenance standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.855" offset="14444866">The only way that Kalo could get into federal court would be, under this theory, would be via diversity action, which would call upon the district court to grant original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.597" offset="14527831">Any claim... and we concede... any claim that is made under the Act must be made through the Commission, and then referred to the federal court, or if it's brought in federal court, I would agree with the question that was previously asked that it probably must be referred to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.837" offset="14620827">But that overlooks our theory of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.835" offset="14640784">Our theory, the federal act, the federal Interstate Commerce Act, does not encompass negligent track maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.705" offset="14700344">Our theory is narrow but it's viable under the decisions of this Court, and we know of no case which overrules the Puritan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.073" offset="14769829">It's never been expressly overruled, and I think this Court has said on several occasions that it did not favor implied overruling of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.850" offset="14808909">But in any event our theory is based upon negligent track maintenance and there's nothing about that theory which imposes or incites a federal rule or a federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.419" offset="14895217">Now, one of the theories that the Railroad would have us follow is, if you're is, harmed, you seek injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.867" offset="14944954">Well, Your Honors, in this case, injunction was not an adequate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.036" offset="14973584">It would be foolish for the Kalo people to spend their then inadequate resources to enjoin the abandonment of a railroad that had already failed, and for which they'd been told that it wasn't going to be rebuilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.995" offset="15057490">But the injunction theory, which they would have us follow, is a very narrow theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.914" offset="15105137">Under the 8th Circuit decisions which are cited in, I think, both briefs, the Interstate Commerce Commission v. the Chicago North Western, and the Interstate Commerce Commission v. Chicago, Rock Island, &amp; Pacific, the Chicago, Rock Island, &amp; Pacific case indicated that the only question before in that proceeding is whether or not there is an illegal abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.620" offset="15228017">Well, at that point of the proceedings, Kalo was out of business and had no incentive to proceed further by injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.037" offset="15273679">Likewise, those issues, of course, go to the question of the primary jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.299" offset="15302727">If the Interstate Commerce Commission had no primary jurisdiction... in other words, if this does not involve questions of national transportation policy, if it does not require the administrative expertise to solve this problem, if it is of a kind of problem that can be handled by the conventional wisdom of judges, then the ICC has no primary jurisdiction, unless it's found somewhere else within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.094" offset="15481823">And under our theory, once again, we'd say it's not found anywhere else in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.343" offset="15502825">So if there is no primary jurisdiction, there is no collateral estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.699" offset="15532291">And there are other reasons for denying collateral estoppel in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.666" offset="15552144">First, there are policy reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3854.509" offset="15563534">The issues are not the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.915" offset="15573147">The issue before the Commission was limited to one thing: was the Railroad entitled to a certificate of convenience and necessity which would permit it to abandon the line?</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.017" offset="15633542">The issues before the state court were negligence, car service issues, and with the defense that the failure of the road was an act of God, which I think is rather interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.168" offset="15690175">Because under Iowa law and under law generally, and this is also cited in the 9th Circuit case of Johnson v. Chicago, Milwaukee, in order for a defense in a civil suit, the extents of acts of God in a civil suit to be a defense, it must be the sole proximate cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.113" offset="15769901">Now, Kalo... another reason for denying collateral estoppel in this case before the Interstate Commerce Commission is this: Kalo had no incentive to go to Washington to be involved in those proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.025" offset="15869584">It was out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.229" offset="15878362">This Court also announced the Fairness Doctrine in the Parklane Hosiery case, and we call your specific attention to Note 15 of that case, which sets forth the fact that it may often times be unfair to call a party out of and come to a foreign forum to litigate issues which are beyond the reach of its own discovery procedures and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.574" offset="16011795">I also call the Court's attention to the general rule of the restatement of judgments which is now in a tentative draft fourth edition, which says, in the case of a judgment entered without contest by concession, consent, or default, none of the issues is actually litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.001" offset="16109493">"Therefore the rule of this section does not apply with respect to any issue in a subsequent action. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.453" offset="16139273">Finally, Your Honors, with regard to the question of collateral estoppel or res judicata or issue preclusion, we suggest that... and writers have suggested that there is a general fear that overuse of issue preclusion will cause litigants to overtry their cases and therefore you get a reverse-adverse effect, because the reason for the collateral estoppel rule in the first place is to preserve the judicial economy and not extend it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.496" offset="16327459">Also, Your Honors, I would suggest that collateral estoppel should never be used as a trap for the unwary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.023" offset="16373539">Once again, Your Honors, we would suggest that an affirmance of the Iowa Court of Appeals would provide a check against abandonment by neglect, and a balancing process between the regulated, the regulator, and the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.438" offset="16447204">We thank you very much, Your Honors, and it's been an honor to be here.</text>

            <text syncTime="4092.041" offset="16513660">I'd just like to call the Court's attention to the Puritan case cited by the respondent, wherein the Court in Puritan says that the Congress evidenced its intent to make the Commerce Commission and the federal district court the exclusive forums for Section 9 damage action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4112.891" offset="16597042">And their reason for that is that after Section 9 was enacted by Congress, it enacted the Carmack amendment on freight loss and damage claims, which specifically gave actions in state or federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4124.434" offset="16643227">Secondly, that the Johnson case, the 9th Circuit case cited by respondent in his argument as his foremost case, specifically states that it is deciding the case under federal law and declined to apply state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.882" offset="16704980">And that case was tried in a federal district court.</text>
