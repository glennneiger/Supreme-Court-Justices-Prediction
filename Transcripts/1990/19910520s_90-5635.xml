            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73961">The second case I have to announce is McCarthy against Bronson.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.480" offset="95799">The petitioner in this case is a prisoner who brought suit against various state prison officials alleging that they violated his constitutional rights by using excessive force when transferring him from one cell to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.135" offset="150448">Over petitionerâ€™s objection, the case was referred to a magistrate to conduct an evidentiary hearing and prepare proposed findings effect and conclusions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.175" offset="190572">A federal statute authorizes the nonconsensual referral to a magistrate of prisoner petitions challenging conditions of confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.398" offset="231532">Thus, the question is whether an allegation of a single episode of unconstitutional conduct by prison officials is covered by that language, or whether the language instead includes only challenges to ongoing prison conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.933" offset="289628">The District Court and the Court of Appeals both held that both types of cases may be referred to a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.078" offset="314183">In a unanimous opinion filed with the Clerk today, we agree with that interpretation of the statute and thus, affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
