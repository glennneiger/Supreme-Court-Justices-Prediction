            <text syncTime="6.033" offset="97992">In the first of these two cases, Lankford against Idaho, we granted certiorari to review a judgment of the Idaho Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.398" offset="135503">That court, by a vote of three-to-two, upheld a death sentence imposed on petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.465" offset="159745">He had been tried by a jury and convicted of first degree murder, a capital offense under Idaho law.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.776" offset="185032">His sentencing hearing was conducted by the trial judge some eight months after the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.311" offset="207183">Several weeks in advance of the sentencing hearing, at petitioner's request, the trial judge entered an order requiring the state to notify the court and the petitioner whether it would seek the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.186" offset="258697">The state filed a formal response saying that it would not recommend the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.037" offset="282103">Although petitioner had been advised at his arraignment that if convicted he would be eligible for the death penalty under Idaho law.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.170" offset="310628">At the sentencing hearing, petitioner's counsel presumably in reliance of the state's response to the Trial Court's order, made no argument whatsoever concerning the permissibility or appropriateness of a capital sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.050" offset="366112">Both the prosecutor and the defense merely debated the length of an appropriate sentence of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.710" offset="392757">Several days later, the judge reconvened petitioner's sentencing hearing, read his written findings, and sentenced him to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.042" offset="422119">The question that we decide today is whether at the time of the sentencing hearing petitioner and his counsel had adequate notice that the judge might sentence him to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.628" offset="464437">The unique history of this case, which is spelled out at some length in our opinion, persuades us that the notice was not adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.486" offset="495889">The pre-sentencing order entered by the Trial Court requiring the state to advise the court and petitioner whether it sought the death penalty was somewhat comparable to a pre-trial order limiting the issues to be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.673" offset="544581">The purpose of such order is to eliminate the need to address matters that are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.159" offset="566524">Defense counsel reasonably assumed that she should not present argument or evidence directed at the question whether the death penalty was either appropriate or permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.324" offset="607170">If defense counsel had been notified that the trial judge was contemplating a death sentence, there are legal and factual arguments that she presumably would have made but did not make because she reasonably assumed that the only issue concerning the length of petitioner's incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.758" offset="676970">The trial judge's silence, following the state's response to the pre-sentencing order, had the practical effect of concealing from the parties the principal issue to be decided at the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.907" offset="721587">The lack of adequate notice that the judge was contemplating the death penalty created an impermissible risk that the adversary process may have malfunctioned in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.778" offset="760979">Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.645" offset="776444">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice, Justice White, and Justice Souter have joined.</text>
