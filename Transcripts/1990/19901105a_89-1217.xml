            <label>Mr. Raymond J. LaJeunesse, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="35.994" offset="274757">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="39.597" offset="289177">Professor Jim Lehnert and his fellow petitioners in 1981-82 were nonunion faculty members at Ferris State College, a 4-year institution of higher education in the State of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.567" offset="341108">They were compelled by the college to pay as a condition of their employment a service fee to their exclusive bargaining representative, the Ferris Faculty Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.884" offset="378411">The lower courts, with Justice Merritt of the court of appeals vigorously dissenting as to all but one activity, held that Professor Lehnert and his colleagues' First Amendment rights were not violated when those service fees were used for certain activities of the association and at State and national affiliates, the Michigan and National Education Associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.790" offset="481961">Two basic questions are before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.152" offset="495440">First, may Professor Lehnert and his colleagues be required to subsidize financially activities which are not conducted on behalf of their bargaining unit but on behalf of individuals elsewhere in other bargaining units in Michigan and in other States, on behalf of employees who are not faculty members in higher education but teachers in kindergarten through 12th grade, educational support personnel, or nurses.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.721" offset="613722">The second major issue is whether Professor Lehnert and his nonunion colleagues can be required to support financially political and ideological activities that are not part of the bargaining process anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.340" offset="664191">What activities are we talking about?</text>
            <text syncTime="135.782" offset="673908">Most of the activities at issue on this appeal both do not concern the Ferris bargaining unit and are not integral to the bargaining process anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.430" offset="724586">For example, two of the primary expenditures at issue are the costs of millage campaigns to increase millage property taxes and lobbying against State legislation that would have provided property tax relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.590" offset="789161">Ferris State College receives not one cent from millages or from property taxes, so therefore, Ferris State College was not affected by these activities at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.307" offset="836077">The only effect on Professor Lehnert and his colleagues was as competitors for scarce public resources, and if they lived in the district where the taxes were raised, their taxes went up.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.946" offset="886650">They're affected as taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.017" offset="890934">Another example of an issue or an activity in this category was the study that the National Education Association conducted of school finance in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.655" offset="929491">That had to be a political and ideological activity and it wasn't related to Ferris State College because Arizona did not even permit collective bargaining for educational employees at the time in question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1561.557" offset="6377066">To help establish a context I would like to begin by very briefly commenting about the nature of the three unions that are involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.450" offset="6408622">The first... and to clarify my acronyms also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.662" offset="6421474">The Ferris Faculty Association, FFA, is the bargaining representative for a unit of 500 faculty members at the college.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.598" offset="6457210">It is a small local union which in the year in question, 1981 and '82, had a budget of some $18,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.886" offset="6490333">FFA is affiliated with two much larger unions with substantially greater and more diverse resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.891" offset="6522411">At the State level it's affiliated with the Michigan Education Association, MEA, which in that year had a budget in excess of $18 million; and at the national level, it's affiliated with the National Educational Association, the NEA, which had resources in excess of $70 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.781" offset="6597957">The courts below held that the petitioners may be charged for the course of certain activities engaged in by MEA and NEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.938" offset="6634529">Because these activities did not directly involve the collective bargaining process at Ferris State College, petitioners contend that they are in effect being asked to subsidize employees in other bargaining units represented by MEA and NEA to pay for services provided to these other employees which is of no benefit to the members in their own bargaining unit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1711.490" offset="6976733">It's in the essence of affiliation, Your Honor, in three respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.444" offset="6992615">One, the contract of affiliation is indeed a contract between parent organizations and locals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.030" offset="7022917">The guidelines and the policies of the parent organizations, many of which are in the record in this case, obligate the parent organization to provide assistance to the local in a variety of collective bargaining-related areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.189" offset="7075580">And the most important enforcement mechanism here is political reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.834" offset="7094179">If a parent organization failed to respond to one of our locals when it needed us in a collective bargaining crisis, we would not be the parent organization as soon as that crisis ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.682" offset="7141513">So we must indeed respond, and I think the answer to your question is, yes, it is built into the very nature of the affiliation relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="1782.364" offset="7260318">What this Court stated in Abood was that the designation of a union as an exclusive representative carries with it great responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.212" offset="7299711">It referred to the difficult and continuing tasks and indicated that to carry out these functions a bargaining representative needs the service of lawyers, expert negotiators, economists, a research staff, as well as general administrative personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.053" offset="7367002">What has happened here is by selecting as a bargaining representative a local union that was affiliated with larger parent organizations, the majority of employees in the Ferris College bargaining unit have chosen to provide and fund certain of those responsibilities on a unit... a cross unit basis with a sharing of the risks in which all of the people who benefit, the members and the feepayers, are charged a periodic uniform flat fee.</text>

            <text syncTime="1936.223" offset="7875763">The lower courts held we only could get 3 percent and made it perfectly clear that it was quite likely we put in substantially more in terms of chargeable activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.012" offset="7922888">The court's position was we blew it on the proofs, on evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1953.146" offset="7943368">The theory that you espouse, why don't we charge them 100 percent, breaks down for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.043" offset="7975028">The vast bulk of the affiliation fee is for this availability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.977" offset="7998748">That's what it's mostly for, but we all know that is not the total of the affiliation fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.003" offset="8022885">In addition, a small portion of the affiliation fee pays for member-only benefits that the parent organizations provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.796" offset="8057993">It does pay for some ideological or political activity that is unrelated to collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.031" offset="8082966">If we charge the feepayers the full amount of the fee, they would be paying a disproportionate percentage for the availability component as compared to the members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.270" offset="8127897">So what we need in essence is a pricing mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.851" offset="8142212">We need a discounting mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.724" offset="8149735">How do we take that affiliation fee to the parents and kick out that small portion that isn't for availability?</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.618" offset="8181291">There is in fact no perfect way to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.910" offset="8194457">What we have in essence done is taken the guidance that this Court has given us in a slightly different context of how you analyze out a union's budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.067" offset="8235104">And what we have said about the parent organizations is we will discount out those things that we really can charge for by looking at what activities are germane to collective bargaining in the generic sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.726" offset="8289752">In a conceptual way, Your Honor, what we say is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.259" offset="8303858">Those parent organizations constitute a pool of resources, a pool that this local or any other local can draw on in times of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.417" offset="8344504">And what we do is we say, in a generic way, what types of resources, what types of skills, what types of activities, fit within that resource pool, and that's why we make that kind of a deduction from the affiliation fee.</text>

            <text syncTime="2104.340" offset="8548155">That was a statutory holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.621" offset="8557350">The Court began by analyzing what of the activities in question were chargeable under the Railway Labor Act, and only as to those activities that it found met the standard under the Railway Labor Act did it address directly the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.772" offset="8617954">The litigation never crossed that bridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.184" offset="8631538">So what we have with litigation then is basically a statutory holding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2137.614" offset="8681275">And I have no question but that Ellis in many respects sets the basic test for First Amendment adjudication and indeed this Court recognized this last term in Keller when it applied it to a constitutional base.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.893" offset="8734356">But in Ellis itself, as far as not the test, but the application of that test to specific items, the Court only applied the constitutional test to those items it had found chargeable under the RLA and litigation of a general nature did not make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.446" offset="8800602">But having answered it that way and attempted to distinguish Ellis my answer to your question is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.849" offset="8822232">Under... first of all, I believe litigation may have a different meaning in the public sector in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.614" offset="8849295">But under our theory in which you are paying for the availability of this service, I do believe the litigation would be brought in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.700" offset="8881582">Because it's not relevant whether the specific activity in the resource pool of the parent organizations is done on behalf of Ferris.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.277" offset="8919930">It is whether it is an activity in the generic sense that is germane to collective bargaining.</text>

            <text syncTime="2218.373" offset="9004357">But let me look at the other points of Ellis if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.596" offset="9013239">What Ellis did, and I think the focus when we look at Ellis should be on the three items that the Court did indeed find chargeable under the Railway Labor Act and clearly within the constitutional range as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.983" offset="9066738">And there are three activities there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.124" offset="9075306">One was a national convention, that is, a convention that dealt with all of the bargaining units represented by BRAC, not simply Western Airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.801" offset="9114072">It allowed social activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.623" offset="9125357">These were not social activities that took place in San Diego, wherever Western Airlines is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.307" offset="9148031">These were social activities of the international union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.669" offset="9161510">And it allowed chargeable... as chargeable the national publication which reported on a variety of activities engaged in by the International, many or indeed most of which had nothing whatsoever to do with the Western Airlines bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.490" offset="9224831">Now in the briefing, the petitioners attempt to distinguish that publication point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.955" offset="9250640">What they say is the literal language of Ellis was you can only charge... you can only charge for writing up what you can charge for doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.630" offset="9289301">And therefore, to say they sustained a national publication doesn't make our point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.833" offset="9306124">But it does, if you read the holding in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.697" offset="9317618">Of course, at the very point where the Court in Ellis said you can only charge for what you have in that publication that you can actually charge for doing, it dropped a footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.882" offset="9358369">And the footnote was, and therefore, you cannot charge for the litigation and the organizing, both of which it took out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.457" offset="9392642">And the holding in the case was to remand to the lower court simply to excise out of chargeability to two activities it had incorrectly held chargeable under the RLA: organizing and general litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.449" offset="9448648">The Petitioners contend in this case that this multi-unit cost-sharing system violates their First Amendment rights, and that they can only be required to pay their share of the actual services delivered by the parent organizations to them on a pay-as-you-go basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.811" offset="9530046">Whatever we have... may have put in in a particular year in dealing with their employer is all that they can pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.547" offset="9557004">Let me make clear here what the legal issue is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.039" offset="9571006">The issue is not whether the type of pay-as-you-go delivery system that the petitioners urge is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.266" offset="9607891">The question is rather whether the Constitution requires every bargaining unit to use that system or whether the State of Michigan can constitutionally conclude that it would like to reject that system and that a cross unit, a risk-sharing type of system as we have here fulfills or advances the State's interest in labor peace and stability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.184" offset="9723561">We think that if you look at the purpose of affiliation, the answer to this question is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.549" offset="9756997">The aggregated payments that MEA and NEA get are not used simply to defray the actual cost of providing services to the Ferris local or to other locals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.747" offset="9805794">They are used to establish and maintain the type of institution with an expert staff of lawyers, of negotiators, and of researchers that is available when called upon by Ferris or any other local to provide these services on an as-needed basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.639" offset="9885415">Now, if in fact the petitioners simply paid for the services that they received in a particular year, they would really be freeloading or free riding on two specific values of affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.103" offset="9955215">They would be not contributing to the costs incurred by a parent union in assembling and maintaining the type of institution that is necessary to be available when called upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.911" offset="10018431">And indeed the mere fact that it has large affiliates and that it has resources to call upon is itself of present value to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.970" offset="10066705">It affects its day-to-day operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.312" offset="10080080">We don't have to squirrel away money as a reserve fund for the year in which we may have catastrophic costs, a year we bargain a contract, a year we have major arbitrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.441" offset="10128563">We can do our day-to-day services knowing we have that to call on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.564" offset="10145073">And the fact that we have that to call on has an impact on the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.777" offset="10165971">Any prudent employer, knowing we are backed by the MEA and the NEA, will take that into account in its dealing with the local union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.284" offset="10211946">We are aware, Your Honors, of no First Amendment principle which would require the State of Michigan to adopt a unit-by-unit pay-as-you-go-system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.423" offset="10268475">We think it is a reasonable and constitutionally allowable judgment for the State of Michigan to conclude that a cross unit risk-sharing system of providing services through affiliation is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.903" offset="10326467">And I would note to you that every other legislature which has looked at this question has made the same judgment, and that is why the overwhelming majority of employees and the overwhelming majority of bargaining units in this country have chosen to carry out their representational functions by an affiliation arrangement where they operate on a multi-unit cost basis and share the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.630" offset="10433360">Let me turn now, if I may, to the second issue presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.914" offset="10450496">The specific activities that the court below charged the petitioners for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.087" offset="10471185">Because this Court indicated that an agency shop has an impact on the First Amendment rights of objecting feepayers, petitioners argue that they can only be required to pay for those activities that are essential or necessary to the union's performance of its statutory functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.500" offset="10548821">Phrased otherwise, we can only charge them for things that the local union must do pursuant to a statutory obligation or its duty of fair representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.038" offset="10590931">But that argument, Your Honors, is squarely at odds with the position taken by this Court in Abood, in Ellis, and in Keller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.874" offset="10626353">As those cases make abundantly clear, the test is not essential or necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.049" offset="10651012">The test is as Justice White asked in the question, is it germane?</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.200" offset="10667626">Is it reasonably related to the function of the bargaining representative in collective bargaining?</text>

            <text syncTime="2841.431" offset="11496544">In Abood, this Court referred to some of the unique characteristics of public sector bargaining, and it stated in Abood that the bargaining representative is the public employer who sit at the table are not free agents economically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.961" offset="11562686">It pointed out that they cannot make commitments and carry them out.</text>

            <text syncTime="2876.413" offset="11636455">Now the Court was not saying that simply as a unique characteristic of public sector bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.547" offset="11661011">It was saying that that is a factor that determines whether we will do what we're supposed to do in bargaining, whether we will achieve for the people we represent salaries and economic improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.287" offset="11707926">If in fact the people who sit at the table cannot make those decisions without budgets, without money, without millage, we must participate in those activities to effectively carry out our job.</text>

            <text syncTime="2994.527" offset="12108958">I know that in a year where I have very high bargaining costs, a year I negotiate a contract, a year I have major arbitrations, I can call on those parent organizations to help me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.882" offset="12158382">In order to be there when I need them, those parent organizations must maintain themselves as an institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.669" offset="12189520">They must have a staff of lawyers, of negotiators, of research people, of whatever I need, they must have that staff and those resources available to provide to me.</text>

            <text syncTime="3044.947" offset="12310624">So we have to come up with a pricing mechanism.</text>

            <text syncTime="3057.426" offset="12360570">So I look at the budgets of the parent organization.</text>

            <text syncTime="3062.770" offset="12381886">I will certainly take out member-only benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.823" offset="12398082">I will take out that portion of the parent organization budget that goes to political and ideological activity that has no relation to collective bargaining in the generic sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.929" offset="12442490">But as I try to construct a pool of resources, I say that what I will keep in are all of the resources that go from those parent organizations to do the kinds of things that would be germane to collective bargaining if done in any kind of a bargaining unit, if done in Ferris.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.563" offset="12521066">And they are.</text>
