            <text syncTime="520.001" offset="2206473">In the whole process of the merit trial there was one sanction imposed, and that was a contempt sanction for violation of an order of court imposed on the client.</text>

            <text syncTime="533.820" offset="2261748">The Fifth Circuit said that they would hold double cost and attorneys' fees as sanctions for the frivolous appeal, and it remanded to the district court saying would you look for casting costs or attorneys' fees under Rule 11, on the client and attorneys are under 28 U.S.C. 1927 for the attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.839" offset="2373761">And when it went back to the district court... before we got to that there was a motion to indicate some of the extent of damages in this case which are not really permitted except for economic, there was a motion for assistance before we got to the... to this motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.424" offset="2456099">And the district court in that motion for assistance ordered $2 million worth of assets, equipment that had been added to the television station since the list was made up for what would be transferred, to also be transferred for the same consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.723" offset="2517330">Then NASCO, the respondent, urged the court to reject Rule 11 and reject 28 1927, and to go to the inherent power.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.503" offset="2576471">And that court said we find and agree with the parties to this sanctioning proceeding... that's NASCO... that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 does not furnish a basis for the consideration of the sanctionable acts alleged by NASCO.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.493" offset="2640419">We find that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 for the levying of sanctions at this time, at the time of the appellate court's decree on August 6th, 1986, and at the time of the acts themselves were committed, to be insufficient for our purposes here.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.083" offset="2710741">So what happened is you have them rejecting any conduct that could be sanctioned under 11, and none was sanctioned under 11 during the proceedings, and none was sanctioned under 1927 during the proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1497.000" offset="6114496">And then finally, it wasn't necessarily a fee shifting statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.893" offset="6130065">It wasn't, because it had no... movant had no entitlement to fees or other sanction, explained in Cooter v. Gell in citing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.039" offset="6170607">Then, what I understand, Justice Kennedy, is that any mechanism for redistributing cost, even the inherent sanctioning authority of the Federal court has the potential to affect decisions concerning whether and where to file suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1538.697" offset="6281261">Whether you can do it under the Enabling Act, I have my problems, but I don't have to address that because we have no rules here.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joel I. Klein</label>
            <text syncTime="1702.165" offset="6935159">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.780" offset="6953549">The question in this case is whether petitioner was improperly sanctioned for his bad faith litigation conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.453" offset="6976223">We submit that he wasn't, based on the following analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.966" offset="6990329">First, the authority to impose attorneys' fees for abusing the court's processes is clearly on of the several inherent sanctioning powers that Federal courts possess, in this Court's words, for the specific purpose of managing their affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.687" offset="7073190">Second, that kind of sanctioning power, by definition, protects core judicial process concerns, and therefore applies in diversity cases just as it applies in all other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.637" offset="7125017">And third, the district court didn't abuse its discretion in this case in setting the amount of petitioner's sanction to reflect the full cost of respondent's attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.265" offset="7171515">That determination properly rested on the factual finding that petitioner's entire litigation effort was designed to obstruct, impede, and indeed prevent judicial resolution of respondent's claim in the belief that through fraud, delay, harassment, and increasing legal fees, respondent would abandon its claim.</text>

            <label>Justice Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="1783.590" offset="7260853">At some point during your argument, Mr. Klein, perhaps we could discuss or you could tell me why the district court couldn't have done all of this, or substantially all of it, under Rule 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.708" offset="7313307">I am very troubled by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.678" offset="7321144">It seems to me that Rule 11 classically covers this conduct.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joel I. Klein</label>
            <text syncTime="1803.092" offset="7338803">Well, Your Honor, I think there are two points that I'd like to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.655" offset="7353118">First of all, I would agree with the point you made before, that is if this conduct was all sanctionable under Rule 11 and the district court simply invoked the wrong rule, then I think the case ought to be affirmed on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.572" offset="7400765">I will suggest to you why I think the court thought that he could not, and that is I think there has been some dispute among the circuits about just how far Rule 11 applies in terms of signings and parties, also in terms of, for example, in this case there was a fabrication of a fraud, as you pointed out ahead of... in the other argument, there is a fabrication of a fraud designed to mislead and abuse the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.042" offset="7518630">Now, in that situation a lot of events occurred that were in some respects reflective of a pleading, but not necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.156" offset="7551021">And so I think the court was simply being cautious, given the fact that the circuits have had a more limited view of Rule 11, and I would suggest the majority did suggest yesterday that Rule 11 had a kind of discrete power analysis rather than a generic.</text>

            <text syncTime="1900.696" offset="7729281">However, I don't want to be in a position of suggesting that something close to this award isn't sustainable on Rule 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.951" offset="7762300">I think the court was right in putting it on the power that he did have, and I think... and I think that you're right, Mr. Chief Justice, in pointing out that I think this Court and certainly the circuit courts have taken a more limited view of what Rule 11 is addressed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.790" offset="7821650">After all, it's only one of several sanctions in the course of the entire rules directed at a particular phase in the proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1937.140" offset="7875044">There is also the problem that, as I read Rule 11, there has to be some assessment of how much harm the particular filing caused to the other side, and the award here was all the attorneys' fees, wasn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="2098.264" offset="8519537">Every bit of it was to frustrate and thwart the court's effort at doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.197" offset="8539286">He litigated for 3 years over a series of counterclaims and affirmative defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.720" offset="8561333">On the eve of trial, voluntarily, after this whole process, he stipulates that the contract was valid, that he had no defense to the contract, and that we had not violated the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.849" offset="8609817">That, I think, is the essential finding, and I think that's the basis that this Court should affirm on.</text>

            <text syncTime="2164.910" offset="8786091">Well, Mr. Klein, I think perhaps you ought to, because I think Justice Scalia's question to you was why doesn't Rule 11 limit inherent power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.765" offset="8829559">My question to you is take a look at Section 1920... 1927.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.598" offset="8848889">In June of 1980 this Court decided in Roadway that 1927 did not extend to the imposition of attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.674" offset="8885147">In September of 1980 Congress comes along and says... and amends 1927, and says yes, it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.688" offset="8909180">Now, was that just brutum fulmen on the part of Congress?</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.542" offset="8924644">I mean, could Congress... could the Court have done whatever it wanted under inherent powers anyway?</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.522" offset="8940527">I think inherent powers may disappear as Congress steps in, or as the rules committee--</text>

            <label>Mr. Joel I. Klein</label>
            <text syncTime="2210.027" offset="8966545">--Let me answer it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.077" offset="8974799">First of all, there were two aspects to Roadway, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.109" offset="8986920">The initial aspect was the inherent sanctioning power against parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.715" offset="9009281">That was what the Court built upon to extend to attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.877" offset="9025999">Now, that... then, subsequent to that, this Court, Congress, as you point out, amended 1927 to cover parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.352" offset="9059854">And I would say, quite frankly, that 1927, as I read it, is coextensive with the Roadway power that was applied to attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.807" offset="9093709">However, this other power in Roadway, which I think traces back much earlier, for example to Chief Justice Taft's opinion in Toledo Scale, that power Congress has never touched.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.995" offset="9134460">It has not amended, it has not changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.196" offset="9143237">Second, the Court is also clear in Link v. Wabash, Justice Harlan's opinion, he says when Congress or the rulemakers want to limit or eliminate an inherent power, one that this Court has recognized, it has to speak with unmistakable clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.138" offset="9215021">Now, Congress, certainly in passing 1927, never suggested, never suggested that it was attempting to divest the Federal courts of their ability to sanction parties; 1927 is purely attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.228" offset="9267371">And second of all, the rulemakers, when they amended Rule 11 in 1983, flat out said they were, quote, "building on and expanding" the... inherent power recognized in Roadway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.105" offset="9314914">So it seems to me--</text>

            <text syncTime="2305.049" offset="9346679">What the rulemakers did in 1983, Mr. Chief Justice, is that they said under the inherent power you need to have a showing of bad faith, subjective bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.537" offset="9392550">We are now imposing a higher standard on counsel, and as the Court has found, on parties to require more of an objective.</text>

            <text syncTime="2335.460" offset="9468305">Well, the inherent power, I think, was a more limited one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.091" offset="9478858">It was for, frankly, I think, the concerns that were articulated in the opinion yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.755" offset="9501428">That is, that the inherent power was saying if you act in bad faith, you intentionally misuse the processes of this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.741" offset="9537372">The court needs that power to defend itself, to protect its integrity and to protect its processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.854" offset="9557852">That is the scope of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.336" offset="9563808">That was what was applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.376" offset="9571959">Now, I think that's unequivocal in Roadway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.160" offset="9587110">I mean, I think what Roadway says, and it seems to me this is the key to the holding, that there are inherent powers governed not by rule or statute, but by the control necessarily, necessarily vested in courts to manage their affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.227" offset="9639355">And it seems to me if that's the power we're talking about, then it must be clear... it must be clear it applies in diversity cases just as it does in all other Federal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.054" offset="9686688">For example, the conduct that was condemned in Roadway itself, those abuses, is it conceivable that the Court would have said that they were not sanctionable in a case that was based on 1332 rather than 1331?</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.715" offset="9745307">That's not at all possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.948" offset="9754189">And let me suggest when we're dealing with, as I think Justice Marshall pointed out before, we're dealing with the court running its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.742" offset="9785431">That is such a core concern that it seems to me, even if a State thinks that a different set of powers is appropriate in its court, that you don't need this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.389" offset="9832034">If the Federal courts have made that determination, the State has no legitimate interest, cognizable under Erie or any other doctrine, that would divest the Federal courts of that power, just as it has no interest that would allow them to take away the full measure of contempt power, even if they insisted different contempt proceedings were held in their courts, or the power recognized in Link v. Wabash to dismiss a case sui sponte, even if they had a different view in their courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.257" offset="9939449">Now, I think to some degree, I just want to point out a couple of other quick points here, but I think petitioner is confusing a variety of different powers, and I will be the first to concede that Federal courts have lots of powers that are not clearly defined either by statute or by the Constitution, for example, the power to invoke an injunction or deny an injunction in an equitable case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.263" offset="10035475">And I admit, each of those powers presents its own individual Erie question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.135" offset="10055015">But I would suggest that while some of those powers raise complex Erie questions, a power that this Court has found as a fundamental sanctioning power to control the processes presents a very simple Erie question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.925" offset="10118127">And as I think Justice O'Connor has amply pointed out, I don't think anything in Alyeska was intended to detract from that point whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.860" offset="10149892">Petitioner's reliance on Alyeska, it seems to me, confuses two very different bases of authority for directing a party to pay fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.876" offset="10185941">One is to impose sanctions on an abusive... litigant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.869" offset="10205898">That's the power at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.801" offset="10217601">Now there is another power, and that is a power to shift fees to a prevailing party, having nothing to do with whether that party abused the process or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.880" offset="10262009">And that power has substantitive impact in the following ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.821" offset="10277683">It either is designed to bring, encourage bringing certain title litigation, or frankly, it may be designed to discourage certain kind of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.007" offset="10314463">That kind of power, we acknowledge, is probably substantitive under Erie, and that's the kind of power, by citing the Sioux City case in this footnote, that the Court had in mind in Alyeska.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.317" offset="10367753">Alyeska itself had nothing to do with judicial sanctioning powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.621" offset="10388964">Alyeska was concerned, pure and simple, with basic prevailing party situations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2598.592" offset="10520830">As I read the district court opinion, part of... part of what they say, it's page 51 of the appendix, Chambers and Gray...

            <text syncTime="2984.684" offset="12065190">The whole time he is doing depositions, he takes depositions of people in Boston about whether we could finance the deal or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3236.468" offset="13072367">The question here is whether he had the power, the inherent power.</text>

            <text syncTime="3254.240" offset="13143420">--The question is very broadly presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.721" offset="13157317">I wouldn't say the Court was barred from reaching the question, based on the question that is presented, but I think it's clear Rule 11 doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.055" offset="13178633">And the reason I think it's clear is because the rule itself expressly states it's expanding and building upon, and no way contracting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.091" offset="13210816">And it seems to me at worst the two powers are coextensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.805" offset="13233699">And if they are, the district court and the court of appeals acted entirely properly in placing it on the inherent power rather than Rule 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.972" offset="13270375">If the two powers are not coextensive, then it seems to me that the inherent power, being broader, is necessary in the sense that this Court found it necessary in Roadway.</text>

            <text syncTime="3303.673" offset="13341115">In regard to the rules, not only Rule 11, 11, 16(f), 26(g), 30(g)(1) and (2), 37(a), 37(b), 37(b)(1) and (2), 37(c), on and on are rules that govern conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.842" offset="13405794">And in this case the rules were, by the Fifth Circuit, said not to have anything to do with inherent power.</text>

            <text syncTime="3331.990" offset="13454381">Let them sit back and let them amass attorneys' fees and waste the court's time, then hit him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.774" offset="13473503">Hit him with inherent power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.895" offset="13482071">And that's just not the way the game should be played in this Court, not the way the rules envision it, not the way this Court envisions it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.559" offset="13512687">Moreover, there is not one fact in the entire record that Chambers designed a fraud upon the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.286" offset="13543616">It's a conclusion that he participated in everything and in the design, but the only fact is his statement that I didn't want to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.410" offset="13580083">I thought it was in the best interest of the public and me not to go through with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.582" offset="13592726">I was willing to pay damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.054" offset="13598682">I asked lawyers, can I pay damages and not sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.217" offset="13611325">The lawyers said yes, and they devised the plan, and I questioned the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.649" offset="13625013">I thought it might be a legal trick, but they persuaded me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.382" offset="13639955">And must have persuaded him pretty good because he kept running his business at the tune of an extra $2 million investment over the time of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.956" offset="13670257">The other thing is they wait 3 years to even bring their motion for sanctions after the court of appeals said do it.</text>
