            <text syncTime="52.487" offset="348955">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="55.389" offset="360553">This case involves the question whether, in a capital case, involving pervasive, prejudicial pretrial publicity, which a majority of the potential jurors have been exposed to, may a trial judge prohibit any inquiry whatsoever regarding what the jurors know.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.088" offset="427322">In answering that question, the pertinent facts in Mr. Mu'Min's case need to be briefly reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.171" offset="447698">He was charged in the fall of 1988 with capital murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.653" offset="461595">At that time he was serving a 48-year sentence for murder in the Virginia Department of Corrections.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.766" offset="482075">The case drew substantial press attention due to the nature of the crime and its unusual historical context.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.321" offset="508302">The articles, as the dissenting justices of the Virginia Supreme Court noted, were very negative in their tone and their content.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.287" offset="536096">They included reports that Mr. Mu'Min had confessed to the murder; that a rape was involved in this crime; the details of his 1973 murder conviction, including the fact that the death penalty was not an available punishment due to this Court's decision in Furman; Mr. Mu'Min's juvenile, criminal, prison and parole records as well as a number of other bad acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.480" offset="620942">Furthermore, this case became part of the then national debate about the laxity of the correction system.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.555" offset="645184">There were articles which indicated that all public officials associated with this crime should be fired as well as stories comparing Mr. Mu'Min's offense to a crime committed by the then infamous Willy Horton, and other crimes committed by Virginia prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.444" offset="704743">This case became caught up in the themes of the Bush/Dukakis presidential campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.086" offset="723342">Politicians, candidates, and public officials, including the prosecutor in this case, used it as an example of all that was wrong with the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.763" offset="762003">Then Governor Baliles suspended the work release program with great media fanfare as a result of this offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.036" offset="791156">The then Virginia Department of Transportation Secretary, Vivian Watt, made a public apology to the victim's family and to the citizens of the county as a result of this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.364" offset="828459">As a result of this media coverage, counsel requested that certain voir dire questions be asked regarding the content of the information that the potential jurors had been exposed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.922" offset="870673">The trial judge, however, refused to ask or permit any questions to this effect and only allowed several short questions regarding whether, in spite of the media accounts, the jurors could be impartial.</text>

            <text syncTime="558.978" offset="2374908">However, I think if the Sixth Amendment right to a fair and impartial jury is to mean anything, it must mean that when the publicity, taken as a whole, poses a constitutionally significant risk that the jurors may have been influenced by prejudicial, extraneous information, may have formed an opinion about the case, or be otherwise biased or partial as to guilt, or in a capital case, as to either guilt or the appropriate punishment, and one or more jurors have been exposed to that information, then some reasonable inquiry must be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.248" offset="2496011">I think more concretely in a case such as Mr. Mu'Min's where the publicity contains information which is inadmissible or inaccurate, which is material, and which is likely to mislead or inflame the jury as to guilt or punishment, some inquiry must be permitted as to what the jurors know.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.150" offset="2559541">Again, this is a more modest rule than what has already been adopted by this Court in Irvin, which is that sometimes jurors' assertions of impartiality must be disbelieved.</text>

            <text syncTime="629.126" offset="2655463">This Court has also acknowledged that a defendant's protection against that infringement... his protection against the effects of negative pretrial publicity is his ability to demonstrate actual juror bias.</text>

            <text syncTime="1353.274" offset="5552129">The bias that results from pretrial publicity is necessarily more fact specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.205" offset="5567802">It depends on what the media accounts say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.297" offset="5580132">And this Court has acknowledged that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3236.530" offset="13085112">Now, the assumption that is involved in Mu'Min's position that you can't trust what a juror says... if a juror says, I have no opinion about a case... is disproven by the kind of candor he shares--</text>

            <text syncTime="3255.654" offset="13161598">His position is that you can't assess it in fact, without knowing more than you... than this judge was willing to inquiry into.</text>

            <text syncTime="3263.571" offset="13193259">--Your Honor, our position is that jurors... I think the law is well established... is that jurors are presumed to be impartial and it is incumbent upon the defense to demonstrate partiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.956" offset="13242787">And in order to do that, one of the things that they must do is demonstrate some reason to... why the trial court should distrust a juror's statement about whether or not they have an opinion in the case, and that simply was not done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.358" offset="13308406">The amicus brief suggests that jurors come into court eager to please the trial judge and eager to give the right answer and seem to be fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.088" offset="13359293">We suggest that jurors are real life people with real life problems of their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.690" offset="13377788">And they're called into court at cubstantial inconvenience and with... to hear a grisly murder case for a week with the ultimate wrenching prospect of deciding whether an individual should live or die.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.536" offset="13429092">They don't have a particular incentive to sit on jury duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.219" offset="13443825">Their practical incentives far counterbalance any kind of inclination they have to give some answer that theoretically the trial judge suggests; and in fact, the record in this case shows the trial judge didn't suggest that he wanted the jurors to say they could be impartial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.822" offset="13510281">In five different ways he gave them the opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.135" offset="13523551">He rephrased the question and gave them the opportunity to say that they could judge the case fairly... they could not judge the case fairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.171" offset="13559704">And as soon as one or more of them did, he excused them for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.506" offset="13577050">We submit that the adoption of this rule would go farther than this Court gone in requiring voir dire questions in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.071" offset="13619264">In Turner v. Murray, in Ham v. South Carolina, where this Court has required specific types of voir dire questions, what the court has required is that the juror be confronted with a possible source of bias and asked to search their conscience and state whether they would be subject to that bias or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.446" offset="13700766">The question mandated by the court in Turner was the defendant, Willy Lloyd Turner, as a member of the Negro race.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.039" offset="13727097">The victim, Jack Smith, was a white Caucasian.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.550" offset="13737233">Will these facts prejudice you against Willy Lloyd Turner or affect your ability to render a fair and impartial verdict based solely on the evidence?</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.405" offset="13764609">And the question mandaeed... the questions mandated in Ham v. South Carolina were similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.507" offset="13784984">What Mu'Min wants to do here is far more intrusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.950" offset="13798777">What he wants to do is search the juror's memory for facts and then dispute the juror's statements about the juror's reaction to those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.027" offset="13835139">That kind of intrusive inquiry has never been required by this Court and we submit that it should not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.502" offset="13860948">The effects if it were would be undesirable on the American jury trial system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.685" offset="13881742">It would require individual voir dire in one method or another in every case to prevent other jurors from being exposed to this information that one juror may have that supposedly would be contaminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.144" offset="13935554">There would be no principled way to restrict the inquiry to simply cases of pretrial publicity as Justice Stevens' question I think brought out and as Mu'Min conceded at trial, the same logic would apply in other situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.824" offset="14002323">In death penalty qualification, if a prosecutor wants to probe a juror's assurances that they can follow the law and consider imposing the death penalty--</text>
