            <text syncTime="37.827" offset="280827">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="38.228" offset="282395">This case is here on certiorari to the United States court of appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.569" offset="299740">That court issued two rulings adverse to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.843" offset="316876">First, on the mortgage swap issue as just discussed in the Cottage Savings case, the Fifth Circuit agreed with the United States that there was a materially different requirement in the tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.709" offset="360344">It then disagreed with the United States on application of that requirement, concluding that these mortgage... these pools of substantially identical mortgage loans were in fact an exchange of property that is materially different.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.047" offset="413634">The second, unrelated issue, the Fifth Circuit held that when Centennial's depositors incurred a penalty under Federal law for early withdrawal of their savings from certificates of deposit and Centennial deducted that penalty from the savings before turning them over, that the depositors were actually discharging their savings and loan of part of its obligation to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.182" offset="502241">That meant that the income to Centennial was entitled to special deferred treatment under section 108 of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.797" offset="528677">The Fifth Circuit was wrong with its... in its conclusion with respect to the mortgage swap issue, and it was wrong in its conclusion with respect to the section 108 issue, and the judgment below should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.484" offset="575384">The facts with respect to the mortgage swap issue are not, to coin a phrase, materially different from the facts in the Cottage Savings case.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.250" offset="610493">In April of 1981 Centennial and a trading partner decided to enter into one of these swaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.243" offset="638496">They plugged their mortgage loan portfolios into the computer, came up with $8.5 million in book value of loans that matched.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.681" offset="672246">Centennial then sold its loans to its partner for $5,662,045, and its partner sold its loan to Centennial for $5,662,043.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.468" offset="727312">Conducted no independent valuation of the loans, applied a common discount factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.781" offset="744553">If the loans matched up, they were worth the same.</text>

            <label>Mr. John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="171.843" offset="816860">--There's not a material difference in the two cases on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.945" offset="829294">Centennial reported no loss to the bank board, deducted a $2.8 million loss on its tax return, which the Commissioner disallowed for failure to satisfy the materially different requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.181" offset="874225">For reasons I have already stated, the Commissioner's decision is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.247" offset="894496">The R-49 match-up ensured that the loans that were given up were substantially identical to those that Centennial got back.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.571" offset="927724">The differences in borrowers and collateral were not a material difference because the parties to this transaction in this market didn't consider those significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.607" offset="967952">In fact, Centennial conducted no credit checks, performed no appraisals of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.672" offset="988119">It didn't even know who the borrowers were at the time of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.613" offset="1003897">It didn't get the files on the loans until 6 years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.515" offset="1015495">The market also regarded these now-claimed differences as not material.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.760" offset="1036497">In this case, as I mentioned earlier, the district court found as fact that the secondary mortgage market was unable to and did not differentiate between these pools of loans on the basis of the borrowers and the collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.398" offset="1091041">A contrary conclusion would require overturning that factual finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.090" offset="1109849">The Fifth Circuit, which concluded that the loans were materially different, did so because of its view of the nature of this transaction and this type of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.740" offset="1156452">It disregarded the factual findings of the district court as to what the market was like and what the property was like.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.494" offset="1179439">The second issue presented in this case concerns the treatment of income that Centennial received when its depositors paid penalties required by Federal law for the early withdrawal of their savings.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.091" offset="1233879">In 1981 Centennial had income of over $250,000 from such penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.965" offset="1257284">Centennial claims that this is income by the reason of the discharge of indebtedness, and therefore entitled to special deferred treatment under section 108 of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.682" offset="1296155">It is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.962" offset="1301275">It is income by reason of the receipt of a penalty, a penalty mandated by Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.047" offset="1325621">The fact that Centennial used an offset as a method of paying the penalty doesn't mean that the loan was at any extent forgiven.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.943" offset="1365222">It simply means that that was the method of payment that they used.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.276" offset="1378597">Now, in a typical income from the discharge of indebtedness case, if I loan you $1,000, payable in 2 months, and then after 6 weeks, for reasons of my own, I need the money early, I have doubt about your ability to pay at the end of the term, we get together and agree to call it quits if you pay me $800.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.799" offset="1460622">In that situation, you have $200 of income by reason of my forgiving you that much of your debt.</text>

            <text syncTime="351.021" offset="1533555">And you say to me okay, I'll pay it off early, but you'll have to pay a penalty of $200.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.258" offset="1578486">Suppose it's put that way.</text>

            <text syncTime="370.734" offset="1612445">In your hypothetical, however, that would not be income from the discharge of indebtedness.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.207" offset="1634284">It would be income from the receipt of the liquidated damages that we'd agreed to prior to the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.690" offset="1656226">The key question is whether there is one obligation or two obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.584" offset="1671795">In the case that I put, where all we know is that you owe me $1,000, payable in 2 weeks, and we agree to lower the debt, I forgive some of the debt, there is only one obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.221" offset="1718398">The only obligation is yours to pay me $1,000 in 2 weeks.</text>

            <text syncTime="414.522" offset="1787570">The language of the statute, by reason of the discharge of indebtedness, looks to the source of the income that's received.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.950" offset="1829262">In your case you have $200 income because you received the damages we agreed to, or in the facts of this case the penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.694" offset="1868236">I was obligated to you to pay that.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.986" offset="1881402">The fact that there was a condition precedent to triggering the obligation of my wanting my money back doesn't alter the fact that there are two separate obligations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1535.616" offset="6271959">In both cases the Government argued that the exchange of shares in the new corporation for shares in the old corporation causes gain to be realized in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.512" offset="6311560">And in Weiss the Court said well, because the new corporation was... was incorporated in the very same State, and therefore presumably had the same rights and powers as the old corporation, the shares really represented the same property interests that the old corporation shares did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.786" offset="6384599">There wasn't in effect any potential for different consequences to flow strictly from the fact that you had two different shells.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.011" offset="6409467">In Marr, on the other hand, the new corporation was organized in a different State, and Justice Brandeis noted that the different noted that the different State, it therefore had different rights and powers under the new State's law, and therefore it was materially different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.027" offset="6461608">He didn't ask whether the shareholders knew what those rights and powers were, whether the market knew.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.301" offset="6486685">The fact is the shares of stock were still valued at the same price on the market, so that although there may be different risks involved, the market can't perceive what the difference is at that time, but it's the potential for significant different consequences that makes the difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="1839.384" offset="7486966">That's why in this case, in all these mortgage exchange cases, all the 9 court of appeals judges and all of the 16 tax court judges that considered the issue held that loss was realized.</text>

            <text syncTime="1879.472" offset="7647358">Finally, finally I do think the prior discussion about mutual funds, about stocks, about bonds, demonstrates that it's difficult to reconcile the Government's position about this, and I think the easiest example to see that in is in the case of Triple-A bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.593" offset="7723844">If I happen to hold an investment in Triple-A bonds of one company, and those bonds have gone up substantially in value, and I want to diversify my investment, under the Government's argument I think I can call my broker and say I want you to exchange my bonds for other Triple-A bonds, having the same interest rates, the same maturities, the same payment schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.578" offset="7815795">I don't care who the issuers are, so long as they are Triple-A.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.080" offset="7829797">And I can say to myself I haven't realized any income because I don't care who the other issuers are.</text>

            <text syncTime="1946.114" offset="7913911">More aggressive taxpayers, I think, can use that kind of analysis to deal with stocks.</text>

            <text syncTime="1963.876" offset="7984964">And its risk analysis is only in terms of what is the potential consequence that can happen.</text>

            <text syncTime="2448.032" offset="9921578">And the reason it says that is because interest income is accrued as it is credited to a depositor's account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.468" offset="9955328">So that if the bank credits interest quarterly, under these CD arrangements the depositor is entitled to withdraw the interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.973" offset="9985317">So all the ruling is saying is once it's in his account and he can withdraw it, it's no different than his principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.178" offset="10018231">It's as if he took the money out and redeposited it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.400" offset="10027113">And so therefore, they say, once it's income to you, you can't retroactively go back and say it's not income because you forfeited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.674" offset="10060132">They say you treat it as a separate... as a separate deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.809" offset="10080716">That doesn't answer the question, however, of whether that separate deduction is income by reason of the discharge of indebtedness to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.983" offset="10117392">It's simply dealing with the depositor's side.</text>

            <text syncTime="2721.041" offset="11013601">The Columbia Gas case that we cite in our brief, we believe is exactly this case, in the sense that in that case a corporation issued certain bonds that were convertible into stock before maturity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.260" offset="11062502">And the bond document specifically said that if a bondholder chooses to convert into stock prior to maturity, that any interest that has accrued in the meantime, from the last interest payment date until the date of conversion, will not be taken into account in the conversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.802" offset="11140661">That is, stock will not be given for that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.874" offset="11152990">So that the bondholder forfeited that interest, paid a penalty equal to that amount of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.858" offset="11176919">And the issue in that case was whether or not the corporation has discharged of it and had realized income by reason of the discharge of indebtedness because of that interest that it was... that it was released from, and the court held it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.764" offset="11220491">And the court of claims in Bethlehem Steel case also held it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.549" offset="11239717">In our view the Government doesn't say that case is wrongly decided, it simply says, well, there was no obligation to make a payment in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.583" offset="11271795">And we say that there was just as much an obligation to make a payment in that case as there is in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.376" offset="11298963">Neither one of them... do the documents talk about making a payment, having an obligation, but in both cases there is an amount that gets, in advance, agreed to be forfeited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.564" offset="11331773">The more basic point really is that the medium of payment characterization of discharge of indebtedness income to which the Government is trying to push our case really doesn't have anything to do with situations in which the discharge, the penalty, the forfeiture, is all integrally related to the initial creation of the debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.685" offset="11412230">It's very easy to distinguish those cases because they deal with totally separate, independent obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.600" offset="11443890">It's the independence that draws that doctrine into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.053" offset="11457683">It's not that there is a separate obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.484" offset="11467400">So that in the painting, house painting case, for example, that's on page 16 of the reply brief of the petitioner, where he suggests, in the context of our facts, that we can continue to think about this example, if the depositor says to the bank here is my $100,000, but if you paint my house you only have to return $95,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.947" offset="11549216">The Government uses that example to suggest our "but for" test is incorrect because it says there too the bank would not have realized income but for the fact that it... that the debt was discharged, because it... he says... the bank didn't... the depositor didn't contract to pay the bank to paint his house.</text>

            <text syncTime="3095.667" offset="12512194">Very brief, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.907" offset="12517105">On the mortgage swap issue, it's important to keep in mind what the taxpayer is trying to accomplish here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.402" offset="12551064">He is trying to have his cake and eat it too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.693" offset="12560259">He structured a transaction to ensure that the pools of mortgages that were swapped would be substantially identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.588" offset="12587844">Because they were, because they did not change his economic position, the taxpayer showed no loss to the bank board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.263" offset="12614489">They said our position hasn't changed, everything is the same, and then turned around and, industrywide, claimed hundreds of millions of dollars of tax losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.710" offset="12652315">As one of the district judges noted, it is almost ludicrous to maintain, as the taxpayer does and must, that something can at the same time be substantially identical and materially different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.429" offset="12707172">Their position rests on that inherent contradiction, and I would respectfully urge the Court not to embrace that position.</text>

            <text syncTime="3152.242" offset="12738414">Of course, isn't it also somewhat ludicrous to assume the savings and loan industry didn't suffer all these losses?</text>

            <text syncTime="3155.574" offset="12751789">It certainly suffered the losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.307" offset="12758685">They did not realize the losses as a result of these swap of substantially identical pools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.851" offset="12780837">On the section 108 issue I will take one more run at Justice Stevens' hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.084" offset="12809781">There is no income from discharge of indebtedness, forgiveness of indebtedness in that case, because there is no forgiveness of any obligation at all, either to forgive the indebtedness or as a method of offset.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.114" offset="12861921">The debt obligation is simply being satisfied according to its 90 or 30 different terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.110" offset="12889924">The Columbia Gas case, as Justice Stevens points out, the issue in that case was whether there was income at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.401" offset="12915106">It wasn't litigated as an issue of whether it should be income from discharge of indebtedness or regular income.</text>
