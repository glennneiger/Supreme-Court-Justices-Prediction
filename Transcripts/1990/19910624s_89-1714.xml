            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73968">The opinion of the Court in No. 89-1714, Pauley versus Bethenergy Mines and companion cases will be announced by Justice Blackmun.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="10.873" offset="117436">This rather complicated litigation concerns the Federal Black Lung Benefits Program created to provide compensation for minors disabled due to pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mine employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.781" offset="189011">We have before us three cases, as the Chief Justice indicated, one from the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and two from the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.812" offset="229135">They center on regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor under a congressional directive that the regulations "shall not be more restrictive than" regulations issued by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare when that department administered the program earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.293" offset="323072">There are statutory presumptions of eligibility and provisions allowing the agency to rebut the presumption by four methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.958" offset="357762">Under the earlier HEW regulations, there were only two methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.887" offset="377511">And the issue, therefore, is whether the Department of Labor regulations are more restrictive.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.685" offset="400708">The Third Circuit ruled that they were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.626" offset="412410">The Fourth Circuit ruled that they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.339" offset="423277">So, our task was to resolve the conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.152" offset="438533">We hold today that the rebuttal provisions are not more restrictive and thus, affirm the judgment of the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.175" offset="470611">We reverse the judgment of the Fourth Circuit and remand those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.040" offset="490046">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.534" offset="504048">Justice Kennedy took no part in the consideration or decision of the cases.</text>
