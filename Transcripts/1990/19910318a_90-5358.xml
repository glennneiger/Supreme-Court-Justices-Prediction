            <text syncTime="11.500" offset="184418">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.712" offset="197270">This is a sentencing guidelines case of some consequence to criminal defendants and practitioners of criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.294" offset="223601">As you know the sentencing guidelines implement a charge offense system of sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.807" offset="245649">Under the guidelines a defendant expects to be sentenced or the offense or offenses for which he is convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.913" offset="274070">There are defined exceptions to that general rule, and the guideline at issue in this case contains one of those exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.948" offset="302178">The exception is that when a defendant enters a guilty plea containing a stipulation which establishes an offense more serious than the offense of conviction, that defendant can expect his base offense level or, if you will, his presumptive sentence, to be based on the stipulated offense, not the offense of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.253" offset="383366">The issue in Mr. Braxton's case is whether the technical term "stipulation" can be so broadly interpreted that a defendant who refuses to stipulate, who makes it clear on the record that he does not intend the stipulation, denies committing the more serious offense, and keeps in issue an essential element of that offense may nevertheless be found to have stipulated because he acknowledges the Government's factual proffer on the offenses to which he intends to plead guilty.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen J. Cribari</label>
            <text syncTime="102.499" offset="548355">It came up in the extremely ordinary fashion of turning to the Government at the appropriate time during the Rule 11 inquiry and asking for the factual basis for the plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.264" offset="591405">The Government proffered what its facts would be... had... would the case go to trial, and Mr. Braxton acknowledged those facts as acts that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.349" offset="623797">At the same time he maintained that he did not intend to kill anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.392" offset="639993">It is clear in the statement of facts that the Government proffered, that Mr. Braxton, who has been on a community release from a mental hospital, had stopped reporting for his medication.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.359" offset="683774">The marshals had been dispatched to bring him back.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.793" offset="693596">When they identified who they were and why they were there, he then threatened them.</text>

            <text syncTime="145.264" offset="719405">And when they kicked his door open, he fired shots at the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.667" offset="733093">I think it's important to bear in mind factually that Mr. Braxton... and the evidence would be clear on this... did not fire through the opening of the door at the people outside.</text>

            <text syncTime="163.267" offset="791503">So that when the door was kicked open, shots were fired across toward the open door, hitting the outside of the door.</text>

            <text syncTime="2762.392" offset="11187924">Second... and this is also important... defendants in general are not going to lightly agree to aggravating circumstances as part of satisfying the factual basis for a guilty plea because other things turn on it besides deciding which guideline applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.325" offset="11255738">The sentencing judge in all cases will still have the decision where within the guideline's range to sentence the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.730" offset="11289280">That is an enormous incentive right there to make... to not agree to aggravating circumstances because you want your client to see the sentence at the low end of the guideline.</text>
