            <text syncTime="13.324" offset="158257">Petitioner Charles Stevens, a 67-year-old employee of the Internal Revenue Service is before this Court today, asking it to reverse the decision of the court below, dismissing his age discrimination and employment case and to remand this case for a decision on the merits in Federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.752" offset="235893">The respondent agrees that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act entitles petitioner to this relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.563" offset="263165">Section 15(c) of the ADEA gives Federal employees the right to file civil actions in Federal district court to remedy age discrimination in their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.198" offset="317708">The parties agree that the only statutory precondition to this is that the employee must, under section 15(d), give not less than 30 days' notice of his intent to sue before filing suit, and must give that notice within 180 days of the allegedly discriminatory event.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.563" offset="403181">It is undisputed the petitioner in this case did both of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.702" offset="423765">The court before however held incorrectly that suit had to be filed within 30 days of the notice, and therefore, dismissed the petitioner's suit as being filed too long after his notice.</text>

            <text syncTime="344.125" offset="1481411">--and that this case was timely filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.843" offset="1492278">It is undisputed, of course, that the petitioner attempted to press his claim in the 15(b) administrative arena but was denied the right to do so because he started that too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.338" offset="1554240">And we do not dispute that.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.994" offset="1560928">The court below, in affirming the district court, erroneously found a linkage between the petitioner's tardiness and the... and its right to dismiss the suit, and thus construed his time default in the administrative arena as a failure to exhaust the remedies which supported its dismissal of the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.859" offset="1660402">The issue was raised in the district court, argued at some length by the respondent taking the opposite position that it is taking here today, and decided... and even conceded by respondent in its brief in opposition to certiorari as a plausible interpretation of the court of appeals' decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.894" offset="1780461">It is the subject of a clear conflict among the circuits desperately needing resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.611" offset="1803344">And I believe it would be necessary to ensure in this case that the court of appeals does not simply reiterate the failure in the administrative arena as grounds for affirming the dismissal since it has already ruled that the untimeliness was, to some degree, linked.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.868" offset="1884428">The timeliness question, almost to state it, resolves it.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.053" offset="1905117">The statute, section 15(d), contains two deadlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.020" offset="1924970">First, that within 180 days of the discrimination, the aggrieved employee must give notice that he intends to file suit, and second, that that notice remain on file for not less than 30 days before civil action is instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.764" offset="1984007">The parties are in complete accord that petitioner did meet both these deadlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.793" offset="2008040">And the court of appeals' error was based on a misreading of the second deadline of 15(d) to mean that the suit was untimely because it was filed more than 30 days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.179" offset="2061643">This question, as I say, this provision of the statute, the two deadlines, have created some confusion in dictum fortunately in other courts of appeals and does warrant correction by this Court in connection with its grant of certiorari on the first question presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.297" offset="2138129">The 15(b) exhaustion of remedies questioned is easy to resolve simply by reference to the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.933" offset="2184627">At the threshold, it should be noted that the petitioner did in fact allow the administrative process in this case to reach a final outcome of rejection of his complaint as being filed too late in the administrative arena.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.582" offset="2259233">And he awaited that determination before he filed his suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.939" offset="2276683">However, neither the district court nor the court of appeals considered this sufficient to meet the exhaustion requirement each believed should be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.137" offset="2321509">Instead, they articulated an exhaustion requirement analogous to that imposed on Federal employees who are seeking relief under title VII for race, sex, religion, national origin, or color-based discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.115" offset="2381382">And that exhaustion requirement does, under the precedent of this Court and the express terms of that statute, bar review on the merits of a claim if the administrative process has been invoked in an untimely fashion as it was here.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.391" offset="2438433">The clear language of section... of the ADEA, however, distinguishes the ADEA of... from title VII with respect to the conditions they impose on seeking Federal relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.729" offset="2499873">As noted, the ADEA requires only that civil action be proceeded by a brief notice period during which the prospective defendant may learn of the claim and remove the cause for it if that is possible within the time frame.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.363" offset="2562358">In contract, title VII expressly conditions district court jurisdiction on the aggrieved employee's participation in the administrative process and specifically ties the jurisdiction of the Federal court and the right of the employee to file his or her suit to the date on which the administrative process is either concluded or deemed by statute to have been exhausted by the elapsing of a 180-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.366" offset="2686387">In light of these differences, the analogy to title VII is clearly inappropriate and should be rejected by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.018" offset="2724944">The courts below have... will... who have found such an exhaustion requirement have relied heavily on that analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.920" offset="2760575">An interpretation requiring exhaustion has also been rejected by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which is the agency charged by both statutes with implementing the administrative enforcement procedures under those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.726" offset="2827867">Under its customary practice, this Court should defer to this interpretation should it need to look at any other body after reviewing plain language of the statute, because this is clearly a very plausible reading of the statute, consistent with its purpose, and because this is a longstanding interpretation by the agency charged with the enforcement of the statute on the basis of the agency expertise.</text>

            <text syncTime="939.340" offset="3862316">They corrected that mistake, but then they went on to say that petitioner's lawsuit was... his filing of a lawsuit was not effective.</text>

            <text syncTime="1808.055" offset="7337124">Just to make one point on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.835" offset="7348304">If the Court does reach the exhaustion issue, it is not necessary for this Court to decide whether it is sufficient for an Age Act plaintiff... is sufficient for him to file a claim with the agency and then go to court anytime he wants, thereby prematurely terminating his agency process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.060" offset="7441196">This particular plaintiff, petitioner Mr. Stevens, did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.199" offset="7461676">He got a final agency decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.198" offset="7473692">It is our position that this final agency decision was enough under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.399" offset="7498560">The act does not require any plaintiff at all to go to the agency before they go to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.442" offset="7526668">As far as Congress was concerned, all Age Act plaintiffs could go directly to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.003" offset="7548925">Therefore, it makes no sense to require an individual to get a ruling on the merits from the agency before going to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.328" offset="7582257">It would only make sense minimally to require someone to get a final decision, which this person did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.949" offset="7612663">Now, it is also our position that that is also unreasonable for reasons stated in our brief, mainly because the Act does not allow plaintiffs to bail out of the administrative process after 180 days, like the... like title VII does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.645" offset="7679537">So it does not make sense to even require petitioner to do what he did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.112" offset="7709316">However, we agree with petitioner that this individual was entitled to have his age discrimination suit decided on the merits by the district court.</text>
