            <text syncTime="223.007" offset="1024860">For reasons of public policy and practicality, the bright-line test which I have proposed would eliminate many of the problems which are addressed by the Seventh Circuit and many other circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.157" offset="1085464">The public policy considerations are essentially that any... anything which will ensure and enhance the integrity of the judicial process promotes the common good and is to be preferred over the unfettered power of the prosecutor's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.007" offset="1188909">In the Seventh Circuit, there was the approach taken that giving advice would be protected by absolute immunity because the Court deemed that to be quasi-judicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.438" offset="1254633">That approach does not resolve the continuing problem which would exist even if this Court were to adopt that.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.934" offset="1284622">There would still be the very subjective debate, definitional debate, of what constitutes advice versus what constitutes investigation or directing an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.165" offset="1329552">The factual assumptions are insupportable that would lead one to conclude that if absolute immunity were not extended to such conduct as giving advice that the prosecutor would be hesitant to give such advice and would be flooded with a deluge of litigation, civil rights litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.340" offset="1446267">The 14 years following Imbler suggest the contrary is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.884" offset="1468419">The majority of circuits have interpreted Imbler in a rather restrictive way, allowing absolute immunity only for those essential prosecutorial functions and has not expanded the application or the availability of absolute immunity to other functions such as giving advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.517" offset="1550966">One could then argue, reasonably, that in those circuits, and the majority of them have been I think applying Imbler in a restrictive fashion, one could argue then that you would see a deluge or at least an imbalance of activity against prosecutors in those jurisdictions and that simply is not in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.931" offset="1624631">There is no... been no complaint and no dicta within these opinions which suggests that these circuits are handicapped or burdened with a number of prosecutional misconduct cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1019.717" offset="4211799">It is important to realize that if the prosecutor is going to continue to give advice to police, whether it be at the local level or at the Federal level, that he must reserve some caution and some respect for the Constitution and the rights of the individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="1471.709" offset="6019681">The common law suggests that the prosecutor enjoys immunity but not absolute immunity for everything he does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.251" offset="6061895">In the State of Indiana, for example, the prosecutor is defined as a law enforcement officer, and even under State tort law, which is derived from common law, he would be exposed to a liability for false arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.355" offset="6110274">And as we've alleged in this particular case and as of... and as the facts are demonstrated on the record, Mr. Reed was instrumental and crucial in the decision to arrest Cathy Burns without a warrant, based upon his opinion that there was probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.240" offset="6169833">So the common law tradition suggests that there is perhaps a need to protect the essential function of the prosecutor, that is, the prosecutorial function, the initiation of filing formal charges and the presentation of the State's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.704" offset="6219675">But everything in addition to that, outside of that, was regarded traditionally as more of a police function and not entitled to absolute immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3168.479" offset="12806816">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.213" offset="12813712">In response to Justice O'Connor's question, although this Court may not necessarily reach the question of qualified immunity when asked by the trial judge to rule on a direct or a motion to dismiss and a motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.393" offset="12882466">In each of those instances, the trial judge found that Mr. Reed was not entitled to qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.500" offset="12910888">But it was at the close of plaintiff's case on a motion for directed verdict that the court chose to review the Henderson v. Lopez case of the Seventh Circuit which indirectly talked about advice and simply found, not on the basis of qualified immunity, but simply found on the basis of the Henderson case, that if advice was... giving advice was involved, then the prosecutor was absolutely immune without getting to the specific activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.239" offset="13017885">And what is created as a... is confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.065" offset="13037111">And in response to Justice Scalia's question, you have the inevitable problem that if you have a police officer interrogating an individual at the police station and in the process shredding the Constitution to tiny bits with the prosecutor standing there advising him of the questions to ask, then the police officer is entitled only to qualified immunity based upon the hypothetical and the prosecutor gets absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.306" offset="13134078">What a couple circuits have said, that is so inconsistent that the police officer must be entitled to raise the affirmative defense of good faith, because what he has done is sought the best advice possible and in doing so, he has drawn himself into the shadow of the absolute immunity protection.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3266.376" offset="13198339">We have said that qualified immunity is an objective standard insofar as our involved cases in which the plaintiff tries to show that, that the defendant knew it was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.542" offset="13259048">And we said it didn't matter whether he knew it was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.885" offset="13268452">If the average person wouldn't have known it was wrong, the qualified immunity defense applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.274" offset="13289977">But do you know of any cases where we have or other Federal courts have rejected a good faith defense by someone who sought legal advice and although somebody else might have known otherwise, he, on the basis of legal advice, thought what he was doing was right?</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.001" offset="13352879">But I don't know any.</text>

            <text syncTime="3307.688" offset="13363642">I believe that I can't right now cite you to one, Justice Scalia, but I believe have run across at least two cases in preparing where the courts have said it would be an inconsistent outcome to hold the prosecutor absolutely immune and to find that the police officer was not entitled to any immunity, although he might otherwise be, because he sought the advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.585" offset="13463221">And the dilemma that would... that all the courts would face if the arguments were adopted of the Solicitor General and the respondent would be that the trial courts would still be faced with the dilemma of discerning the difference between investigative activities and giving advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.561" offset="13527168">There is no simple advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.202" offset="13533647">That occurs in the classroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.107" offset="13541275">The police officer sought advice expecting to get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.450" offset="13550679">The prosecutor gave it expecting that it would be followed and in this particular instance on numerous occasions at critical junctures of the investigation, the advice was clearly intended to direct... the force of the investigation was clearly intended to violate Mrs. Burns' rights by first hypnotizing her, then by detaining her on the opinion... on his opinion that it was without... that it was based on probable cause, but without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.940" offset="13644615">Had he gone to the court and had he presented the information as is required by the Fourth Amendment to the court in an open and candid fashion, there would not be a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.593" offset="13683276">And what he has tried to do is to say that because this is in the nature of a quasi-judicial function, or is intimately associated with the judicial process, that he's entitled to absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.681" offset="13731655">I respectfully submit that that is not the case.</text>
