            <text syncTime="50.233" offset="332000">We are here on a case determining the validity of a Missouri mandatory retirement provisions... provision for State court judges.</text>

            <text syncTime="63.242" offset="384036">One is whether to those judges in Missouri who are appointed to office, whether or not they are covered by the protections of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.009" offset="423115">With regard to judges in Missouri who are elected to office, we have maintained that the mandatory retirement age for those judges violates the equal protection guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.626" offset="473584">The decision below by the Eighth Circuit was that with regard to the elect... with regard to the appointed judges, they were not covered by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act because the act exempts appointees at the policy-making level, and the court held that judges in Missouri are policy makers, and hence not covered by the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.721" offset="570028">The Eighth Circuit also ruled that there was a rational basis for the mandatory retirement of all judges, and hence did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="279.035" offset="1247227">And that would be, in our view, the State of Missouri is an employer hence covered by the act, and that a judge is an employee and hence covered by the protections guaranteed by the ADEA.</text>

            <text syncTime="415.893" offset="1794649">And there was some... the suggestion is there was some resistance in the rural area where people wanted their judges to be elected and run for election.</text>

            <label>Mr. James B. Deutsch</label>
            <text syncTime="1658.030" offset="6763243">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.933" offset="6778812">This case contains many interesting issues of statutory construction and legislative history, constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.470" offset="6809009">I plan to first address, as my colleague did, the appointed officials' exemption, although I will then address the elected officials' exemption, because we do believe it is properly before the Court, and I do intend to seek the benefit of that exemption for the State of Missouri, finally concluding with the constitutional issues, if I have time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.481" offset="6877032">If Missouri's Non-Partisan Court Plan judges are appointed officials, as the petitioners contend, then they are most certainly appointed officials on the policy-making level within the meaning of the ADEA and exempt from the requirements of ADEA by the language of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.901" offset="6946727">I will tell you that the language of this statute is not a masterpiece of legislative draftsmanship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.386" offset="6972640">I do not find it to be clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.266" offset="6980164">However, I do find from the legislative history that there were at least two motivating purposes in Congress' mind, and the first of those was federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.304" offset="7020288">The first principle that Senator Irvin had in mind in introducing this amendment was that he did not want to infringe upon the prerogatives of the State in the selection of their own government officials, their own form of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.940" offset="7070861">The second principle was one that has already been announced, and that is that the Congress realized that some officials in government had their own cleansing agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.796" offset="7106283">The ADEA seeks to prohibit the use of age as an across-the-board method for taking people out of public as well as private employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.814" offset="7146407">However Congress did understand that, for instance, elected officials stand before the electorate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.747" offset="7166155">They have their own problems to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.299" offset="7180366">They do not need coverage of the ADEA, and indeed it is unwise, for many of the reasons that were earlier stated, that they should do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.074" offset="7211400">The voters are the ones that decide whether elected officials have done their job and whether they are competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.557" offset="7237313">These two principles, I think, when read into the statute for an understanding, although still not creating crystal clarity, I think makes it clear that the Congress chose broad language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.856" offset="7286528">The Congress said appointed officials on the policy-making level, in addition to three other exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.190" offset="7311919">They chose broad language, they chose to favor federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.533" offset="7329264">It is our argument to this Court that the Court should indulge them that favoritism towards the Federal system and agree that all State judges were intended to be exempted by this particular provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.892" offset="7382658">The... there appears additionally nothing in the language of the statute or within the legislative history which excludes judges, and this goes to the question of a clear statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.530" offset="7437202">While this may be an unusual case, perhaps, for the application of a clear statement because the Congress did say on the one hand it applies, and then turned around and said but it doesn't apply to certain people, we do believe that given the interests of federalism which were certainly in the minds of the Eighth Circuit court of appeals, clearly in the mind of the First Circuit court of appeals in EEOC v. Massachusetts, that the principles of federalism that the Congress had in mind indicates that any mention of the judiciary in the language of a statute which otherwise did not deal with specific officials was probably intentional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.405" offset="7584742">It was intended to be broad, intended to be broadly read.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.487" offset="7597071">Additionally, we would suggest that the contention that judges are not policy makers be categorically rejected by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.075" offset="7635419">Judges most certainly are policy makers, at least in the State of Missouri, which is a common law State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.288" offset="7656317">The list of decisions from our courts that have outlined and defined the common law and set the policy for the State of Missouri is endless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.582" offset="7689440">And more than that, I think that the rather disparaging nature of describing judges and their work to be law in fact computers that simply apply known principles of law to established fact, is something that only happens in the easy cases which usually get handled by two lawyers and their clients, and doesn't even make it before a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.305" offset="7768330">Courts deal with cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.847" offset="7774495">They deal with disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.675" offset="7777839">They deal with real problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.668" offset="7785780">It is inappropriate to describe a judge on any basis but that of being a policy maker.</text>

            <text syncTime="2522.068" offset="10219347">We ruled, however, that the legislator may be appointed to office because this is an elective office under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.212" offset="10244007">So our law in the State, which we respectfully urge that deference be given to, does make this an elective office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.658" offset="10281728">And as I was beginning to get back to your point, Justice White, the thing to understand about the Missouri system is that it is essentially a bit of a bargain between the members of the judiciary and the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.498" offset="10333137">The members of the public want the highest caliber, highest quality judiciary they can find.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.692" offset="10357901">We have found in our State that elections often do not provide the highest caliber lawyers, the highest caliber officials that we are looking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.667" offset="10397816">We have found that appointment works to that end.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.910" offset="10406802">However, what we have done is create a very tough selection process, very hard to get in.</text>

            <text syncTime="2577.084" offset="10439507">And we have granted essentially super-incumbency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.788" offset="10454240">The judge who is appointed serves an enormously long time, particularly on the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.752" offset="10478169">12 years for our court of appeals judges, 6 years for our circuit judges.</text>

            <text syncTime="2597.168" offset="10519755">It is true that no one has ever not been retained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.431" offset="10540862">That's, I think, a matter of pride in the State of Missouri, because we do take pride in our judiciary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2612.128" offset="10579628">And that is the price that the voters of Missouri in 1970 enacted overwhelmingly, and I think based upon experience in the State of Missouri, that a mandatory retirement age guarantees that the benefits of this super-incumbency will not carry on forever, that it will end, and that the benefits of being able to move new people into the system, into the judiciary, will be obtained through an orderly attrition created by mandatory retirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3048.766" offset="12326175">I don't find anything that is that clear of a statement concerning the Fourteenth Amendment, and therefore I would conclude, as some courts have, that the Commerce Clause is the basis upon which the ADEA was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.382" offset="12376644">I think that perhaps with the disposition of this Court's rulings between National League of Cities and the Garcia case, I have noticed a decline in the number of times that that finding has been necessary to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.420" offset="12420843">I think it was probably an issue when it was thought important to avoid the reach of National League of Cities in order to not have the ADEA declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.217" offset="12463997">But since 1983, in particular with EEOC v. Wyoming, it does not seem to be a very necessary feature to declare it to be under the Fourteenth Amendment at this time.</text>
