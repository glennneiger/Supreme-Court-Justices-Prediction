            <text syncTime="2757.514" offset="11159780">The... just two terms ago in Eu, it was held that the First Amendment protects the rights of political parties to endorse candidates to speak on candidates running in party primaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.717" offset="11224564">I submit that is difficult to see how the rationale of Eu does not apply with equal force to nonpartisan elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.420" offset="11263330">I would like to address... I think there is a very fundamental misconception, a very fundamental confusion in the compelling argument put forth by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.548" offset="11311917">Their primary compelling interest, they assert, is the impartial administration of government, and they found that on the Letter Carriers decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.037" offset="11353818">But I submit that he is... that petitioner has confused two very distinct concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.632" offset="11372208">On the one hand, as Letter Carriers spoke, there is an interest in the impartial execution of the laws, which meant the execution and enforcement of laws without bias or favoritism toward any party or member.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.128" offset="11426229">In a local context that would mean whether I supported the winning or losing candidate for mayor, I have an equal expectation that my garbage will be picked up once a week just like everybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.267" offset="11474713">The concept that they tried to throw in to bring into Letter Carriers rationale is impartial policy making.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.373" offset="11503134">They would have... they argue that there's only one right way to run a city or a county.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.469" offset="11531555">And they also argue that parties, based on evidence of 100 years ago, are these engines of evil, and therefore parties are driven to pressure the local official to act in a way to decide a policy that is not the right way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.227" offset="11602608">I submit that their syllogism is fatally incorrect.</text>

            <text syncTime="2967.968" offset="12001550">If I could return to Letter Carriers for just a short minute, Los Angeles County has a population of approaching 9 million people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.018" offset="12053795">It is larger than the population, it has a population larger than that of 42 other States in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.132" offset="12078246">The leaders of Los Angeles County and all the other cities and counties of this, of our State, face very controversial, very difficult policy choices every day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.679" offset="12124430">And there is no one right way to make those choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.943" offset="12141462">The elections of the leaders of these cities and counties necessarily will involve discussions about both the voters' views and the candidates' views of these policy choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.400" offset="12191304">It is expected, the voters expect that there will be discussions, or how else will they make a decision on who to, with respect to who to vote for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.336" offset="12227039">In these discussions political parties historically in our country have played a very important role, and we submit that section 6(b), by taking away that role, does great disservice to the First Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.195" offset="12282419">Petitioner ignores the fact that in Brown v. Hartlage it was recognized that candidate commitments enhance the accountability of government officials to the people that they represent, and assist the voters in predicting the effect of that votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.017" offset="12357756">This Court also held in Brown v. Hartlage that some promises are universally acknowledged as legitimate, indeed indispensable to decision making in a democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.886" offset="12401224">If in my remaining time I could speak very briefly to the issue of judicial elections, States throughout our Nation employ many different methods of selecting and retaining judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.473" offset="12463604">Every method has its advantages, and of course plenty disadvantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.547" offset="12479904">California has opted for a system where we have retention elections, and in some cases contested elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.374" offset="12511147">The necessary result of that selection is that there will be discussion about judges, discussion of their records, discussion of their qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.750" offset="12548659">The asserted threat to judicial independence, of which petitioners speak of, is attributable not to the fact that political parties may participate in that process, but rather to the underlying decision to subject judges to elections in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.889" offset="12613233">Perhaps the most dramatic episode of the asserted threat to judicial independence was in 1986 retention elections in which three justices of our supreme court were defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.099" offset="12666105">$7 million were raised by various special interest groups to defeat those justices, and it was, there were commercials, there were discussions focused on their views on the record, and specifically on the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.390" offset="12727232">Voters cast those three justices out of office and, as Justice Groton wrote in adjudicature article, the polls indicated that the basis for casting those three justices out was not integrity or competence, but rather their death penalty position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.630" offset="12800166">I raise this issue because political parties in 1986 did not play a role in those elections, and that illustrates the gross under-inclusiveness of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.477" offset="12847604">Petitioner also ignores the fact that both Bridges v. California and Craig v. Harney teach that we should presume that judges are able to withstand criticism and are able to withstand pressures in elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.491" offset="12931614">Even the California Judges' Association, which adopted the California Judicial Code, has the same presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.347" offset="12959095">In the Judicial Code it states, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.837" offset="12969021">"judges should be unswayed by partisan interests, public clamor, or fear of criticism. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.592" offset="12992009">end quotes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.323" offset="12994935">I submit that to assume that judges are not persons of fortitude, able and willing to withstand the pressure of the electoral marketplace, is to do them a great disservice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.150" offset="13042269">In closing I would submit to this Court that First Amendment jurisprudence teaches us that the free flow of information, particularly with respect to candidacies, particularly with respect to governmental affairs, is essential to our democracy and must be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.184" offset="13126383">I submit that it would be wrong as a matter of law and as a matter of public policy to silence political parties on the very issue that they were formed to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.280" offset="13162850">I would request that the Ninth Circuit's decision be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3269.949" offset="13209452">First a couple of very quick just factual points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.293" offset="13218856">Justice Stevens, it was this part of the case which arose in the context of a... of an endorsement that was sought to be placed inside the voter pamphlet, as the third cause of action states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.822" offset="13280923">And I don't remember which Justice asked the question about whether this was, 6(b) was the only basis for taking that endorsement out, but California Elections Code section... now I seem to have lost it, 10,012, states that the... a candidate statement shall not include the party affiliation of the candidate or membership of activity in partisan and political organizations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3319.753" offset="13408714">And that provision is not challenged in this case?</text>

            <label>Mr. Dennis Aftergut</label>
            <text syncTime="3323.904" offset="13425328">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.975" offset="13429612">The point that was made about the Democratic Party, if it collects 1 percent of the vote, the State makes the party remain an official party, I submit is an absurd proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.444" offset="13479454">If the party does not wish to be an official party and participate in the primary system, it can collect 10 percent of the vote, the State does not force it to participate in the party system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.710" offset="13516548">There was a question about corruption being the only justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.106" offset="13538073">Corruption has not been the only justification for upholding State regulations of First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.722" offset="13560538">The ballot access case is Jenness, Storer, and so forth, American Party v. Texas, v. White.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.996" offset="13593661">Those are cases which deal with what is at issue here, a State's structuring of its electoral system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.292" offset="13622814">And what those cases recognize is that when the First Amendment, when the associational rights and the rights of political groups to communicate with their members, when the First Amendment interests meet the practical realities of structuring a governmental system, the Court looks at the structural system with greater deference and tends to uphold those unless they are arbitrary or unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.220" offset="13730543">And that's basically what all of the arguments of, my opponents ignore is the structural interest that section 6(b) serves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.976" offset="13769622">And as an example, Mr. Chao says that it's, he's very hard pressed to distinguish this case from Eu, that is Eu doesn't refer to nonpartisanship or partisanship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.867" offset="13821135">But if the Court looks at how Eu justified, how it rejected the compelling interest that the State offered, the Court rejected the Attorney General of California's reliance on Storer for the proposition that the measure there promoted political stability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.308" offset="13890935">The Court said this measure only promotes party stability, not political stability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.793" offset="13912877">And what the Court said is that Storer does not stand for the proposition that a State may enact election laws to mitigate intra-party factionalism during a primary campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.672" offset="13956345">And the Court said preserving party unity during a primary is not a compelling State interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.598" offset="13984035">We're not trying to preserve party unity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.571" offset="13991976">We're trying to preserve California's system of nonpartisanship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.750" offset="14004724">And basically the danger here that we seek to avoid is that parties that have chosen to accept State conferred benefits have an enhanced voice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.999" offset="14053625">The State weighs in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.910" offset="14057282">And particularly where those... where that advantages converges in single party localities, they... parties can skew the debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.767" offset="14096780">It's not that parties have an equal voice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.680" offset="14104407">Parties have an advantage by the State.</text>
