            <text syncTime="1744.591" offset="7106427">There's no dispute in this case that the text and the legislative history of the act, the age act, are silent as to any congressional intent to prohibit arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.017" offset="7160135">The FAA in that circumstance mandates arbitration unless there exists an inherent and irreconcilable conflict between arbitration and the purposes of that age act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.325" offset="7213320">That's the issue for this Court to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.377" offset="7225545">Such a conflict cannot be shown here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.877" offset="7235576">Indeed, enforcement of the arbitration agreement here complements the ADEA's purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.114" offset="7260445">A comparison of the act's purposes with arbitration eliminates a concern about any conflict existing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.338" offset="7297330">The act's purposes are contained in section 2(b) of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.373" offset="7313526">They are threefold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.773" offset="7319168">Number one, to promote the employment of older workers; number two, prohibit arbitrary age discrimination; and number three, to help employers and employees find ways of meeting the problems impacted with regard to age.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.502" offset="7386042">The choice of arbitration clearly does not conflict with any of these purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.489" offset="7409970">To the contrary, the enforcement of the provisions... the enforcement provisions chosen by Congress shows that it preferred that multiple methods be available to employers and employees in meeting problems under that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.467" offset="7481859">As one alternative, Congress provided for court enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.787" offset="7503175">Noteworthy they provided for court enforcement in any court or competent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.758" offset="7527103">It is not restricted to the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.210" offset="7540896">It is very similar to the '33 Securities Act which this Court addressed in the Rodriguez case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.281" offset="7565137">This Court commented that the wider choice of court provision in that statute indicated a congressional intent of allowing wider choice of alternatives for resolving claims under that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.790" offset="7623234">Before any litigation, what does Congress provide?</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.492" offset="7637967">Congress expressly favors in the statute... resolution of disputes through voluntary means.</text>

            <text syncTime="3313.264" offset="13381039">In their argument that the purpose of the age act is so paramount or so important that it ought to be treated differently, and I assume they feel the same way about Title VII, in our view that was rejected in Mitsubishi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.856" offset="13435478">That argument was made in Mitsubishi that the importance of the act there was so paramount that, that the Court should not allow enforcement under the FAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.450" offset="13493784">In that decision Justice Blackmun pointed out that a concern for statutorily protected classes provides no reason to color the lens through which the arbitration clause is read, provides no reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.578" offset="13566300">You don't look at is the class age victims, or is the class black employees, or is the class securities customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.617" offset="13602453">That has been rejected in Mitsubishi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.402" offset="13613634">Indeed, in October 1989 this Court rejected, in my view, a very analogous case, the Second Circuit case in Bird v. Shearson Lehman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.527" offset="13658146">It vacated and remanded that in light of the Rodriguez decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.312" offset="13677268">While I certainly don't know the precise reasons, it seems to me that the strong language in McMahon, Rodriguez, based on Mitsubishi, has eliminated this sort of public policy, this sort of value judgment that somehow this statute is different, or this statute is so important that arbitration just should not be allowed to touch it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.594" offset="13762427">I think it's implicit in the vacation and remand of that that that argument is long gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.629" offset="13778518">That, of course, is what this Court said was the primary underpinning of the Wilko v. Swan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.985" offset="13807985">In fact, in Mitsubishi the Court also rejected the Second Circuit's standard known as the American Safety Equipment Standard, which was, again, a case that focused on... the Sherman Act in that case was viewed to be so different and so important that it could not be arbitrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.482" offset="13897950">In... I think it was the McMahon case or Mitsubishi, this Court took those and point by point rejected the underpinnings.</text>
