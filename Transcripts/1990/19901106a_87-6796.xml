            <text syncTime="9.728" offset="165280">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="23.287" offset="219510">James A. Ford is here after the Georgia Supreme Court, in light of this Supreme Court's ruling and remand, failed, in our opinion, to apply an adequate and independent state ground to justify the denial of his reef... relief, under Batson v. Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.588" offset="280741">In this case Mr. Ford, a black defendant, was tried in Coweta County, Georgia, on a capital murder case.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.834" offset="309685">At the time of this trial, Mr. Ford's lawyer filed a motion specifically asking the court pretrial to restrict the prosecutor from using its peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner that would exclude members of the black race from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.565" offset="364647">In fact, in the argument of that motion pretrial, Mr. Ford's lawyer specifically asked the court to require the district attorney if he does use his peremptory challenges to exclude potential black jurors, to justify on the record by his reasons for doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.082" offset="418668">And he went on to say the failure to do so would conclude, lead to the conclusion that it was only done because those jurors were in fact black.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.068" offset="446671">At the time this motion was made the court and the prosecutor was clear that Mr. Ford was asking for relief, not only in terms of what Swain v. Alabama held, but beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.455" offset="492229">He was asking for relief in his specific case.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.336" offset="499752">In fact, he also had complied completely with the uniform appellate procedure in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.082" offset="522635">That procedure at the time required counsel to pretrial file motions on all issues so that the court could rule on them in a timely and reasonable fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.808" offset="553564">Moreover, that procedure did not say anything about specifically how peremptory challenges should be handled, because in 1984, when this case was tried, there were not procedures in Georgia specifically telling counsel about the time and manner in which these arguments could be made.</text>

            <text syncTime="676.660" offset="2833009">In Sparks the court makes clear and says it is perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.271" offset="2847429">The court in Sparks says hereafter any claim under Batson should be raised prior to the time the jurors selected to try the case are sworn.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.738" offset="2881283">That is 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.419" offset="2888075">And finally, and most significantly, the Georgia Supreme Court went on to say that Sparks, having failed to comply... Sparks is in a worse position, we submit, than Ford.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.857" offset="2929767">In Sparks there was no pretrial motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.037" offset="2938544">The first objection by Sparks did not come until after jury selection, after the jury was sworn, and after evidence was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.411" offset="2964039">And yet the Georgia Supreme Court decides that Sparks would receive the benefit of this new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.196" offset="2987132">And Mr. Ford, whose case was tried 30 months before Sparks was decided, whose appeals were perfected 19 months before Sparks was decided, the Supreme Court of Georgia says, has no availing argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.673" offset="3033003">The lack of an adequate and independent state ground, we submit, is another and clear basis for this Court to disagree with the Georgia Supreme Court's ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.290" offset="3071559">This Court has consistently said that these State procedures must be firmly established and regularly followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.196" offset="3099145">In Sparks it is clear it's the first time that any procedures were established, and it's clear it's the first time that any procedures were followed, and they were not in existence at the time Mr. Ford's case was litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.384" offset="3143866">Moreover, in Staub and the Court's most recent pronouncement in Osborne and other cases, this course... this Court has made clear that defense counsel should not be forced to engage in an arid ritual, a meaningless forum, and try to preserve these claims when in fact in this case Mr. Ford, given the law that existed, given the uniform appellate procedure in Georgia, and given his understanding of what he had to do, made a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.359" offset="3235817">He also had a firm ruling from the trial court in terms of what he could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.812" offset="3249610">He also had a in-trial colloquy where in that colloquy the court goes on to say, in fact, that 9 out of 10 black jurors had been struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.717" offset="3285241">They weren't all struck, but regardless of that, the trial court said it doesn't matter now.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.243" offset="3307288">I have ruled, I have denied Mr. Ford's relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.904" offset="3317946">There is nothing he could have done to preserve his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.867" offset="3329858">In fact, as the dissenting opinion says in Ford v. State the second time around, the dissent, I think, is significant in noting that Mr. Ford, and the Government seems to argue, could not have won this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.675" offset="3377088">He could not have preserved Batson even if he had objected during that colloquy.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.549" offset="3388581">The Government seems to argue that he was given many opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.923" offset="3406031">In a case called Riley v. State, the Georgia Supreme Court made it clear that once trial has commenced and the jury has been sworn, that it would be inappropriate for counsel to then rely on a Batson claim to avail him of an opportunity to challenge the prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory way.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.395" offset="3479906">We submit that on the basis of all of these facts, that the Government has not been able to sustain its burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.538" offset="3500490">Moreover, no one has been treated like Ford in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.301" offset="3515537">The Government refers to various cases decided by the Georgia Supreme Court after Batson and before Mr. Ford's case was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.357" offset="3551794">In all of those cases they are distinguishable, as we submit, and more importantly, all of those cases follow Mr. Ford's actual conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.104" offset="3582723">The closest case that the Government cites is Child v. State, decided by the Georgia Supreme Court, but Mr. Childs raised the issue for the first time on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.620" offset="3620862">He didn't raise it in a pretrial motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.789" offset="3625564">He didn't raise it after the jury had been selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.502" offset="3632356">And moreover, the reference to Sparks, we submit, is unavailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.173" offset="3651060">Additionally, we would submit that this Court in Griffith made clear and, for whatever reasons, decided that when these cases are remanded, if it's on direct review, that those parties who establish Batson's claims should have the opportunity for redress in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.436" offset="3716052">And we submit that Griffith certainly supports that proposition, and that this Court should consider exactly what the Georgia Supreme Court did in denying relief for Mr. Ford in this case before the Georgia Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.274" offset="3763491">Finally, what we ask the Court to do as you think about this case, Mr. Ford's case is unique for a number of respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.618" offset="3788882">The first is that Mr. Ford, unlike any other case that we have been able to find, filed a motion pretrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.723" offset="3817199">It's clear that the Georgia Supreme Court and the Georgia trial courts at that time could have outlined procedures saying there are various reasons by counsel should file these motions pretrial, as opposed to during trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.572" offset="3864637">One obvious reason would be if you file it pretrial and you give notice to the prosecutor, you won't be sandbagging him.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.985" offset="3886266">And it's clear in this case there is absolutely no argument to justify that the prosecutor, the court, or anyone was sandbagged.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.021" offset="3914479">If there is any sandbagging, the sandbagging occurs when the Government and the court... the Georgia Supreme Court for the first time announces a rule and applies it to Mr. Ford, when in fact he had no opportunity to remedy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.707" offset="3953140">The second point, as equally significant, is that the Georgia Supreme Court, if they had thought about procedures, could very well have said don't raise these issues pretrial, but raise them after the jury has been selected, because we don't want to inject race into the case until it's significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.247" offset="4007370">That might have been a procedure, whatever the Georgia Supreme Court might have done, or whatever rules might have been existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.641" offset="4024924">That is fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.582" offset="4028686">There were no clear rules in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.393" offset="4035896">To the extent that they were, counsel complied with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.057" offset="4046554">The Georgia Supreme Court in ruling ignored its own precedent and created a whole new ruling for counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.074" offset="4078632">And we would submit that in light of these new guidelines being applied to Mr. Ford in these circumstances, that the Court should rule in Mr. Ford's favor and remand this case to the Georgia Supreme Court, instructing that court to ask the trial court to have a hearing consistent with the requirements of Batson v. Kentucky.</text>

            <label>Ms. Paula K. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="2498.066" offset="10118665">It was the motion for mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.577" offset="10120650">And in the Mincey case, which we cited in our brief, the Batson claim was preserved by making a motion for continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.911" offset="10146041">So, again, we submit this evidences the rationale of the Georgia Supreme Court in finding that it was not that he didn't comply with Sparks, but that he made no objection whatsoever at trial to the manner in which this jury was selected that was fatal to his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.101" offset="10206750">And in answer to one of your earlier questions, Justice Stevens, Georgia does not apply a procedural default rule, a waiver of the waiver by the State rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.029" offset="10242485">If the trial court has reached the merits, that does not bind the Supreme Court of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.643" offset="10260980">By the same token, if the State did not assert procedural default or if the trial court rejected procedural default, that does not bar the Supreme Court of Georgia from applying procedural default.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.820" offset="10297656">We submit that the crux of the case is what this Court meant by the remand order in Griffith, and we submit that there's a distinction between retroactivity and preservation of a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.653" offset="10357006">Under the principles of retroactivity an examination is undertaken to see if a rule is in fact applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.624" offset="10380830">Under preservation of the claim one assumes the applicability of the claim, but merely looks to see if the claim itself is preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.229" offset="10411236">And we submit that that is all the Supreme Court of Georgia did here in this case, and found that petitioner's conduct did not fall in line with those persons in Batson, Griffith, and Brown, who had not had the benefit of this Court's decision telling them to object, but perceived the claim as being based upon the challenge of strikes in their trial, and evidenced some sort of timely dissatisfaction through objection, motion for mistrial, or whatever form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.546" offset="10508516">And we submit that the decision of the Supreme Court of Georgia in this case is not inconsistent with Griffith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.171" offset="10535057">And we would urge this Court to conclude that the decision was proper, that it rests upon an independent and adequate State ground.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles J. Ogletree, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2613.327" offset="10579674">Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.282" offset="10607468">There are only three points I wish to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.343" offset="10615723">In this particular case, when this case was presented to the Georgia Supreme Court, the Georgia Supreme Court clearly concluded that a proper Swain claim had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.980" offset="10654279">At page 51 of the joint appendix the Georgia Supreme Court and the remand characterizes the motion as properly made under Swain, and in fact, at page 55 of the joint appendix, when the Georgia Supreme Court had the remand, makes clear that Swain's motion... that Ford's motion under Swain, having been decided adversely to him on appeal, cannot be reviewed in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.485" offset="10740274">I think first of all it establishes that Swain had been made properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.138" offset="10754903">And more importantly, it seems the Georgia Supreme Court is ignoring that... this Court's remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.431" offset="10768069">It is saying in effect we are not going to review this case in light of what the Court requested that we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.806" offset="10789594">Sparks, again, we say is significant in that Sparks could not have complied and did not comply with the procedure announced in Sparks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.350" offset="10819791">Sparks' objection did not occur until after the jury was selected, sworn, the judge had given preliminary instructions to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.916" offset="10849989">So in terms of the rule, he would not have made it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.187" offset="10859079">And in fact the government at this point is contending that Sparks adequately made a showing, and we submit that he did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.421" offset="10884052">Moreover, this Court, we submit, can say that the prosecutor's exercise of 9 out of 10 peremptory strikes to strike the black jurors is a prima facie case, and without rebuttal by the State in this case, that it would be an adequate basis for Mr. Ford to prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.424" offset="10956046">Finally, we would submit that, on this record, that it shows that this Court, looking at Ford, has yet another opportunity to correct much of the injustice that has occurred and the whole line of racial discrimination in jury selection procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.874" offset="11017904">From Strauder through Swain and Batson and Griffith, this Court has consistently tried to prevent any form of discrimination preventing defendants from having fair trials, and preventing prosecutors from excluding... excusing citizens from their right to serve as jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.526" offset="11080493">That principle was clearly stated in Strauder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.586" offset="11088748">It is just as clear in Batson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.748" offset="11093346">And we submit that Mr. Ford, in his unique circumstances, should not be denied the opportunity to submit to this Court an argument that Batson should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.145" offset="11130962">And we urge the Court, in light of this record and in light of the arguments today, to find as Mr. Ford has urged in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.450" offset="11156144">Thank you.</text>
