            <text syncTime="62.884" offset="373760">It was her former husband, who, at least so far, has been permitted to use the Federal Bankruptcy Code, in the words of the dissenting Just... judge in the court of appeals, to steal from his former wife.</text>

            <text syncTime="214.531" offset="980323">A number of lower courts in situations like this have called this an equitable lien, have tried to suggest that it is not a judicial lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.119" offset="1022642">But it would be very difficult for me to come here and suggest that it isn't a judicial lien, because it was a lien imposed by a court in a divorce judgment, and that's going to happen whether or not it's a stipulated divorce or, like this case, a divorce in which every issue, including the division of property, was contested.</text>

            <text syncTime="730.770" offset="3045251">She got half of the marital estate, and what could be better than a lien, a security interest imposed by a judge, to protect that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.145" offset="3086733">It was better than a mortgage until, of course, a few months later Mr. Sanderfoot began the bankruptcy process, filed a motion under 522(f), had that motion denied by the bankruptcy judge, and then in relatively quick succession reversed by the Federal district judge, and in a 2 to 1 decision reversed by the court of appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2431.855" offset="9849626">Now, why shouldn't I think that the code feels the same way about real estate, that basically where there is a simultaneously, a simultaneous creation of your interest and the lien, which is what happens with a purchased money security interest, you should not be able to get out of it?</text>

            <text syncTime="2502.402" offset="10131853">It says an interest, and "an" is the dictionary equivalent of the term "any".</text>

            <text syncTime="2547.882" offset="10313770">The question is, the term "fixing", is it used as a term of art, which I don't believe it is.</text>

            <text syncTime="3067.912" offset="12393848">She and Gerald Sanderfoot shared a marriage, a home, a marital estate, for 20 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="3148.593" offset="12716617">Finally, how does that spouse who leaves the home, man or woman, come up with the equity or the cash to establish her own homestead or his own homestead?</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.231" offset="12763115">The respondent concedes that the result in this case is... so far at least, has been harsh.</text>
