          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist">
            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text>We'll hear argument next in No. 89-964, Raymond J. Moskal, Sr. v. United States.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dennis_m_hart">
            <label>Mr. Dennis M. Hart</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>From the lofty world of holding companies to the more mundane world of a 1984 Ford, I'd like this Court to revisit section 2314 of title 18 and decide what Congress meant when it inserted two words into that statute 50 years ago.</text>
            <text>Those two words are "falsely made".</text>
            <text>As petitioner sees it, the question, really the bottom line question is whether the term falsely made means false in execution versus false in content.</text>
            <text>The Government has asserted, and so far they have won that assertion, that the term should mean false in content.</text>
            <text>They call this the broader definition of the two words.</text>
            <text>The petitioner submits that this Court should reject that position, because in the final analysis the only good reason the Government can give for defining falsely made as false in content is that it catches more people, and we don't think that should be good enough for a criminal statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>xxx claim that you have to give some meaning to this provision, and it hasn't any meaning if it really... if we accept your interpretation of the statute it has really no meaning.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dennis_m_hart">
            <label>Mr. Dennis M. Hart</label>
            <text>Yes, sir, that is their first argument, and if the tape could reflect that I am scratching my head, because I don't know why it must have an independent meaning.</text>
            <text>Certainly courts, the lower circuit courts who have considered the question have often used the words forgery and falsely made interchangeably, and--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Don't we usually follow the principle that each... each word or sentence or phrase of a law is supposed to be given an independent meaning so that it won't be simply superfluous?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dennis_m_hart">
            <label>Mr. Dennis M. Hart</label>
            <text>--Yes, and that is the general rule.</text>
            <text>I do agree with that.</text>
            <text>But that is not a rule that covers everything, because, as I think anyone who reads these statutes can find that the words falsely made, forged, altered, or counterfeited are sort of a term of art, that are contained in dozens of Federal statutes.</text>
            <text>And falsely made is never defined.</text>
            <text>And that is why lower courts over many years have always concluded that falsely made equals forged, with the exception of one or two cases which the Government points out.</text>
            <text>Yet the Government also agrees--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Like this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dennis_m_hart">
            <label>Mr. Dennis M. Hart</label>
            <text>--Yes, Your Honor, like this case.</text>
            <text>The Government also agrees that that is not, number one, the common law definition of falsely made, and number two, they also agree that if you are to give this the independent meaning which they advocate, it is a much broader definition than what courts have normally accepted.</text>
            <text>But even if we accept the United States' position that this must have an independent meaning, the term falsely made, we believe this Court can supply that meaning, that is, give an independent meaning to the word falsely made, yet still not necessarily include the conduct for which petitioner is charged with, that is the inclusion of false information in an otherwise valid document.</text>
            <text>Now, the second position the Government advocates is that... if I can phrase this correctly... is that they agree that the common law definition of falsely made would not include what Mr. Moskal did.</text>
            <text>They also say that Congress is usually presumed to know what the common law meaning was, and that it is the usual presumption that Congress used the common law definition when they wrote the words.</text>
            <text>Yet they then argue that Congress cannot be presumed to use the arcane, or what they call the antiquated definition of the word.</text>
            <text>And then they argue that what we posit as falsely made is arcane and antiquated.</text>
            <text>And we submit they have never shown that.</text>
            <text>We submit that the only reason they can suggest the broader definition is more modern is that it encompasses more conduct.</text>
            <text>Yet the United States and petitioner both agree, number one, that there is nothing in the statute to indicate that Congress wanted to expand the common law definition of falsely made.</text>
            <text>There is no legislative history that indicates Congress wanted to expand the common law definition of falsely made.</text>
            <text>And there is no subsequent conduct by the Congress which reflects on that.</text>
            <text>Now--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Hart, may I ask whether there is any other statutory provision under which your client could have been charged for transporting these Virginia certificates?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dennis_m_hart">
            <label>Mr. Dennis M. Hart</label>
            <text>--Certainly, Your Honor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>What might that be?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dennis_m_hart">
            <label>Mr. Dennis M. Hart</label>
            <text>He was also charged with section 513 violation, which is the possession of forged State securities.</text>
            <text>There were two counts in the indictment for that.</text>
            <text>But even if that... that were not permitted he could be charged under the mail fraud statute.</text>
            <text>I think this Court last term decided a case, I am going to call it Schmuck, I can't remember exactly how it is spelled, where the operation was nearly identical to what Mr. Moskal did.</text>
            <text>This Court affirmed that conviction.</text>
            <text>But if this Court will remember, that man was not charged with section 2314 at all.</text>
            <text>He was charged with mail fraud, criminal mail fraud.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Could Mr. Moskal have been charged under section 2314 with regard to the Pennsylvania certificates?</text>

          <turn speaker="dennis_m_hart">
            <label>Mr. Dennis M. Hart</label>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Just not the Virginia titles.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dennis_m_hart">
            <label>Mr. Dennis M. Hart</label>
            <text>Certainly, and let me--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But he wasn't charged with transporting those?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dennis_m_hart">
            <label>Mr. Dennis M. Hart</label>
            <text>--No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>And that... that really... the crux of our argument, is that the Government argues that Mr. Moskal has found a loophole in this law and he is trying to squeeze through it.</text>
            <text>And they say this with such force that it makes me even feel guilty when I read that.</text>
            <text>But that is really rhetoric, because Mr. Moskal didn't determine the charges that were placed against him.</text>
            <text>The U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania decided to charge him only with the Virginia titles.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Is this whole case just a tempest in a teapot then?</text>
            <text>If we decide for you the Government isn't hurt, because it could have charged him with transporting the Pennsylvania certificates.</text>
            <text>Is that it?</text>

          <turn speaker="dennis_m_hart">

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">

          <turn speaker="dennis_m_hart">
            <label>Mr. Dennis M. Hart</label>

            <text>Exactly, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>Well, let me take that back.</text>
            <text>I should add, in response to Justice O'Connor's question, that it also is a violation of State law.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Yes, but not subject to Federal prosecution under a licensing scheme such as that of Virginia.</text>
            <text>Is that correct?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dennis_m_hart">
            <label>Mr. Dennis M. Hart</label>
            <text>I am not certain I understand the Court's question.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Dennis M. Hart</label>
            <text>That's a... that's an important question, I think.</text>
            <text>I would be happy to answer it in detail.</text>
            <text>The Pennsylvania titles were physically altered.</text>
            <text>They were changed.</text>
            <text>They were changed in a number of ways.</text>
            <text>They were changed in Pennsylvania by what in the title-washing business is called an artist.</text>
            <text>The artist takes the titles, changes them, gives them to an office manager, who is Mr. Moskal.</text>
            <text>Mr. Moskal sends them to another State, and in this case it was Virginia.</text>
            <text>The titles come back clean.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Now, in Virginia... how would you describe those washed certificates?</text>

            <label>Mr. Dennis M. Hart</label>
            <text>No, as our back-up position, if I may point that out, a number of courts, lower courts have considered the question of materiality, and they have concluded, quite frankly, that odometers are a material part of the transaction.</text>
            <text>But they have done that in the context of stolen cars and frauds in which the identity of the owner was concealed, in which vehicle identification numbers were changed.</text>
            <text>A traditional fraud in which cars are... are stolen, in which cars are, the parts are interchanged, in which new vehicles are made and titles are created to reflect ownership of that vehicle, which is a fraud in itself.</text>
            <text>So that is my problem with wholeheartedly embracing that position, is that the lower courts have always considered materiality as an important part, as what they call material, only in the context of stolen cars.</text>
            <text>And that's not the case here.</text>
            <text>The United States, as their final argument, believes that broad purpose of 2314 as an antifraud statute could only be upheld by a definition of the broad meaning of falsely made.</text>
            <text>We don't believe that's the case.</text>
            <text>We believe this Court has considered similar arguments, for instance when this Court considered the case of bootleg records, as whether they were counterfeit or whether they were stolen, under 2314 and rejected that.</text>
            <text>Although this Court many years ago considered the prospect of the inclusion of aircraft as vehicles under the predecessor of the Motor Vehicle Theft Act, the statute, the language of the statute at that time said any vehicle that... any self-propelled vehicle that wasn't on rails, if it were transported would be a violation of the Motor Vehicle Theft Act.</text>
            <text>And the Government's position was well, you now have airplanes, and if you steal one of those it should be included in that because the meaning was arcane and antiquated.</text>
            <text>This Court rejected that argument.</text>
            <text>We think similar reason should apply to this case.</text>
            <text>There is no indication that Congress ever considered this type, this specific type of fraud.</text>
            <text>That is... and I will admit that it's a fraud.</text>
            <text>But the specific conduct of sending facially valid titles from one State to another as within the gambit of 2314.</text>
            <text>And this Court has... has long concluded that when Congress has the will it makes thing clear.</text>
            <text>When this Court has to make decisions for what Congress didn't talk about, because it's a criminal statute, the less broad meaning has preference, that the Government position in this case to broaden the statute is given a very careful and scrutinous eye by this Court.</text>
            <text>But our position is that this Court does not have to reach that... that interpretation of what Congress meant, because the plain meaning of the words falsely made, even if this Court must assign an independent meaning to those words, can be defined as conduct which does not cover Mr. Moskal's conduct.</text>
            <text>And of course then we reach the problem of... of notice.</text>
            <text>Because if the Government has their way, they have a problem with the notice requirements of criminal statutes, and exactly what Mr. Moskal did was that effective notice to all individuals.</text>
            <text>We suggest that if the Government has its way in broadening the statute, they have that problem.</text>
            <text>But we suggest that--</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale</label>
            <text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>This case presents the question whether washed automobile titles constitute falsely made securities within the meaning of section 2314.</text>
            <text>Our position is that they are, for essentially three reasons.</text>
            <text>First, the ordinary meaning of the term falsely made securities fits those documents.</text>
            <text>Second, that interpretation accords with the history and purpose of this statute.</text>
            <text>And third, there are... is no canon of construction that would justify imputing an artificially narrow interpretation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Who made that... how were these Virginia certificates falsely made?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_l_nightingale">
            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale</label>
            <text>Your Honor, the making of a automobile title involves the incorporation of information from the prior title, plus some additional information supplied by the new purchaser to State authorities.</text>
            <text>They then return a new title incorporating the information.</text>
            <text>A washed automobile title is falsely made because that process is corrupted through the addition of false information, and the end product, the Virginia title bearing false odometer figure, is indistinguishable in substance from the classic forgery, a situation in which you get a purportedly valid document that is capable of being used to mislead used car purchasers.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And so the same rationale would apply to the color of the car on the title?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_l_nightingale">
            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale</label>
            <text>There may be a limit on the statute for materiality.</text>
            <text>I mean, if you made a mark on an automobile title that had no effect on it, whatever, that might not violate the statute.</text>
            <text>But the color of the car I don't think would fall within the de minimis situation.</text>
            <text>That would be a means by which, if for example it was a stolen car, someone could mislead the purchaser as to the true identity of the car.</text>
            <text>But I believe that a false addition or an introduction of a falsity through this process--</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale</label>
            <text>--The name of the seller would qualify, because it would prevent the purchaser from being in touch with him to find out the history of the car.</text>

            <text>Your Honor, I would in this sense, that if you had a valid title and the only alteration was the addition of a pencil mark on it, I guess it would be altered in some sense.</text>
            <text>But it would be completely immaterial.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale</label>
            <text>That is a general principle, yes, Your Honor, but it's... it's one that has some important limitations as well.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale</label>

            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale</label>
            <text>Your Honor, in this case the option was available, because Mr. Moskal was both the sender and the receiver.</text>
            <text>He was at both ends.</text>
            <text>But I want to add, in light of the Court's questions about the significance of this case, that that is by no means a certainty in these cases.</text>
            <text>There are many cases in which... potential cases one can visualize in which a different person sends the altered documents one way, then receives them on the return trip.</text>

          <turn speaker="stephen_l_nightingale">
            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale</label>
            <text>--In some of them, right, but in this case the evidence demonstrated that the documents were sent by Federal Express, and in some cases hand carried.</text>
            <text>And the prevailing rule in the courts of appeals right now is that Federal Express does not qualify as a use of the mails.</text>
            <text>So that was not an available option in this case.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Nightingale, don't you think it's at least a reasonable meaning of falsely made, when I say a document is falsely made, that I would... assuming it means something beyond the common law meaning, don't you think I would think that the person who made it must know that it's false, as opposed to just having been given incorrect information and then he writes it out, and you say it is falsely made because he has written down false information that somebody else has given him?</text>
            <text>That's a very--</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale</label>

            <text>I would... I want to point out as well that--</text>

          <turn speaker="stephen_l_nightingale">
            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale</label>
            <text>--Let me indicate... let me refer to a case decided 8 years ago by the Court, Bell v. United States, in which the question was whether a statute that prohibits people from taking and carrying away money from a bank was designed to extend beyond common law larceny.</text>
            <text>Now, those words had a distinct common law ring to them, and the question was did... did Congress, when it enacted a statute prohibiting taking and carrying away money, mean to incorporate all of the common law limitations.</text>
            <text>In general the common law required that the taking be from the possession of the owner rather than the acquisition of title.</text>
            <text>And the Court found that in the context of a statute that was designed to protect banks from losing money, the distinction between title and possession made no sense whatever.</text>
            <text>And essentially that is our position in this case.</text>
            <text>In the context of securities there is no difference in substance between a document run off an illicit printing press with a false odometer reading and a document prepared by means of the scheme that Mr. Moskal and his confederates followed.</text>
            <text>The question is in the context that Congress acted, did the statute... would the distinction drawn by the common law make sense.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>--Well, you could have said that about the common law, too.</text>
            <text>The very first statute wouldn't make... I don't know why there is anything special about this statute.</text>

          <turn speaker="stephen_l_nightingale">
            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale</label>
            <text>Your Honor, in fact in the common law there was difficulty with your proposition.</text>
            <text>There is a case cited in our brief, Count de Toulouse Lautrec, in footnote 10 of our brief on page 17.</text>
            <text>The facts there were that a printing company printed securities for a corporation, printed a few extra copies for its own files by way of samples of its work.</text>
            <text>The defendant obtained the samples and negotiated them as valid bonds.</text>
            <text>And that defendant was convicted of forgery.</text>
            <text>The Court found that where there was no authority to use the documents in that fashion there was a forgery.</text>
            <text>There was another case, one not cited in our brief, Commonwealth v. Foster out of Massachusetts in around the 1870's.</text>
            <text>In that case the defendant called in a gentleman who had the same name as a rather well known commercial firm, had him sign some notes in his Wilson &amp; Co., by Mr. Wilson, and then that person took the... of course Mr. Wilson was not a party to the fraud.</text>
            <text>The defendant took those notes out and represented them to be the notes of the large commercial outfit.</text>
            <text>And again there the Court held that that qualified as forgery.</text>
            <text>This is illustrative, Your Honor, of the sorts of distinctions and difficulties that were present in the common law at the time Congress was called upon to legislate in the area of falsely made production of securities.</text>

            <text>Well, if at the time the statute was passed the committee report had said</text>

            <text>Maybe I should back up and review the history of this statute.</text>
            <text>In 1934 Attorney General, the Attorney General sent a set of bills to the Hill, all of which had as their common purpose the creation of Federal criminal penalties for criminal activity that extended across State lines.</text>
            <text>Congress enacted those bills, recognizing that interstate criminal activity is more difficult to detect, it is more difficult to prosecute, threatens, in a large number of cases, more serious harm to the individuals.</text>
            <text>As originally enacted that bill, the National Stolen Property Act, prohibited the interstate transportation of stolen securities; 5 years later Congress extended the prohibition by adding a separate paragraph including falsely made securities.</text>
            <text>And it is fair to assume that Congress' intention in enacting the extension was its recognition that... of the difficulty of detecting and apprehending offenders and prosecuting those sorts of offenses.</text>
            <text>There is no distinction in terms of that context, and I recall Bell again, where the purpose was to protect the assets of banks.</text>

            <text>A check signed by an agent, purportedly for a principal, in which the agent has no authority is at common law not a forgery.</text>
            <text>The reasoning behind that is that that check is made by the person purporting... is endorsed by the person purporting to make it.</text>
            <text>It contains, though, only a false representation, which is that the agent had authority to act for the principal.</text>

            <text>I thought we'd give the fuzziness to the defendant.</text>

          <turn speaker="stephen_l_nightingale">
            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale</label>
            <text>Your Honor, again harkening back to the Bell case, the words take and carry away have both an ordinary meaning and, as my colleague indicates, they have a term-of-art meaning.</text>
            <text>The common ordinary meaning is when you go into a bank without money and you come out with money, that is taking it and carrying away.</text>
            <text>The common law term-of-art meaning was that when you go into a bank without money you have to get it by means of a scheme that involves depriving the victim of possession.</text>
            <text>And I think that the same can be said of this situation.</text>
            <text>If we walked out through those doors and asked 100 people in the street whether there was a difference in substance between the documents that Mr. Moskal sent to Virginia and those that came back, 100 people would fail to perceive that.</text>
            <text>They would all recognize that the corruption of the process of making, through the introduction of the falsity, made those documents falsely made.</text>
            <text>Now it is true that at common law those words had a somewhat narrower meaning.</text>
            <text>They entailed a basic distinction which, as I have indicated, was somewhat riddled with fiction, that there was a distinction between truth in the execution and truth in content.</text>
            <text>But I believe that there's a situation there where we have a common ordinary meaning that can be given effect by the Court in the context of this statute.</text>
            <text>Again, without harping on it, it's fair to point out that Mr. Moskal's confederates were paying the people in Virginia $100 to convert the altered documents into washed documents.</text>
            <text>They recognized that not only were they equally deceptive, but they were significantly more deceptive enough to justify the $100 a shot.</text>
            <text>And in that situation, and given the common ordinary understanding of falsely made, there is no justification for reverting back to what we submit are arcane, obsolete distinctions without meaning in this context.</text>
            <text>I do want to call attention to one subsequent enactment that bears on the problem before the Court.</text>
            <text>In 1984 Congress amended the definition of security to which this statute applies to include valid or blank automobile titles.</text>
            <text>The legislative history is very sparse on this.</text>
            <text>The one indicator of Congress' intention was a committee report directed to the same bill in a prior Congress, but the indication is that Congress believed that valid titles were already covered by the statute.</text>
            <text>The amendment was needed to add blank titles to those sorts of securities that could be transported.</text>
            <text>It is clear though that in 1984 Congress understood there to be such a thing as a falsely made, forged, counterfeited, or altered valid automobile title.</text>
            <text>And it is our position that one cannot conceive of a forged, counterfeited, or altered valid automobile title.</text>
            <text>There has to be something for the... that operates on the term valid, and we believe it is falsely made.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale</label>
            <text>--Your Honor, let's focus a little bit on what automobile titles do, and then I think it will become clear why I am having difficulty with the question.</text>
            <text>States have attached different significance to automobile titles.</text>
            <text>In some States a title is the exclusive means by which you can pass title to a car.</text>
            <text>If you buy my car but I don't give you the title, I sell it to someone else, he gets it.</text>
            <text>In other States titles are prima facie evidence of ownership, but the... the transaction involves the sale of the car, and the evidence is altered to reflect the real transaction.</text>
            <text>In that context, Your Honor, I believe that we are cut loose in many States from the concept that the title is needed to pass title as such.</text>
            <text>The validity of the title, it seems to me, refers to the title being in its, in the condition that it had when it is issued by State authorities.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="stephen_l_nightingale">
            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale</label>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But in order for you to run the argument you are with respect to the 1984 statute, you would have to be able to say in all States, and therefore the 1984 statute can have no meaning unless it refers to what you claim it refers to.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale</label>
            <text>Your Honor, I think that the way that would be handled in the rules of evidence would be to say that it would go to the weight assigned to the argument, but not to the correctness of the argument.</text>
            <text>I don't believe that it's necessary to exclude all possibilities.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>No, your argument is that this '84 statute is utterly meaningless.</text>
            <text>And what I am suggesting is even if there are only a few States where the title would be valid even though there has been an alterization... alteration, the statute would not be utterly meaningless.</text>
            <text>It doesn't go to weight.</text>
            <text>It goes to whether your argument is valid or not.</text>

          <turn speaker="stephen_l_nightingale">
            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale</label>
            <text>Your Honor, I believe that the... again, looking at it in the context... let me say that the 1984 legislation that added this provision was designed to deal with the problem of washing and changing titles to deal with stolen cars primarily, although there was indication of odometer fraud as well.</text>
            <text>The committees that were dealing with the problem were told that a good way to title a stolen car would be to get a hold of an automobile title, alter the identification number to match the one of the car that had been stolen, wash that title, and then end up with an apparently valid... validly titled document.</text>
            <text>And I believe that when Congress enacted the legislation making it a... making a valid title one that could be the subject of 2314, it was intending to deal with the same aspects of that kind of fraud and scheme that we have before us today.</text>
            <text>And that they had evidence before them of... Congress had evidence before it of this type of operation, altered only in the fact that the identification number was altered rather than the odometer reading.</text>
            <text>So I believe it is a fair inference.</text>

            <text>Mr. Nightingale, at the beginning of your argument you said your third point was going to be that no canon of construction interferes with your position.</text>
            <text>Would you want to discuss the rule of lenity at all?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_l_nightingale">
            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Nightingale</label>
            <text>Your Honor, I would like to do that.</text>
            <text>I believe the classic statement of the rule of lenity is Justice Blackmun's in the Huddleston case in 415 U.S. There are two reasons for the rule of lenity in effect.</text>
            <text>One reason is to give fair notice to individuals.</text>
            <text>The second is to be sure that legislatures define crimes and not courts.</text>
            <text>And the rule is subject to the important qualification that although penal laws are to be strictly construed, they ought not to be construed so strictly as to defeat the obvious intention of the legislature.</text>
            <text>I submit that this is a case in which neither of the underpinnings of the rule of lenity are applicable.</text>
            <text>Mr. Moskal was not endowed as to the illegality of his conduct, and if he had given any attention to section 2314, I submit that looking at the common ordinary meaning of falsely made, he would not have believed that he would have been free... not free to send the documents down, but free to receive them back.</text>
            <text>In the context that this statute operates, I think that it's clear that Congress was acting against an evil, the interstate transportation of falsely made securities, which fully covers this situation.</text>
            <text>It would be highly inconsistent with Congress' intention to exclude from this statute a scheme, the essence of which was the use of interstate transportation--</text>

            <text>I had to wade through all that congressional testimony, and I didn't see one mention of odometer fraud, of title washing for roll-backed odometers.</text>
            <text>What Congress was concerned with in 1984 was interstate car thefts and what they called chop shops, the assembly of vehicles from odd parts.</text>
            <text>They were concerned with vehicle identification numbers, and there was no concern at all for odometer roll backs of title washing.</text>
            <text>The Government is in error if it tries to convince this Court that that was the purpose of the 1984 amendments.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dennis M. Hart</label>
            <text>--The... secondarily we would like to make the observation that in 1979 a district court in Iowa decided the Rudge case, which decided that what Mr. Moskal did in this case wasn't a violation of 2314.</text>
            <text>In 1980 I believe it was the Tenth Circuit in Sparrow made basically the same decision, that if it was a valid automobile title that passed title, even though it had alterations, it was not subject to 2314 prosecution.</text>
            <text>Now subsequent to that other courts have disagreed.</text>
            <text>But since 1980 Congress has had the opportunity to clear that up, and has not.</text>
            <text>And the reason I mention that is because in examining the history of 2314 circuit courts have concluded that 2314 did not cover certain things.</text>
            <text>And what comes to mind specifically is travelers' checks.</text>
            <text>There was a circuit court decision in the 1960's, I believe, that said this statute doesn't cover interstate transportation of travelers' checks.</text>
            <text>When that opinion was issued Congress came back and changed the law and said put travelers' checks into the section.</text>
            <text>They realized they could change it, they realized it wasn't there, and they made the effort to change it.</text>
            <text>And they have never done anything since Sparrow and Rudge in 1980.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But we have a different history here.</text>
            <text>Most of the lower courts have agreed with the Government, haven't they?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dennis_m_hart">
            <label>Mr. Dennis M. Hart</label>
            <text>I disagree with that entirely, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>I believe two of the circuit courts have agreed with the Government, the Tenth Circuit has agreed with the petitioner, and what we consider a similar case, the district court in Rudge have agreed with the petitioner.</text>
            <text>And so I would call it at best an even split, and at worst, for the Government, it's consideration of different factors, because no one has ever considered exactly what the petitioner did in this case.</text>
            <text>And finally we'd observe that the Government is going to get into problems if it talks about materiality, because what the Government didn't mention is that one of the titles in this case was altered by a pencil mark, just a small pencil mark in the number.</text>
            <text>And that's all that was done in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text>Now, if the Government is going to draw a bright line between vehicle model and vehicle make, and odometer, and put on the other side of the line a pencil mark, they are going to run into problems with this case.</text>
            <text>We suggest no such bright line can exist.</text>
            <text>Thank you.</text>
