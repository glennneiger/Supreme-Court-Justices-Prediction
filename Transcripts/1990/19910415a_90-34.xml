            <text syncTime="89.078" offset="489283">However, with respect to Exxon's delivery at Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the district court and the court of appeals held that that case was outside admiralty jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.115" offset="1253417">Since Minturn there has been a transformation in the legal thinking with respect to jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.079" offset="1277241">First, a contract, in order to be maritime, need not be performed substantially on the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.143" offset="1301482">Secondly, this Court has recognized that at the heart of admiralty jurisdiction is maritime commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.036" offset="1329068">The Minturn rule excludes the services provided by general agents, which all agree are critical to maritime commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.921" offset="1364594">It is for that reason that the commentators and the courts, including the Second Circuit, have urged that this Court reject the Minturn rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.908" offset="1408584">Respondent argues that to reject the Minturn rule will open up the Federal courts to suits by all agents of all types.</text>

            <text syncTime="331.267" offset="1458008">First, Minturn itself is a discrete rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.521" offset="1475040">As the commentators, and I make particular reference to Gilmore and Black at pages 22 and 29 of their treatise, have indicated that in other areas of jurisdictional... in other jurisdictional areas the jurisdiction is fairly well defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.939" offset="1532718">Secondly, there is a rational jurisdictional boundary that has already been offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.524" offset="1559050">This Court has never ruled on the so-called preliminary contract doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.038" offset="1581097">However, in the recent decision in the Second Circuit of Ingersoll Milling v. Bodena, which is found at 829 F. 2d 293, specifically at page 302, that court has offered a jurisdictional rationale which seems to make sense and is consistent with the commentators.</text>

            <text syncTime="407.098" offset="1761342">Specifically in the Bodena case there was an agent involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="421.146" offset="1817557">Under the old preliminary contract rule such services would be considered preliminary because they were preliminary to the actual marine contract, i.e. the bill of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.734" offset="1863846">The Bodena court, however, did not so hold, and it held that the services provided by the freight forwarding agent were themselves, quote, "essential to the voyage", unquote, and on that basis held that those services were not preliminary services.</text>

            <text syncTime="483.376" offset="2066452">And what was going on here was that Exxon was not only arranging under its contracts, but it was advancing its credit and it was paying for the fuel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1063.394" offset="4386544">The Second Circuit disposed of this case its per se rule that agency contracts cannot give rise to obligations enforceable within the admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.883" offset="4428444">As the briefs demonstrate, that rule has been widely criticized by other courts, by commentators, and indeed by the Second Circuit itself in the Peralta case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1435.420" offset="5874583">In other cases it may assure access to a Federal forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.431" offset="5886599">Let me discuss briefly the relationship between the statute and the lien, because I understand that is one of respondents' principal points in opposition to the result we suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.270" offset="5934037">Respondents suggest that the statute forecloses adoption of the rule that we advocate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.054" offset="5961100">The statute does not speak to what causes of action are within the admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.506" offset="5986909">If, for example, Exxon had brought an in personam action, I don't believe it could fairly be argued that the lien act would foreclose admiralty jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.663" offset="6023585">So what the lien act does, as Your Honor suggested, is to provide that when admiralty jurisdiction is otherwise available, the lien act is potentially available as a means of providing a lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.781" offset="6072069">It is not even the exclusive source of a lien, incidentally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.164" offset="6085548">It does not purport to occupy the field or exclude other arguments for a lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.537" offset="6107073">There are liens that exist independent of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.419" offset="6118566">A second point in opposition to the rule that we suggest is that it would undercut the stability and certainty in an area of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.007" offset="6168931">The devil we know is better than the devil we don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.560" offset="6183141">First of all, it's clear that the Minturn has not... the rule of the Minturn has not provided stability in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.007" offset="6224937">There is disagreement among the circuits as to whether special agents are outside the rule, as to whether managing operators are outside the rule, even within the confines of general agents as to whether this rule is a presumption or a conclusive rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.227" offset="6289825">Secondly, this Court, of course, could select from among those approaches, choose one, and make it the national rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.341" offset="6318246">But we submit that so long as the rule depends on status and not function, that the rule will continue to generate uncertainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.467" offset="6354818">The lines between agents, special agents, managing agents, are not clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.801" offset="6376134">That's point number 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.954" offset="6384702">Second point, so long as those distinctions don't line up with the substantive considerations underlying admiralty jurisdiction they will be the subject of continuing controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.141" offset="6429528">They are traps for the unwary, as presently constructed, as the Court indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.932" offset="6448650">Exxon might have had trouble anticipating that it would be considered indistinguishable from Mr. Minturn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.879" offset="6480415">Thirdly, it is not the case that the shipping industry is less important now than in the 1850's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.944" offset="6512702">This is an industry whose importance is growing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.687" offset="6527644">The grant of admiralty jurisdiction to this Court reflects, first, that... this Court and the Federal courts reflects first the national importance of that industry, and second, we believe, the judiciary's responsibility for seeing that that jurisdiction is exercised in a rational fashion, in cases like the Maret and the Genesee, in which the Court extended admiralty jurisdiction to the inland lakes and waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.713" offset="6635791">In other cases, the Court has not hesitated to reconsider decisions that have spawned uncertainty and have resulted in anomalous limitations on jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1650.991" offset="6736937">The issue before this Court is whether the rule of law that an agency contract is not a maritime contract should be overturned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.756" offset="6763895">The district court below declined to grant admiralty jurisdiction to Exxon's claim, holding that preliminary services are not within such jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1730.583" offset="7055213">Exxon in this instance placed an order a number of weeks beforehand, in fact took over an order that had been placed beforehand, typical of an agency, and then sat back, did nothing with regard to the actual supply... someone else did that, someone that they had a separate arrangement with... and then a week or so afterwards found out that the order had actually been fulfilled and then did their other administrative function of a collection.</text>

            <label>Mr. Armand Maurice Pare, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3185.597" offset="12875295">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.198" offset="12877698">First, with respect to the reference to the Columbia Law Review article by Professor Black, I believe that that article quite clearly states in the critique section that there are a list of irregular verbs that seem to have no principle, but I also believe that what the Professor says there is that in that article that is how he reads the present cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.539" offset="12955125">However, at pages 261 and then again at 273 and beyond he goes on to suggest that should not be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.056" offset="12985113">It happens to be the case now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.305" offset="12990129">Central Gulf has raised the point and says that all agency contracts are preliminary contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.220" offset="13021789">That depends on your definition of a preliminary contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.072" offset="13033179">We have urged the definition provided by the Bodena court, provided by Benedict, and provided by Gilmore and Black, that makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.877" offset="13064421">It's not a mechanical lining up of the contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.489" offset="13074870">Secondly, Exxon in this case supplied bunkers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.321" offset="13094201">That is the key ingredient to make a vessel propelled... be propelled in maritime commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.185" offset="13117711">It is the classic service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.788" offset="13124085">As the decision by the Ninth Circuit in the Golden Gate indicated, it is not necessary for the physicial supply to be made by the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.574" offset="13159193">In that case the supply was made by a third-party supplier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.224" offset="13173822">That is precisely the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.367" offset="13182390">Exxon did not make the physical supply, but that should not matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.208" offset="13197750">Furthermore, clearly, under any analysis Exxon's involvement here was not preliminary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.432" offset="13222619">The proof shows that the local supplier refused to make the supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.626" offset="13239442">If Exxon had not jumped in and put its contract on the line the supply would not have happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.900" offset="13264519">Exxon's involvement was essential to the voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.882" offset="13276431">The proof also shows that Exxon advanced its credit and it paid for the fuel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.584" offset="13295239">In fact it remained involved in this case by virtue of the fact that the contract provides if there was an oil spill Exxon reserved the right to clean that spill up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.789" offset="13328049">Also, the contract provides that, if there was a quality or quantity claim, Waterman came to Exxon for that, not to Arabian Marine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.676" offset="13359605">The Fifth Circuit case of Planned... Preplanned Premium Services does not address the general agency Minturn issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.649" offset="13387504">In fact it only involves insurance premiums, and those insurance premiums are not essential to the operation of any voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.396" offset="13418537">In fact, as I already indicated, they do not give rise to a lien, and they are not essential services.</text>
