            <text syncTime="17.273" offset="195919">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="20.803" offset="210025">This case brings before the Court a single question of statutory interpretation: whether Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act applies to acts of discrimination by U.S. employers with respect to U.S. citizens outside the territorial limits of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.212" offset="311693">In this case the Fifth Circuit, sitting en banc, held that Title VII does not apply abroad, relying on the well-established presumption that acts of Congress ordinarily do not apply outside the territorial limits of the United States, absent an expression of intent to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.127" offset="407302">The court concluded that there was inadequate evidence of Congress' intent so as to overcome the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.063" offset="443037">As a result the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of the lawsuit filed in this case by the private petitioner, Ali Boureslan.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.411" offset="488490">Mr. Boureslan is a naturalized U.S. citizen who alleges in his complaint that during the course of his employment in Saudi Arabia by ARAMCO, a U.S. corporation, that he was the victim of discrimination based on race, religion, and national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.483" offset="576680">In our view, Title VII's protections do not stop at the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.959" offset="602593">To the contrary, Congress intended for Title VII's protections to run to the benefit of U.S. citizens wherever they may be when they are in the employ of U.S. employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.629" offset="657346">Its intent, we believe, is reflected in both the text and the structure of the statute itself.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul L. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="1512.771" offset="6177855">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.824" offset="6206067">We agree with the Solicitor General that this is a question of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.420" offset="6232503">We also agree with him that what is involved here is what he today has referred to as the well-established presumption against extraterritorial application of U.S. laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.235" offset="6275762">But we think there are several problems, at least five, before one even gets to the presumption, with his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.932" offset="6306482">One is the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.563" offset="6317035">It says nothing about an extraterritorial reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.334" offset="6332187">Second is the legislative history, which says nothing about foreign work places, nothing about extraterritoriality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.920" offset="6362489">And there is no indication in that legislative history, despite the fact that there were 441 witnesses who testified, that anybody thought this was going to apply overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.527" offset="6400941">Third, the structure and the legislative history of the act talk only in terms of a domestic focus of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.660" offset="6429467">Fourth, as Justice Scalia's questions suggest, there really is no principled basis to limit this statute to U.S. employers overseas once you start down that road.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.908" offset="6478472">Fifth, to apply it overseas runs afoul of prerogatives and sovereignty of other nations and with international conventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.726" offset="6509715">And then you get to the presumption which says that Congress must speak clearly, expressly, and affirmatively if it intends a statute to apply overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.490" offset="6548794">Now I, I think I understand the Solicitor General to be saying either that the alien exemption provision itself grants coverage to U.S. citizens overseas by a negative inference, or he may be saying that it is the commerce language which grants coverage to everybody, and then the alien exemption provision withdraws it from aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.958" offset="6662583">If it is the latter, which is strongly suggested... stated... in his reply brief, we run into the very problems that the Court was discussing with the Solicitor General a few moments ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.236" offset="6703752">The commerce language</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.558" offset="6713052">"between a State and any place outside thereof. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.110" offset="6727262">is found in numerous other statutes, and this Court and no other court has ever said that those statutes apply overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.025" offset="6762893">It is found, for example, in the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1720.255" offset="7007818">So we suggest that his position is a troublesome one if he is relying on the notion that this commerce language alone provides jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.444" offset="7056614">Now, if he's saying something beyond that, which he also seems to be saying in his brief, that this statute is an example of Congress legislating on the nationality principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.084" offset="7119099">It wasn't entirely clear in the various earlier portions of this case and maybe even in some of the Solicitor General's earlier submissions to this Court, but it is now clear that he's relying on the nationality principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.572" offset="7173120">The nationality principle is a disfavored basis to exercise jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.136" offset="7191302">It applies usually in matters of allegiance, like military service and taxation, when we reach overseas to reach our nationals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.030" offset="7218887">And every time Congress has chosen to legislate on that principle, it has used the words expressly: U.S. citizen or U.S. person or U.S. national.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.787" offset="7261937">I believe it did so, except in the Department of Defense statute in... cited by the Solicitor General, and of course the Department of Defense is a U.S. person, in every single statute cited by the Solicitor General in his reply brief at footnote 13 on page 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.678" offset="7329542">With respect to anti-discrimination statutes, the only cases that I am aware of in which Congress has chosen to reach into foreign work places are the Export Administration Act, the comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, where Congress, in each case, spoke about U.S. persons, U.S. nationals, or, in the case of the amended Anti... Age Discrimination Act, American employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.467" offset="7440719">And so, regardless of whether you approach it on the commerce language approach or on the notion that Congress acted affirmatively somehow, it hasn't done it in a way that this Court has accepted that Congress must do it in order to reach into foreign territory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1935.195" offset="7867560">When you get to Foley, and Benz and McCulloch, and Foley cited Blackmer and Foley cited Sandberg, it seems to me that Foley does say... and as was pointed out earlier, it was a U.S. citizen that brought that suit... Foley does say that, that it, that Congress must express its intention to extend coverage beyond places where the United States has sovereignty or some measure of legislative control, and there was no indication that it had done so there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.778" offset="7993888">The fact that it would apply equally to aliens and U.S. citizens, the Court I believe said only, quote,</text>

            <text syncTime="1986.429" offset="8072464">In Benz and McCulloch, the Court did say that the basic question was whether Congress had written the act and intended it to apply overseas and required an affirmative intention of Congress clearly expressed, at least in the McCulloch case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.442" offset="8144562">So one pieces those together to take what in some cases was called a canon of construction, in other cases a presumption and an assumption that Congress seeks to legislate domestically, and comes up with what we call a strong presumption and I think the Solicitor General calls a well-established presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.174" offset="8227527">The Steele and Lanham Act question, it seems to me, is somewhat separate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2136.537" offset="8672967">In this statute, we have a definition of commerce and of interstate commerce which is, as the dissent below said, nothing more than a jurisdictional nexus.</text>

            <text syncTime="2159.503" offset="8764813">And... but in the section that proscribes certain unlawful employment practices, there is no reference to conduct in commerce, employment practices in commerce, and that makes... that's a distinction between all of those cases.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="3097.047" offset="12514952">Yes, I do, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.799" offset="12526028">I think we should understand what is at stake and what ARAMCO is saying, that ARAMCO and other U.S. employers are free to discriminate overseas on grounds of race, religion, national origin, and gender, and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.601" offset="12597186">Very briefly, Mr. Friedman has quite properly used the term "canon of construction".</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.795" offset="12629995">I think that is exactly what we are dealing with in terms of the judicial tools to employ in getting at the ultimate question of what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.661" offset="12673463">The presumption is, as this Court said in Foley Brothers, a canon of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.816" offset="12698018">It is an axiom of experience, it is to assist the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.689" offset="12713587">It should not be employed to require of Congress a particular form to express itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.442" offset="12740546">And when we look at what Congress did, I think the fair inference to be drawn from a reading of the entire text of this statute is that, and I will state clearly, that it is in fact the combination of the broad jurisdictional reach within the structural creation of an exemption from that broad reach which gives us comfort that Congress intended for there to be extraterritorial applicability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.031" offset="12850887">With respect to the specifics and the legislative history on Vermilya-Brown, one critical point is Vermilya-Brown was effectively revisited legislatively in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.089" offset="12899161">The problem that Congress had with Vermilya-Brown was therefore taken care of several years before the focus on the 172 bills that Mr. Friedman suggests so dominated the legislative history of the '64 statute, which is what we're about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.832" offset="12974080">That Congress was nonetheless trying to fix up a problem that had been fixed in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.316" offset="13004069">What that--</text>

            <text syncTime="3220.137" offset="13007308">But General Starr, I'm not sure I have the various language in mind, but I think the argument ran that during that fixing up of Vermilya-Brown they adopted language which was much like this, and the pattern, you just assume that when they copied language which was used previously it may have had the same purpose.</text>
