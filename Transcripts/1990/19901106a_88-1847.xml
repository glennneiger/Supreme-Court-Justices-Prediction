            <text syncTime="35.914" offset="265060">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="47.183" offset="310200">The issue in this case is whether Florida's tax on intangible property fails this Court's internal consistency test and violates the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.638" offset="348025">As I will explain in a moment, we think the case is controlled by the Court's decision in Armco, which struck down a facially discriminatory West Virginia tax that we think is indistinguishable from the Florida statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.636" offset="392015">The Florida tax is imposed annually on the full value of two different categories of accounts receivable notes and other obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.393" offset="430990">One category is based on domicile, the other one is based on business situs.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.336" offset="446768">First, if a... an intangible asset is owned by a Florida domiciliary, it is subject to the tax without regard to its business situs.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.583" offset="483757">Second, if the intangible has a Florida business situs, which is defined in the statute to mean that it arose out of a sale of property in Florida, it too is subject to the tax, but only if it is owned by a nondomiciliary.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.540" offset="535584">There seems to be no dispute here that the tax fails a straightforward application of the Court's internal consistency test, and that is so because if every State had the precise statute that Florida has, a interstate company operating in interstate commerce, domiciled in one State, selling... financing sales in another State, would pay two taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.716" offset="632342">One tax to his domiciliary State, under the domicile theory, another to the business situs State under the business situs theory.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="134.912" offset="661076">Have we previously extended the internal consistency test to property taxes?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_l_evans" startTime="139.664" stopTime="222.794">
            <label>Mr. Mark L. Evans</label>
            <text syncTime="139.664" offset="680093">Well, the answer to that is slightly involved in this sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.628" offset="707992">It has not been extended to property taxes in the name of an internal consistency test, but as we showed in our opening brief, the first instance that we could find of the Court actually using an internal consistency analysis was a century ago in a case involving a tax, a property tax, on the value of capital stock of a company that, that owned moving... moving rail cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.115" offset="809870">And to that extent we think, because we do think that the test itself, the analysis that underlies it is so deeply rooted, the answer to the question is, I think, that the Court has applied it to a property tax and in fact a tax in that case which was on intangible value.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.275" offset="870578">Just let me spell out again why I think there is a... why I think there is an internal consistency problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.001" offset="901403">If you're operating in two States... domiciled in one and financing in the other, you pay a domicile tax in effect to your domicile State, a business situs tax to your business situs State.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.501" offset="947483">But if you are operating in just one State, you pay only a domiciliary tax to your home State.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.806" offset="972665">The result is that an intrastate company who confines its operations, its financing operations to just its own State, pays one tax, while its competitors have to pay two.</text>

            <text syncTime="232.841" offset="1052809">The tax is identical in our view to the tax that was at issue in Armco.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.416" offset="1075065">Now, Armco had... Armco also had tax on... was taxed on two bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.329" offset="1090738">One on manufacturing and one on wholesaling.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.521" offset="1099515">Manufacturing tax applied to all manufactured goods in West Virginia.</text>

            <text syncTime="574.297" offset="2418595">Let me just run through why I think it would not be a good idea to open up to actual double taxation showings in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.963" offset="2453285">First of all, every... every case would produce a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.915" offset="2465093">There would be no mechanism by which these things would be resolved other than by litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.708" offset="2480244">Second, you would have the anomaly of State A, say Florida, adjudicating what Michigan in fact is taxing.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.943" offset="2509187">There may be an argument, for example, in a lawsuit brought by Ford that it is fact being taxed by Michigan on the basis of domicile, to which a State counsel might respond well, we don't really see it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.923" offset="2561119">Do you have any authority for that being the way that the State court reads it?</text>
            <text syncTime="612.965" offset="2573344">Well, we don't have any definitive authority, but we paid our bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.449" offset="2583271">Well, that is not enough, we don't see it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.519" offset="2591525">So the first issue in the State court is going to be whether Michigan in fact taxes domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.264" offset="2610542">And if it does, the second argument for the State's lawyer is, well, it's not valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.976" offset="2629351">And so you've got the bizarre situation of the State of Florida having to adjudicate both the meaning and the validity of a Michigan statute, taxing statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.412" offset="2675117">Then you have the problem of, what if you prove it?</text>
            <text syncTime="640.586" offset="2683790">Which State... which State's tax gets struck down?</text>
            <text syncTime="642.929" offset="2693194">Do you pick the one that you happen to sue?</text>

            <text syncTime="646.432" offset="2707195">Do you have to look to see whether there is an internal consistency at that point?</text>
            <text syncTime="650.055" offset="2721615">What if they are both internally consistent?</text>
            <text syncTime="651.547" offset="2727675">You may wind up with... having... allowing taxpayers to pick which statute... which statute must yield.</text>

            <text syncTime="667.109" offset="2789847">As I say, if you don't have a test that assumes that other States can do what this State is doing, which in fact will happen, as the Court knows from its long history in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.177" offset="2830180">Once it blesses a tax, other States follow it because it has been, it has been constitutionally blessed by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.772" offset="2856511">And so that, what you wind up with is either what I am describing, if you don't have an internal consistency kind of test, or you wind up with a... with having to just suffer actual double taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.649" offset="2904054">The one other consequence of requiring case by case showings is that you can wind up with a... with a patchwork.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.872" offset="2932893">You've got different taxpayers being able to establish that the tax is unconstitutional as to them, because of the States they happen to be operating in at a given time and the tax policies of that State at that moment, and other taxpayers who are identically situated, except that their State may have a slightly different policy at that moment, have a different constitutional rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.276" offset="3010529">The result of all this would be, I think, a litigation nightmare, and it's a good reason why the Court, I think, has not followed that approach.</text>

            <text syncTime="958.391" offset="3955013">--that one of the choices that the Florida legislature could make in order to make its statute internally consistent is that it would still wind up taxing us the way it does now.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.838" offset="3992838">But that is not the only choice it has.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.681" offset="4000152">It might, for example, take away the exemption that we... that we think effectively operates in Florida, which gives Florida domiciliaries an exemption from the business situs portion of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.524" offset="4039545">If it did that, then our competitors would pay, we think, equally on that... on that ground in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.440" offset="4067235">Or it could wind up apportioning, which we think in some respects is the proper solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.565" offset="4087715">Which... which is to say that if Florida's logic, the logic of its own tax, and we think, this is a point we think is very effectively made in our... in Florida's brief, that the underlying theory of the internal consistency test is that a State ought to be required to adhere to the logic of its own tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.554" offset="4151662">Now, it has in its very basis an assumption that both domicile and business situs are contributing factors in the benefits and protections that a State can provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.504" offset="4203489">What it does, however, is it... it doesn't operate in consistency with that, with that theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.779" offset="4224596">To the extent it taxes all of a domicile, all intangibles owned by a domicile, its theory is the domicile is the entire contributing factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.816" offset="4268691">At the same time it is taxing some other domiciles, some other... a person domiciled in another State, based on business situs, which contradicts the very theory of the domicile tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.202" offset="4310278">So either it's... either it's domicile contributing everything, or they both contribute something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.215" offset="4326265">If they both contribute something, then the State ought not be allowed to tax business situs, on a business situs basis, in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.671" offset="4352074">It ought to recognize that there is somebody else contributing to the value of that intangible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.213" offset="4366284">So we think that the statute is inherently defective for exactly the same reasons that the Armco statute was defective and that the Tyler Pipe statute was defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.161" offset="4406095">The State argues... we think, Justice Stevens, that our situation is utterly indistinguishable from that in Armco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.735" offset="4432427">The fact that there were slightly different labels on the tax... that is, there is a manufacturing tax and a, and a wholesaling tax... made no difference, because the taxes were basically the same... operated the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.623" offset="4479969">And for the out-of-state manufacturer, he faced a wholesaling tax from which his local competitor was exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.617" offset="4503898">Now, the answer to that during the debate in the Court, presumably, and certainly the arguments in brief, was that well, that's true, but the manufacturer... the local manufacturer's paying a higher tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.575" offset="4547783">And it's really the same tax for the goods sold in West Virginia, the local manufacturer is paying not only what the outsider is, but actually more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.962" offset="4585295">And the Court said that was not an answer to that, that in effect there was an internal inconsistency that required... that required or subjected the out-of-state manufacturers to risks of double taxation that the local manufacturer did not have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.363" offset="4642869">That problem could have been solved in some respects the same way that your question suggested earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.047" offset="4669618">That is West Virginia could have said we are going to abandon our local manufacturing tax and we're going to subject our local manufacturers to the same tax that the out-of-staters are subjected to, and the out-of-state manufacturer would have been left in the same position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.917" offset="4729073">Those are just options for solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.909" offset="4737119">But the fact is that right now we are faced with a statute that leaves us exposed to risks that local companies are not exposed to, and that is, for reasons that we think are sound, incompatible with the... at least the recent Court's decisions on internal consistency.</text>

          <turn speaker="h_bartow_farr_iii" startTime="1175.357" stopTime="1313.829">
            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="1175.357" offset="4822905">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.194" offset="4878180">Ford in this case has used the internal consistency test to make two challenges in its brief to Florida's intangible taxes, one based on the situs tax alone, and one to the situs tax combined with the domiciliary tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.785" offset="4940560">Ford has not pressed the first argument here this morning, and we, I believe, have answered it fully in our brief by pointing out that there is no internal consistency problem resulting from the situs test itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.324" offset="4990715">So I would like to move directly to the second point, which is the combination of the situs and the domiciliary tax, and set out, if I may, just briefly at the beginning, what our position is on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.991" offset="5033452">Simply put, it is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.212" offset="5046304">That the Court shouldn't use the internal consistency test to strike down a taxing scheme when the hypothetical tax is based on domicile, and so the taxes of only one other State are likely to be at issue, and when a relatively simply factual inquiry shows that the taxpayer in fact paid only one tax on its property, just like its local competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.913" offset="5153093">The situation typically in which the Court has used the internal consistency test, as the Court has noted in using it, have been cases where when one hypothesizes the use of the... of a particular tax, one might conceivably be looking to cumulative taxation by 49 other States on the same basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.676" offset="5248178">That is simply not a situation that arises in the case of the tax based on domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.532" offset="5271584">In that kind of situation we know in advance that there is likely to be only one other State that is asserting taxing jurisdiction, and you do not have the same kind of impractical inquiry that you would have with manufacturing taxes and selling taxes, which could be levied for a particular taxpayer by a number of different States, when the basis of the hypothetical tax is, as it is in this case, simply domicile.</text>

            <text syncTime="1313.829" offset="5376805">Well, I think... I suppose you would argue then if Michigan had exactly the same scheme as Florida, that both... both States' tax laws would be valid?</text>

            <text syncTime="1325.995" offset="5425393">Well, we would in fact make such an argument based on the Due Process Clause cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1339.157" offset="5478056">--That there is an additional basis for taxation provided by domicile, as the Court has recognized, that goes beyond the usual situs basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.381" offset="5507000">But that is not the necessary part of the argument I'm making here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.633" offset="5519956">What I'm saying here is that it is a very simple question to look and see whether in fact Michigan had this tax, and very easy to see that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.680" offset="5560185">So in fact, when we move away from the hypothetical and move to actual practical considerations, it is absolutely clear that Ford paid only one tax on its Florida intangibles.</text>

            <text syncTime="1408.964" offset="5757253">It may be possible for using the internal consistency test to essentially litigate the double taxation or discrimination against another taxpayer from another State, which is what Ford is trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.934" offset="5809184">What we're saying is that where you don't have the kind of difficult factual inquiry that is likely to arise in other settings, there is no reason to move past Ford's particular situation, which shows that it did not pay a domiciliary tax, and thus paid a single tax only.</text>

            <text syncTime="1507.287" offset="6150552">So that a statute that has essentially what might be argued to be a logical inconsistency but causes no harm to a particular taxpayer should not be struck down with regard to that taxpayer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1523.389" offset="6215022">Well, there are certainly examples where the Court has said, for example in Northwestern States Cement, which is 358 U.S., the Court says we are not going to look at a hypothetical claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.087" offset="6261834">There is no actual double taxation in this case, therefore we will no go on and address the question of whether there is a hypothetical problem with the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.833" offset="6292763">It seems to me that is a perfectly sound basis where the inquiry as to the particular taxpayer can be made relatively straightforwardly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.029" offset="6329543">And I think this is an obvious example of that kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.860" offset="6344903">Taking for a moment the inquiry that I am proposing, which, as I say, departs somewhat from the idea of using hypothetical taxing burdens and looking at actual burdens, what... what do we see in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.420" offset="6403104">As I have said, we see that Ford has not paid a domiciliary tax to Michigan, and indeed hasn't paid one to Delaware either, should that be the possible alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.677" offset="6440198">When you look at what Ford really puts most of its emphasis on, you turn to the question of what are the risks of double taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.532" offset="6475515">And there concededly is language in the Court's opinion that talk about risk as part of Commerce Clause analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.329" offset="6506758">But I would like to suggest that it's worth taking a hard look in a case like this at what the risks really are, because risks are very easy to exaggerate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.946" offset="6545210">What do we know about the risk that Ford faced in Michigan, its domicile State, in 1980, 1981, and 1982, which are the years, the taxing years that are in question here?</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.777" offset="6592544">The first thing we know about them is that in fact the risk of a domiciliary tax didn't materialize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.302" offset="6618667">Michigan did not impose the tax during those years in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.105" offset="6633818">Second, and more importantly, we know that the risk, at best, because of the nature of Ford's argument, is simply a marginal risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.593" offset="6675822">Ford has based its argument here solely on the internal consistency clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.767" offset="6692541">Yet Ford concedes, as it has to, that if in those years Michigan had had a domiciliary tax and Ford... excuse me, and Florida had had a situs tax, so long as Florida didn't itself have a domiciliary tax, the two statutes together would meet the internal consistency test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.622" offset="6771953">So what that leaves Ford with when it talks about risks is essentially an incremental risk, the idea that Michigan wouldn't tax its domiciliary corporations on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.288" offset="6822631">It would only do so essentially in sort of a copy cat fashion, because Florida has done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.362" offset="6846872">And even there, I might suggest, that if Michigan were to consider a domiciliary tax, what you don't have in this case is what you have in so many Commerce Clause cases, the difficulty of an out-of-state corporation facing taxing decisions by a State in which it's not located.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.486" offset="6923359">We are talking about the possibility of a tax imposed by Ford's own domicile, where Ford presumably has substantial political power.</text>

            <text syncTime="2002.133" offset="8130007">And one question I suppose I would raise here is, for all their talk about multiple burdens and discrimination and lack of allocation, is there any reasonable likelihood that in 1980, 1981, or 1982 Ford would have changed places with the Florida domiciliary corporations insofar as taxes on intangibles were concerned?</text>

            <text syncTime="2074.702" offset="8420280">In Tyler Pipe this Court pointed out that any problem with internal consistency in that case could be solved for out-of-state manufacturers by providing a credit against the out-of-state tax on the tax levied by the State of Washington in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.301" offset="8486631">Assuming that Florida could do the same thing here, and we don't see any reason why they couldn't simply to achieve the consistency that Florida is talking about, ultimately that credit would do Ford no good whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.131" offset="8545981">It has nothing in fact to credit from its domiciliary State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.667" offset="8568133">So to the extent that there is a superficial difference because a Florida corporation arguably gets a credit against one tax and only has to pay once, even if Florida applied exactly the same rule to Ford, there would be no difference whatsoever in the judgment that is in front of the Court at this point, the judgment that says they owe the taxes for 1980, 1981, and 1982.</text>

            <text syncTime="2144.198" offset="8698222">Let me just start where Mr. Farr left off on credits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.395" offset="8731032">This is an issue that was discussed as well in Tyler Pipe, in which the Court specifically said that credits might be a solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.732" offset="8772410">And in fact the... the complaining parties in Tyler Pipe, if a credit had been provided, would have likewise, at least prospectively, been arguably no better off than they were before they came to Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.673" offset="8820162">On the question of refunds, we have not conceded anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.896" offset="8829044">That's not an issue that's here at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.429" offset="8843150">It's a matter for remedy that the Court has spelled out, and the contours of which from a constitutional standpoint the Court has spelled out recently in McKesson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.586" offset="8879826">We are not in a refund posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.318" offset="8886722">We're here under an assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.889" offset="8896962">We have not paid the tax, we have posted a bond for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.542" offset="8911591">We have paid a portion of the tax, and we are not suing for refund of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.974" offset="8925383">So we are not even in a refund posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.556" offset="8931653">Insofar as a retroactive or retrospective remedy, we think it's something that ought to be dealt with by the Florida courts, and in fact the Florida courts have at least some cases suggesting that a taxpayer is not required to pay a tax under a statute declared unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2240.480" offset="9083372">--Well, I think to a certain extent that may be, that may be right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.901" offset="9093089">And it, it reminds me, Justice Kennedy, of a point that I believe was in Justice Stevens' concurring opinion in the Goldberg case, which is that the fact that one State cedes or declines to adopt a tax doesn't mean that somebody else can take that State's share.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.683" offset="9156201">I think that in... there are about half of the States that, at least as we have identified in a rough survey, that have some form of intangible taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.871" offset="9196952">About five or six of them, or so, look pretty much like Florida's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.555" offset="9219627">They have a... looks on the face of it at least to be an internal inconsistency, taxing both on the basis of domicile and on the basis of... or alternatively on the basis of business situs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.211" offset="9258288">A couple of them choose one or the other, and then there are a large category that is just not decipherable in the face of the statute what they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.957" offset="9293292">But clearly, intangible values are taxed elsewhere, and it may be that Michigan chooses to require its domiciliaries to pay their share of State and local services that are provided within the State to domiciliaries in some other form, rather than an intangible property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.992" offset="9373435">Clearly this is not a free ride for Ford Motor Credit Company, and it ought not to be a... an opening, in effect, in the line for Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.308" offset="9410634">I... now... Mr. Farr seems to have said something that was also in the brief that I just want to address briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.873" offset="9444907">The notion that the Court's decisions in the 1940's, late 1930's and 1940's, on due process grounds bear on the issue here, we think is really quite far fetched.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.232" offset="9494330">Those cases were due process cases where the issue was one issue only, namely did a nondomiciliary State have the jurisdiction to tax property owned by... that was in the State but that was not owned by one of its own domiciliaries, and the answer to that question was yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.966" offset="9573324">There was never any consideration in those cases about multiple taxation, because the issue was a due process issue, and not an interstate... impeding of interstate commerce issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.102" offset="9609896">The fact is that the one time when the author of the key opinion, Chief Justice Stone, addressed the issue, he specifically said, and we quoted this in our reply brief, which I am not finding right now, this was in his dissenting opinion in Northwest Airlines at 332 U.S. He said, in response really to an argument that Mr. Farr has made, that yes, domicile can be important and it can give a basis for State taxation of intangibles that might otherwise not be available in the case of tangible property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.866" offset="9752942">But then he goes on to say that the taxation of intangibles of interstate companies is subject to the rule of apportionment, wherever the tax--</text>

            <text syncTime="2553.487" offset="10335369">Now, Mr. Farr said that the risk that we face would... we would still face even if, even if the State abandoned its domicile tax, as he suggested, and left in place simply a business situs tax applicable to everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.620" offset="10407884">And that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.521" offset="10415512">We would face a risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.713" offset="10420319">It would be a slightly different risk, and while it would look the same, it would offer different opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.267" offset="10438500">At least we would have an opportunity, or a company with a domicile outside the State would have an opportunity to change domiciles if its own domicile State adopted a domiciliary tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.152" offset="10474027">In that event it would pay no tax in Florida, because Florida doesn't have a domicile tax, and it would pay no tax in the State it used to be domiciled in because it has no business situs tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.978" offset="10509344">Furthermore, firms generally, although individual firms might face risks and might be hurt, firms generally, on balance, operating in interstate commerce would fare about as well as those operating in intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.367" offset="10558872">Because, as I say, while some might ultimately have to pay two taxes, others will get away with paying none.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.761" offset="10584472">And finally, while there... it is true that there is a limit beyond which the Court can't go, consistent with principles of federalism, we cannot tell Florida that it cannot adopt a... an internally consistent tax on the basis of business situs or domicile simply because Michigan chooses to adopt a different internally consistent tax on a different basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.036" offset="10665556">That's the irreducible minimum required by principles of federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.677" offset="10680185">But we can tell Florida that it cannot adopt an internally inconsistent statute that enhances the risks beyond those that are the minimum necessary to preserve federalist principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.786" offset="10724593">One final comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.378" offset="10734938">We have been... the Court has been debating questions of internal consistency now actively for almost a decade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.533" offset="10763568">Almost every argument that has been presented in the briefs here has been thoroughly debated in the prior decisions of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.468" offset="10795333">There is no distinction, no distinction that we can see in principle between applying the test here and applying the test in the cases that have already been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.884" offset="10828978">To whatever extent there is any difference, we think it's an easier case here, because we are dealing with a property tax, where assets have one value, much like income does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.222" offset="10862311">But in any event, it's time for some stability in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.152" offset="10878089">It's an issue that is constantly in play.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.776" offset="10892508">And the Court has now decided five cases since 1983 in which it has indicated that internal consistency is a special test to screen for defective State taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.286" offset="10938588">It has been a hotly debated issue, but it is now, I think, time to settle it and leave it in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.138" offset="10958023">States ought to begin to deal with this test, which is not difficult for them to apply, is not onerous with respect to their options, and which ought to be dealt with by the States that way rather than as another opportunity for litigating Commerce Clause issues.</text>
