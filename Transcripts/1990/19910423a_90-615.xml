            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="134790">We'll hear argument now in No. 90-615, Rafael Peretz against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.338" offset="168122">Mr. Rudin.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joel B. Rudin</label>
            <text syncTime="9.477" offset="172615">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.641" offset="189334">As in the case of Gomez against United States, the critical jury selection stage of petitioner's felony trial was conducted by a magistrate from whom Congress had withheld the authority to preside.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.207" offset="235518">The Solicitor General concedes that this was error.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.500" offset="248788">The principal issue about which the parties disagree is whether or not the issue was preserved for this Court's review despite counsel's purported consent on petitioner's behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.385" offset="288286">We say the issue was preserved because the defect was not subject to waiver, and that if it was subject to waiver the requisite statutory or constitutional waiver standard was not met.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.624" offset="337187">The framers gave Congress exclusive power to create the inferior tribunals, or tribunals inferior to this Court, to invest these tribunals with jurisdiction, to authorize the appointment of officers to exercise that jurisdiction, and to allocate or to distribute power to be exercised by these officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.165" offset="411374">The framers gave Congress the exclusive power to adjust the allocation of jurisdiction in the lower Federal courts to meet changing societal needs, so long as the adjustment was within the constraints of article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.555" offset="468948">The magistrates act was an attempt by Congress to do just that, to meet the litigation explosion of the latter part of the 20th century by creating the new office of magistrate, by defining its jurisdiction powers and duties, and then, as this Court pointed out in Gomez, by carefully circumscribing magistrates' trial jurisdiction in the interest of policy as well as constitutional constraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.200" offset="563512">Congress gave magistrates consent trial jurisdiction in the area of misdemeanor and petty offense trials and for civil trials, but withheld consent trial jurisdiction for magistrates in felony cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.759" offset="613771">And the Solicitor General concedes that this withholding applies to the critical voir dire stage of a felony trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.945" offset="642506">A district court may not override Congress' policy judgment to withhold this jurisdiction from magistrates, and petitioner could not consent to consent trial jurisdiction being exercised when Congress had withheld such trial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.862" offset="702170">And in our view any such consent would be a nullity, and therefore counsel's waiver was a nullity and could not prevent petitioner from raising the defect on appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="152.461" offset="744592">Your Honor, it was not an effective waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.202" offset="755564">It was... I am using the term a purported waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.954" offset="766535">It was a... it could not be an effective waiver for the reasons that I have just explained, and as I will go on later in my argument to explain, even if a waiver could be made in this area it would have to meet the standards set by Congress and by the Constitution in order for the waiver to forfeit petitioner's right to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.588" offset="841141">An officer's... the Glidden case, we believe, disposes of this case, at least on the question of whether or not the error may be reviewed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.673" offset="877399">In the Glidden case, in an opinion by Justice Harlan, the Court reached the merits of the petitioner's article III argument even though the court that delegated power to an officer, who arguably was not an article III officer, itself had subject matter jurisdiction.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joel B. Rudin</label>
            <text syncTime="207.697" offset="965484">Your Honor, that was an opinion by Justice Harlan for a plurality of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.941" offset="982516">It was an opinion joined by two other members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.911" offset="990352">But there were four other members of the Court who participated in the decision, two in a dissenting opinion and two in a plurality opinion, and none of them took issue with Justice Harlan's analysis of whether or not the error could be reviewed by the Court, even though the petitioners had not objected in the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.090" offset="1051061">In the Glidden case there were two matters that were consolidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.773" offset="1069869">One case involved a criminal trial in the district court in the District of Columbia in which a judge from the court of customs and patent appeals presided.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.699" offset="1105500">And the petitioner argued that that judge was not an article III judge and therefore, consistent with the Constitution, could not preside.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.874" offset="1134235">The other case involved an appeal to the court of appeals in the Second Circuit in which one of the three judges who was designated to preside by the chief justice of the United States and by the chief judge of the court of appeals of the Second Circuit was a court of claims judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.084" offset="1191077">And again, petitioner argued that that judge did not have jurisdiction to preside under article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.967" offset="1214588">Justice Harlan in his opinion treated this defect as a nonwaivable jurisdictional type defect because it was necessary to do so to permit this Court to protect institutional interests that were far broader than the narrow interests of an individual litigant.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="288.049" offset="1286894">But in order to make this case parallel to that you would have to establish that there was not only a violation of the statute here, but a violation of article III.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="299.016" offset="1330780">And so far all you have said is that this was not in accordance with the statutory requirements.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joel B. Rudin</label>
            <text syncTime="303.280" offset="1347812">--Your Honor, I would respectfully disagree with the premise of Your Honor's question because it... my understanding of article III is that for an officer to exercise judicial authority under article III there need not only be inherent authority for Congress to confer the jurisdiction, but Congress in fact has to then confer the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.042" offset="1418865">In the Schor case and all the other cases in which this Court has discussed article III issues and the exercise of power by nonarticle III officers or the exercise of judicial power by adjuncts, in every single one of those cases the power was exercised pursuant to a statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.101" offset="1479156">It's well established--</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="338.443" offset="1488560">It's pursuant to a statutory scheme that violated article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.434" offset="1504442">But here you have a statutory scheme which you are not asserting violates article III, or you haven't asserted it so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.487" offset="1528684">Assuming that the statutory scheme is in compliance with article III, all you have is a violation of the statute, and that is not comparable to what was the problem in Glidden.</text>

            <text syncTime="357.894" offset="1566300">--Well, Your Honor, we certainly have argued in our brief and I am prepared to argue this morning that there was an inherent violation of article III, that had Congress authorized this function to be exercised, that it would have violated article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.024" offset="1618859">But Congress did not even authorize the function to be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.725" offset="1629621">And this Court has said over and over and over again that there is no authority or jurisdiction for an officer to exercise the judicial power of the United States in an article III setting unless Congress has authorized that exercise of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.894" offset="1686359">That was true in the Schor case.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.195" offset="1695554">In the Schor case the petitioner, or the litigant, invited an article I tribunal before the CFTC to exercise jurisdiction over his... that petitioner's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.164" offset="1739440">And even though petitioner had invited the tribunal to exercise that jurisdiction, this Court still reached the merits of the petitioner's structural article III claim, even though it could be said that petitioner had invited the jurisdictional error.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.352" offset="1792103">There is simply no such thing as invited jurisdictional error.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.214" offset="1803597">The same rule was applied in the Owen Equipment and Erection Company against Kroeger case, which is not in my brief, 437 U.S. 365.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.600" offset="1833167">There the petitioner had concealed his citizenship at the trial court level, and thereby concealed from the district court that there was a lack of diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.324" offset="1868067">And on appeal the petitioner was permitted to raise lack of diversity before this Court, and this Court dismissed the civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.138" offset="1895339">The same result in American Fire and Casualty Company against Finn, 341 U.S. 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.272" offset="1915819">The petitioner in that case asked the district court to remove an action that had been brought in the State court under the statutory removal jurisdiction established by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.747" offset="1953748">The district court did remove the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.580" offset="1961063">And then on appeal to this Court the petitioner successfully argued that that removal jurisdiction had been erroneously exercised because it exceeded what Congress had authorized.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="465.777" stopTime="472.160">
            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="465.777" offset="1997843">Of course those cases deal with subject matter jurisdiction, and I really don't think yours does.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joel_b_rudin" startTime="472.160" stopTime="718.290">
            <label>Mr. Joel B. Rudin</label>
            <text syncTime="472.160" offset="2023339">Well, Your Honor, I suppose that there can be a distinction made between whether or not the court that delegates the authority has subject matter jurisdiction, and the jurisdiction or the authority of the officer who actually exercises the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.879" offset="2078300">In this case the Government correctly concedes that the court that purported to delegate its jurisdiction did not have the authority to make that delegation, and Congress prohibited the district courts from making this type of delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.539" offset="2136919">But it seems to me that it's significant as to whether or not the officer who exercises the jurisdiction, which is really the matter that we should be concerned with, who actually exercises the jurisdiction, in this case that officer, the magistrate, did not have jurisdiction, did not have power given to him by Congress to preside over the subject matter of a felony trial or a critical stage of that trial, and that being voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.035" offset="2234930">In the Northern Pipeline case an argument was made that bankruptcy judges were adjuncts of the district court, and that it was the district court that had subject matter jurisdiction, and the bankruptcy judges derived jurisdiction from the jurisdiction that the district courts had.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.835" offset="2294072">And this Court, in a plurality opinion, termed that a facade... that the jurisdictional grant was a facade because the officer who actually exercised the jurisdiction was not in power to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.372" offset="2340256">And that, of course, is what happened in Glidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.442" offset="2348511">In the Glidden case the district court that sat at a criminal trial and the court of appeals which sat at an appeal of a civil trial, clearly those two courts had subject matter jurisdiction, but the officer who actually exercised the jurisdiction did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.042" offset="2406921">And Justice Harlan felt that that was akin to a jurisdictional error or at least should be treated by the Court as a jurisdictional-type error so that the Court could reach the truly important interest, which was not whether or not an individual litigant was deserving of a new trial or whether or not he somehow could be blamed for not having made an explicit objection, but rather to protect the proper administration of judicial business, which is this Court's obligation in the Federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.853" offset="2530114">That is the way Justice Harlan put it.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.863" offset="2538160">And also to protect the constitutional plan of checks and balances and separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.496" offset="2556759">If the error that occurred to this case... that occurred in this case is treated as waivable, and therefore this Court does not reach the merits of the error which the Government concedes, then there will be no change in the law in the Second and the Third Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.155" offset="2607332">Both those circuits have held that the magistrate does have power under the additional dutie clause, despite this Court's analysis in Gomez, to preside at voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.269" offset="2639828">As recently as within the last 6 months a judge in the Eastern District of New York attempted, with the defendant's consent that he asked for and obtained, to delegate voir dire to a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.767" offset="2681833">And the Government had to go to the Second Circuit in In Re Sayeedi and ask the Second Circuit to grant the writ of mandamus to prevent the judge from doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.562" offset="2712971">And I would submit that the obvious reason the judge did... the Government did that was that they were concerned that built-in reversible error would occur.</text>

            <text syncTime="1036.257" offset="4279796">That's why the... it seems to me that that's why the Raddatz case focused on the distinction between the interest at stake in a pretrial suppression hearing, where the ultimate question of truth or innocence is not involved, and the trial itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.374" offset="4328279">That was the reason, I believe, why Justice Marshall in Raddatz dissented, because Justice Marshall did not accept that distinction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1103.222" offset="4547603">In the Raddatz case the Court found that the procedure was sufficient because it provided for a very careful review procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1403.049" offset="5746937">--Yes, but the determination of whether or not to admit expert testimony, the district judge is afforded wide discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.675" offset="5773477">And my point is only that one of the reasons is that he is aware of everything that has gone on, including the composition of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.020" offset="5802839">Certainly if there is a juror disqualification question that arises it is necessary that he be aware of these... the qualities of specific jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.945" offset="5838470">As to the question of waiverability, as viewing this as a procedural right, we believe that this is akin... the analysis should be akin to the analysis that has been applied to the requirement under rule 31(a) for a unanimous verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.084" offset="5891028">Justice Kennedy in the Lopez case in the Ninth Circuit, in a holding that has been joined by six out of seven circuits, held that the right to a unanimous verdict is simply not waivable under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.333" offset="5944109">It is clear that Congress may fix standards for waiverability that control whether or not a right can be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.508" offset="5968769">That reasoning applies to the magistrates act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.358" offset="5984129">Congress permitted the right to trial before a district court to be waived in civil and misdemeanor and petty offense cases, but not in felony cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.184" offset="6019446">Congress... and that is one of the main points relied on in the Lopez case and the other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.520" offset="6048808">Congress was concerned, with the waiver of a unanimous verdict requirement... the inherent coercion of a request from a district judge during the midst of jury deliberations, and did not want to put a defendant in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.917" offset="6094366">Well, we submit that that was the same concern that Congress had with waiver in the magistrates context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.511" offset="6116831">Congress in the civil consent part of the act explicitly required as a matter of statutory language that the clerk put the question to the litigant, not the judge, because of the inherent coerciveness of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.246" offset="6159672">And in the criminal context required a knowing, written, intelligent, voluntary waiver on the record, also to ensure voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.853" offset="6198124">And that is another reason why Congress, we submit, made this right nonwaivable for felonies, because the interests at stake in a felony trial are simply far greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.229" offset="6231665">Finally, we believe that the critical issue here is whether or not this issue was preserved for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.666" offset="6277432">If the issue was preserved for review because an injection was not required, or because a consent would be ineffective, or because a waiver had to meet a standard set by Congress or the Constitution that was not met in this case, then there is no reason to turn to plain error analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.248" offset="6343678">Plain error analysis only applies where an issue is not preserved for review because of a failure to meet the contemporaneous objection requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.992" offset="6374712">In the Gomez case this Court held that this error is not subject to harmless error analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.147" offset="6395296">And therefore if the Court reaches the merits in this case, as we submit that it should, it must reverse the conviction.</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="1576.137" offset="6439286">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.049" offset="6450885">Let me begin very briefly by addressing the point raised near the end of the argument with respect to rule 31 and the nonwaivability of unanimous jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.308" offset="6499995">The Court in Lopez, through Justice Kennedy sitting as a circuit justice... judge... held that the rule itself, viewing it to the language and the legislative history of the rule, indicated that a unanimous jury was nonwaivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.650" offset="6581288">That was a construction of the rule, and obviously Congress or this Court, through its rule... the promulgation of the rules... can decide that a particular error will be nonwaivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.388" offset="6628308">If it says so in effect or in plain language, that's the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.671" offset="6649415">This case does not involve a congressional declaration that a particular error is nonwaivable, and therefore we have to look at more general principles... the contemporaneous objection rule, the invited error doctrine... and ask whether in this particular case there is anything that takes this case and like cases out of those doctrines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.416" offset="6744397">Now, it's important to emphasize, I think, at the outset that this case involves a very narrow question of remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.391" offset="6776266">This is a case in which it is true, as we see it, that there was an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.136" offset="6795283">But the question is what is the consequence of the error in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.859" offset="6818166">Is it... does it require reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.580" offset="6825063">And we submit that there should be very few case where the law will say that... or will recognize a defendant coming in and saying yes, I asked for a particular procedure, yes, I got the procedure that I asked for, but no, I wasn't entitled to it and therefore please reverse my conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.802" offset="6901967">In our view that's what this case comes down to, and we have to ask the question is there some reason that we are required to reverse in this case, in spite of the defendant's having asked for the procedure, precisely the procedure that he got.</text>

            <text syncTime="1769.682" offset="7213451">What's happened is there has been a violation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.984" offset="7226721">The district judge, to assign a jury selection to a magistrate, if this Court were to hold that that is a violation of the law, as we believe it is, would have to say so what, I am going to assign it to a magistrate anyway... even though I know it's a violation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.983" offset="7282623">And we submit that isn't something that district judges are going to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.965" offset="7294640">I think they recognize the difference between something that is error and may not be done, and something that is authorized to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.600" offset="7329121">And in effect I'd call Your Honors' attention to the Ford case, which was the en banc Fifth Circuit case in which this issue was specifically addressed in the majority which held that, number one, the jury selection could not be referred to a magistrate, but number two, found that it was not plain error in that case because the matter was not raised by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.816" offset="7418042">And there's a footnote at the end of the en banc majority's opinion in which the court said we assume confidently that district judges will not simply disregard our holding and assign things to the magistrates, even though there may be consent to the doing of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.897" offset="7478333">I would... I think there's an analogy, if I may, with a case a few years ago from this Court, Parker against Randolf, which held that a... the introduction, I believe, of cross-corroborating confessions was error but it was always harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.717" offset="7545624">Now, you could say, of course, well, district judges could simply introduce... allow that kind of evidence to come in because it will always be regarded as harmless error and never, therefore never result in reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.734" offset="7585644">But the answer to that, it seems to me, is that it is the obligation of the district court to follow the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.058" offset="7606960">We can assume the district courts will follow the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.359" offset="7616155">And the fact that the consequence will not be reversal of the conviction doesn't mean the district judges will disregard their obligations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1933.480" offset="7868707">We submit there are three possible exceptions, and we suggest that none of them applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.423" offset="7888455">First, the plain error doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.203" offset="7895561">Second, the doctrine which petitioner relies on most heavily, of jurisdictional nonwaivable error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.999" offset="7930774">And third, a nonwaivable article III error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.532" offset="7944880">Now, first with respect to plain error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.113" offset="7955224">Plain error requires a showing that there has been essentially a miscarriage of justice, that there has been something that has gone terribly wrong, an egregious error in the proceedings that result in great prejudice to the defense, going to the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.245" offset="8023770">This case simply does not have any element of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.877" offset="8034219">It is true that this Court in Gomez held that the Court would not recognize the harmless error doctrine in respect to magistrate conducting voir dire, but that is a very different matter from saying that plain error is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.448" offset="8108511">This Court demonstrated that distinction, I think, in the grand jury context when, in Vasquez against Hillery, the Court held that you could not have a harmless error doctrine with respect to claims of the unlawful exclusion of persons on the basis of race from a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.534" offset="8200880">But that did not override this Court's prior decisions that such an error was not plain error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.750" offset="8233690">The distinction, it seems to us, is clear and is based on the very limited nature of a plain error, which is that it has to go to the merits of the case or somehow reflect on the integrity and public reputation of judicial proceedings, which this surely does not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2236.027" offset="9078803">Well, again, of course the word jurisdiction is a murky term, but I think what the Court has said in this area is that jurisdiction, when there is jurisdictional error that means that the district judge, there is no subject matter jurisdiction, the district judge does not have authority with respect to a particular class of cases to enter a binding judgment with respect to the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.350" offset="9160096">That clearly is not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.523" offset="9168873">Here there is no question that there was subject jurisdiction in this case in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.364" offset="9184233">The only question is did the district court make a mistake in assigning this particular part of the case, this particular function, to an officer of the court who should not have had that assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.232" offset="9231672">This has nothing to do with jurisdiction in the traditional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.344" offset="9244106">It's a question of authority of that officer and the permissibility of the assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.307" offset="9259988">For that reason this case, in our view, is no different from what it would have been had the district judge, with respect to jurisdiction now, had the district judge simply said I want to assign the jury selection to the judge in the chambers next door, who is not busy right now, and I have two jury trials going.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.849" offset="9338147">The parties fail to raise the objection, which would be, I think, a valid objection under the rule that this does not constitute a proper assignment, and that would, I think, be clearly waivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.038" offset="9394885">There is no question, in our view, that that wouldn't be a jurisdictional defect if the judge from the chambers next door came in and selected the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.225" offset="9427590">Even though, of course, as respondent... or, excuse me, petitioner contends, that judge would be viewing all of the prospective jurors and wouldn't have whatever advantages there might accrue to the judges, the trial judge's exposure to the jury during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.337" offset="9500106">But nonetheless, that is not a jurisdictional defect, we say.</text>

            <text syncTime="2362.980" offset="9586623">And I think that the answer to that question is compelled by the answer that this Court has not addressed but the lower courts have uniformly agreed, I think 12 circuits have addressed the question, which is that civil cases and misdemeanor trials, which are authorized to be assigned to magistrates by the statute, can constitutionally be assigned to magistrates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.055" offset="9674917">I don't think that you can find a distinction in article III or in questions of jurisdiction between misdemeanors and felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.958" offset="9702607">Sure, felonies are more important to the parties typically than misdemeanors and often than civil cases, but there is no article III basis for that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.004" offset="9738761">And we think there is no basis in jurisdictional concepts for that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.269" offset="9755792">So, yes, we would say that, certainly with consent, reference to a magistrate for a felony trial would be appropriate, given especially all of the protections that are available by way of the magistrate's position within the judicial branch as an inferior officer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2552.734" offset="10345637">I think they... and let me see if I can explain the way we see the distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.467" offset="10364654">We say that what Gomez said was that the additional duties clause in particular of the magistrates act does not include voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.114" offset="10399241">Now, we further say that the parties agreeing consent does not make it so, does not change what the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.097" offset="10435081">The statute says voir dire simply isn't included within the additional duties that the statute assigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.032" offset="10458904">But that is very different from saying that you then must apply plain error to the statutory violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.778" offset="10489833">Yes, the statute is violated, but no, you don't automatically get relief simply by virtue of a violation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.612" offset="10521180">And in fact we think there will be very few cases in which you will get relief if you don't object.</text>

            <text syncTime="2603.638" offset="10549288">The analogy, I suppose, would be if there were a statute saying you cannot stipulate as to any given line of evidence, and the parties stipulated that certain evidence could be introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.404" offset="10592338">I suppose, that's the only example I can think of.</text>

            <text syncTime="2616.424" offset="10600383">Well, except that I think our case is stronger, because it's not that Congress said you may not assign jury selection to a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.510" offset="10628805">What Congress simply left out of the additional duties clause, as that clause was construed by this Court in Gomez, the... it simply failed to include jury selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.908" offset="10670392">Now, it would be a somewhat different case, we think, if Congress had said, number one, you can do the following additional duties but you'd better not do jury selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.754" offset="10705709">You may not do jury selection in misdemeanor or felony cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.214" offset="10719606">That's not what the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.357" offset="10728174">Now, I think, moving on to the article III point, there we rely on two lines of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.084" offset="10771120">First those cases such as Raddatz and Crowell, in which the Court has said that an adjunct to a district court can perform services in aid of the district judge as long as the district judge maintains control of the proceedings, as long as the essential attributes of judicial power are preserved in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.417" offset="10860354">Now, and the second line of cases is a case illustrated by the Schor case, in which the Court has attached great weight to the presence of consent with respect to the waiver of the individual component of the article III right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.408" offset="10924406">It's important, I think, in focusing on the article III claim to see just exactly what it is we have here with respect to a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.647" offset="10965366">We have an officer who, it was appointed by the district court, who is removable by the district court, who is supervised in everything that he or she does by the district court, who's subject to the district court's appointment in the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.017" offset="11038823">The district court does not have, by law or practice or rule, have to assign the magistrate to a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.173" offset="11067453">And the district court may withdraw from the magistrate the reference at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.703" offset="11085530">The magistrate's work, moreover, is subject to whatever degree of review the district court can perform, upon the party's request, if they should request it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.275" offset="11147806">In this case, and I think that this is a very important point, in this particular case there was no request for a review, and there's a good reason, because this jury selection procedure was clean as a whistle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.262" offset="11191796">It's not surprising that there was no request for review because frankly there was nothing to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.587" offset="11213112">The only one point on which the magistrate ruled against the defendant, in a manner of speaking, by excusing someone that the defendant preferred not to have excused, was a case which, as we discuss in our brief, was very clearly somebody that was properly challenged for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.127" offset="11287195">And the defendant didn't come to the district court and say Your Honor, this juror should not have been challenged for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.431" offset="11312481">This was, there was no basis for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.773" offset="11317810">He acquiesced, in effect, in the magistrate's decision with respect to that juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.497" offset="11340694">And I might say, there were something like eight other decisions that the magistrate made which went against the Government and in favor of the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.911" offset="11370369">So that it's not surprising that the defense, number one, wanted to have a magistrate select the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.244" offset="11391685">The defense might very well have concluded that they were better off with the magistrate than they would have been with a district judge, who might have been a little less patient and asked a few fewer questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3292.798" offset="13305938">First of all, following up on Justice Kennedy's question, if the defect that occurred in this case was not waivable, then we submit that no objection was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.324" offset="13340001">And if no objection was required, then the Court cannot punish this defendant for not having made an objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.968" offset="13362571">Second of all, Mr. Bryson has left out of his analysis a critical exception to the plain error rule, and that exception is that where Congress fixes the waiver standard, whether it be by the Johnson v. Zerbst knowing, intelligent, and voluntary standard or that it be not waivable at all, the Court cannot require the defendant to object.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.971" offset="13438640">Again, the Court cannot punish the defendant for not, for failing to object when the right that's involved is such an important structural right that Congress has required either that it not be waivable or that any waiver by the defendant meet the Johnson v. Zerbst standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.599" offset="13493183">We submit that in this case, this case can be decided as a matter of statutory construction and the constitutional issues that have been raised this morning can be avoided.</text>

            <text syncTime="3397.558" offset="13724942">On the other hand, Congress can be paternalistic and can say that the right is so important, the right to trial before a proper judge or trial before the proper entity, as the Court put it in Gomez, is so important that we're not going to permit a judge to ask a defendant whether or not he wants to waive that right, where the judge is the person who will be presiding at the balance of the trial and will be able to sentence the defendant upon conviction, as in this case, to life in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.102" offset="13815117">Mr. Peretz was charged with a mandatory 10 year offense where he was facing up to life in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.415" offset="13836432">Finally, the Government keeps on trying to trivialize the defect that occurred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.819" offset="13853987">The defect occurred involving what this Court in Gomez called a critical stage of trial, where the right to trial before a judge of competent jurisdiction attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.323" offset="13892021">This Court uses the term "critical", calls a right critical when it's not de minimis or not inconsequential.</text>
