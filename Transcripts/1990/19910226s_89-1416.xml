            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73982">The other case is No. 89-1416, Air Courier Conference of America versus American Postal Workers' Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.135" offset="110449">For more than a century, Congress has granted the United States Postal Service a monopoly on the carriage of letters.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.323" offset="139184">These laws are collectively known as the Private Express Statutes or PES.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.287" offset="163112">These statutes allow the Postal Service to suspend their provisions as to any mail route when a public interest so requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.257" offset="194981">In this case, the Postal Service asks acting pursuant to this authority issued a regulation authorizing a practice called international remailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.735" offset="236882">That practice allows the bypassing of the regular postal service and the use of private carriers to deposit directly with foreign postal services letters from the United States destined for foreign addressees.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.925" offset="293620">The respondent unions, representing employees of a Postal Service, sued in the District Court claiming that the record before the Postal Service was inadequate to support a finding that the regulation was in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.326" offset="347223">The District Court ruled against them, but the Court of Appeals held that the Unions had standing to assert this claim and that the suspension was not justified by the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.076" offset="390273">We hold and in an opinion filed today that the Unions do not have standing to challenge the Postal Service's suspension of the PES in order to permit international remailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.012" offset="429979">When Congress enacted the Private Express Statutes back in 1847, it was not concerned with protecting postal employment or furthering postal job opportunities.1</text>
            <text syncTime="101.562" offset="480134">Thus, the fact that postal workers might lose jobs as a result of the approval of international remailing is not sufficient to allow them to challenge the regulation here in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.379" offset="519422">We, therefore, reverse the Court of Appeals without reaching the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.097" offset="534364">Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justices Marshall and Blackmun have joined.</text>
