            <text syncTime="1302.696" offset="5347010">But we submit there are many other ways of looking at the issue as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.818" offset="5359549">For example, the issue of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.909" offset="5367908">When a newspaper makes a promise of confidentiality to a news source or makes a voluntary promise of any sort, does it then have the right to say that we're going to violate that promise because we have a First Amendment right to do that so?</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.376" offset="5421720">We submit that once that promise is voluntarily made, the newspaper has in effect waived the right to make any First Amendment claim of a right to violate the promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.174" offset="5461009">Otherwise, promises of newspapers or media organizations would be virtually worthless, not only to news source confidentiality but at any individuals or businesses that newspapers deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.392" offset="5513880">You had a similar type of situation in the Snepp case Justice Scalia mentioned where a person promised not to publish any information regarding his employment at the CIA without first getting the approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.914" offset="5579918">He broke the promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.282" offset="5585351">He claimed a First amendment right to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.866" offset="5595696">The court ruled that he couldn't do it... in fact, establish a constructive trust on all the profits from the publication in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.100" offset="5624640">Again... so in the other issues relating to this is whether newspapers should have the right to violate agreements, should be subject to the same law as applied to everyone else, every other individual or every other business who makes an agreement with another party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.603" offset="5698723">Should newspapers and media organizations who enter into such agreements willingly in exchange for other types... types of information they consider valuable... shouldn't they be subject to the same law as applies to everyone else who makes voluntary agreements without having a special... without being given a special First Amendment right to violate those agreements?</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.147" offset="5784822">Finally, in... in Branzburg v. Hayes, the journalist argue there that honoring promises of confidentiality were so important to First Amendment values as to require constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.569" offset="5854517">The court rejected that request at that point and ruled that these... the First Amendment was simply inapplicable to these types of agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.742" offset="5883252">This Court should not now accede to respond its demand to create a special First Amendment right to dishonor their agreements.</text>

            <text syncTime="3194.435" offset="12913952">But it might also be saying that the First Amendment, not in all circumstances but in some circumstances, prohibits the penalty for the contractual breach.</text>

            <label>Mr. Elliot C. Rothenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="3257.036" offset="13164414">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court again:</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.289" offset="13177371">Your Honors, I would like to make a couple of points on rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.911" offset="13191895">First regarding the issue of whether the decision below was based on the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.004" offset="13212271">We would submit that any fair reading indicates that in fact was based upon the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.938" offset="13235990">When you look at pages A-12 to A-14, you have such language of the Minnesota Supreme Court saying we have not, up to now, had to consider First Amendment implications but now we must.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.727" offset="13283219">Under a promissory estoppel, there can be no neutrality towards the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.208" offset="13301087">The Court must... must balance the constitutional rights of a free press against the common law interest in protecting a promise of anonymity, and says that of critical significance to this case is the fact that this promise was made in a classic First Amendment context of the quintessential public debate in our democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.530" offset="13374334">And finally the court concluded that these promises were unenforceable because of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.264" offset="13393351">We would submit, Mr. Chief Justice, that there can be no question that the Minnesota Supreme Court regarded that its decision was required by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.571" offset="13434520">Now, regarding the issue of promissory estoppel, again, under this decision, and under the Christianson decision referred to in the decision below, that under Minnesota law when a party pleads a breach of contract that under Minnesota law that court can decide on the basis of promissory estoppel, which basically implies a contract, that State law of Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.285" offset="13521351">And finally the fact that the Minnesota Supreme Court did consider First Amendment issues is sufficient to give this Court jurisdiction under the several cases that were referred to in the briefs under our longstanding practice by the United States Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.118" offset="13592718">Mr. French says that the issue of whether... if the promise is kept... this is going to prevent the publication of truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.172" offset="13624901">But the question is quite different, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.153" offset="13632842">As a matter of fact, to obtain the truth in many cases up to 75, 80 percent of the cases in terms of certain news media, their media organizations must make these promises of confidentiality to induce sources of information to give them information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.242" offset="13693237">Without these promises, they would not have the truthful information to convey to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.067" offset="13712568">The public would be deprived of information.</text>

            <text syncTime="3397.209" offset="13725106">Well, Mr. Rothenberg, that troubles me a little, because Mr. Cohen could have sent the information in an unmarked envelope presumably, and the paper would still have had it, right?</text>

            <text syncTime="3436.693" offset="13882991">Well, I guess if it was... the question here was just a court record of an earlier prosecution which then the paper could obviously check it.</text>
