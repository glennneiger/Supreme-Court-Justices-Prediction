            <label>Mr. David I. Bruck</label>
            <text syncTime="42.260" offset="302679">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="45.362" offset="315113">This case appears here for the third time.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.147" offset="326294">On two prior occasions this Court has ordered the South Carolina Supreme Court in this capital murder case to grant the relief which Federal law requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.170" offset="366313">On its third consideration, the second remand by this Court, the South Carolina Supreme Court has now, by a 3 to 2 vote, held the two unconstitutional burden-shifting jury presumptions of an essential element of malice in this case to be harmless error, and the propriety of that harmless error determination is now the issue before this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.504" offset="471639">The case, as the Court is already well aware, involves an accomplice liability prosecution in which Dale Yates was convicted of murder and sentenced to death for a homicide which was committed by his accomplice, one Henry Davis, during the course of a robbery, after the time when Yates had already yelled to Davis to leave the scene, had himself left the store, and was either waiting in the car outside or had already fled the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.006" offset="593683">Davis, of course, was then shot to death by the sole surviving witness to the homicide, one Willie Wood, moments after the decedent was stabbed and died.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.683" offset="648436">The State supreme court has found the instructions on malice to have been harmless error on the grounds that identifying really for the first time 8 years after the trial the real issue in the case to have been whether or not Davis, the actual killer, entertained malice, and not whether Mr. Yates entertained malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.596" offset="732028">And then having thus, shall we say clarified, and I would submit really changed the issue that was placed before the jury at trial, into one concerning whether Davis entertained malice when he killed the victim, the court then simply grossly misread the simple record facts before the jury in order to find that malice... that Davis' malice was overwhelmingly proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.164" offset="830352">The particular misreadings, I think, which provide the simplest and best basis upon which this case should be decided are simply that the State supreme court found that Davis lunged at Mrs. Wood with his knife, and that he inflicted a multiple stabbing which resulted in her death.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.439" offset="899420">In fact the record contains no evidence that Davis lunged at Mrs. Wood.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.660" offset="916348">Indeed the very vague and unclear and unsatisfactory evidence from Willie Wood, the only surviving witness, indicates that it was Mrs. Wood who reached for or grabbed Mr. Davis from the side or from the rear, and then seconds later she was stabbed through the heart.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.837" offset="981027">At this point or at some convenient point in your argument could you comment on the argument of the amicus that once evidence of the use of the knife is introduced the presumption of malice disappears under State law in any event?</text>
            <text syncTime="227.798" offset="1044870">I take it I am characterizing that argument correctly.</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="233.202" offset="1066499">Of course, I think that is a rather belated attempt to save what is... in any event what the South Carolina Supreme Court has found to be a burden-shifting and unconstitutional mandatory rebuttable presumption of malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.045" offset="1125850">The... and I would note, of course, that the State, as respondent, has made no such argument in this case, either in the brief in opposition or in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.317" offset="1162943">But in any event, if the Court were to wish to revisit that underlying claim, I think one would be forced to conclude that there is... to say that in a case in which the defendant was not present when the killing occurred, when there was only one witness, the State's witness, who himself did not see... Willie Wood did not see the stabbing.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.981" offset="1249566">So it is not fair to say that the... that... it cannot fairly be said that the circumstances attending the use of the knife were brought out in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.253" offset="1286659">They were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.003" offset="1289690">No one knows exactly how the knife was used, whether Mrs. Wood was stabbed when she lunged at Henry Davis, whether he was flailing in some way trying to get away from the man that was about to put five bullets in him and kill him when he accidentally stabbed Mrs. Wood.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.649" offset="1360220">All of these things are quite possible, but we simply don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.000" offset="1369624">So as far as the amicus, this... they call it a bursting bubble.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.285" offset="1386761">I think the real term is a fly away presumption.</text>

            <text syncTime="349.577" offset="1532001">Of course, but under South Carolina law that does not create an irrebuttable or conclusive presumption of malice, or it does not... the State wishes to create a felony murder rule which does not exist in South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.349" offset="1575051">The shooting by Yates was not of the murder victim, and so that cannot, as a matter of law, supply the malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.253" offset="1598666">It is certainly a factor to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.955" offset="1609533">It is certainly evidence of Yates' state of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.526" offset="1623743">But... but there were contrary, there was contrary evidence, including the fact, the State argued vigorously at trial that this was a, an intent to kill scheme from the beginning, and that was how the case was tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.632" offset="1664181">That was the issue that was... that was joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.834" offset="1672958">And there was certainly evidence that Yates did not have the intent to kill anyone else in the store, that he ran out, he said let's go.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.070" offset="1701902">He ran out of the store still believing that Willie Wood was still alive, which he in fact was, with three unspent rounds in his gun.</text>

            <text syncTime="403.212" offset="1746519">Well, but you're talking about malice... you're not contending that malice, for purposes of South Carolina law, means intent to kill?</text>

            <text syncTime="411.068" offset="1777970">It... in this case it was tried as intent to kill.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.936" offset="1797406">The judge used the term malice interchangeably with intent to kill all the way through his instructions, as I pointed out in the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.709" offset="1828543">There are other ways in which malice can be shown, other than a specific intent to kill a particular individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.529" offset="1855815">However, they are not relevant to this case, both because they were not charged to the jury in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.016" offset="1877758">There are two basic theories that the State tries to bring up at this late date.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.968" offset="1893536">One is so-called depraved heart murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.670" offset="1904299">That is to say a degree of recklessness so extreme that it would be tantamount to intent, and that it would support an inference of malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.311" offset="1958947">And that's, really... the State basically concedes, or at least fails to disagree with our contention that Davis' intent to kill is not overwhelmingly proven, but they say it doesn't matter because mere recklessness is enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.070" offset="2013908">And mere recklessness is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.689" offset="2020387">Recklessness is involuntary manslaughter under South Carolina law.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.307" offset="2034911">There is, however, a greater degree of recklessness which is known in the common law in most States, I think, and certainly in South Carolina as a depraved heart murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.080" offset="2070019">But to say that you... that it is proven overwhelmingly by the unsatisfactory and vague evidence in this case that we are not merely dealing with criminal recklessness in the handling of the knife, but depraved heart malice, that it is that degree of recklessness, simply is not supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.374" offset="2139192">If ever there was a fine gradation that our system of law entrusts to the jury to make, it is that.</text>

            <text syncTime="691.564" offset="2899877">What happened is simply not clear, and it cannot fairly be said that a jury would have had to have found Davis' intent beyond a reasonable doubt simply from the fragments of testimony that were offered by Willie Wood.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.259" offset="2966751">I'd further point out that Mr. Wood, although his bias is surely an understandable one, he is nevertheless about as biased a witness as one is likely to have.</text>

            <text syncTime="739.545" offset="3091825">That's not to say that it wasn't justifiable, it's simply to say that a jury could reasonably have been somewhat critical in evaluating Mr. Davis' testimony, and might reasonably have wondered whether they were getting a picture of what happened in that store, sketchy as it was, that was so reliable as to establish malice beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>

            <text syncTime="965.659" offset="3996289">There are several things I would like to say about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.159" offset="4002349">The first is that the jury would have understood the term killer to refer to defendant, because it's... the court is referring at the beginning of that same instruction to must prove the killing of the deceased by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.466" offset="4055535">And therefore once they have proven the killing of the deceased in some legal way by the law of parties by Yates, he becomes, for purposes of these instructions, the killer.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.220" offset="4090539">It's clear that the jury couldn't have made any sense of these instructions and applied them at all, unless they were willing to treat Yates as the killer that the judge was talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.428" offset="4131394">I would further point out that that instruction came before the judge even got to the subject of accomplice liability, so it's unlikely that when the jury heard that instruction they understood it in any way to refer to the mental state of Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.736" offset="4184579">I think what that... the jury most likely would have understood, and certainly there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury would have understood that what that instruction meant was at the time of the killing they had to look at the intent of the person on trial, the defendant, who... against whom the killing had to be proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.363" offset="4251139">That conclusion is strengthened by the prosecutor's argument in this case, which not once focused on the mental state of Davis, the mental state of malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.969" offset="4289592">Not one word was said about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.338" offset="4295025">On the contrary, the prosecutor said that by the use of the gun, by Yates' use of the gun, that proved that the intent required, the requisite intent... I'm sorry, the requisite malice was in his heart, that is in Yates' heart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.181" offset="4362421">That is the way the prosecutor argued the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.816" offset="4372975">And under those circumstances we have a situation a little like Clemons v. Mississippi where the prosecutor argued the case one way and then the State supreme court, without any explanation, disregards all of that and says it was surely harmless because the judge instructed the jury in some other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.456" offset="4431489">In fact in this case the, the judge did not so instruct the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.443" offset="4451446">And to take this one phrase out of context, as the State does, without any careful attention or any attention at all, I would submit--</text>

            <text syncTime="1959.751" offset="7972648">It says it's the malice and the ill will of the slayer versus that of the accomplice, again focusing on Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.553" offset="7991874">The jury could have not heard these instructions, simply could not have done that and walked away and not focused on Davis' malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.226" offset="8018623">I also think one final point that is very important here to keep in mind is the distinction between malice and intent, which we have tried to argue forcibly in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.795" offset="8052896">The petitioner seems to ignore the distinction, and in fact almost argues at times that the malice and the specific intent to kill, the intent to kill are the same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1989.020" offset="8089781">The court, if you look at these instructions in South Carolina law, the first thing the judge did was tell the jury precisely what malice is in South Carolina in the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.007" offset="8121650">It is something which springs from wickedness, from depravity, from depraved spirit, from a heart devoid of social duty and fatally bent on creating mischief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2164.950" offset="8793415">Let me address, aside from Davis' malice which is the key question here, the petitioner raises what he calls two facts about Yates' mental state which he believes would have been precluded or preempted by this malice instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.424" offset="8843361">First pertains to Yates', and I think I have addressed this somewhat, his subjective expectation, subjective intent that a killing would occur from this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.947" offset="8877425">And second, Yates' intent to withdraw.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.732" offset="8884635">First, strictly speaking, once accomplice liability is properly understood, Yates' mental state is not the relevant one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.803" offset="8912847">It is Davis'.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.519" offset="8915773">But to the extent that Yates' was relevant and the malice charge might have affected it (1) one, under the nature, given the law of accomplice liability, intent... and this is the mistake I believe the petitioner makes, with all due respect to him... intent is not the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.593" offset="8968018">It is malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.260" offset="8970735">It is kind of the extreme gross recklessness, the wanton behavior that Yates so clearly exhibits throughout this whole crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.533" offset="8999783">He has planned it, he has conceded, he has admitted on direct that he has planned it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.984" offset="9013575">He admits he was there to commit an armed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.884" offset="9021203">He admits he clearly fired a shot at Willie Wood at the direction of Davis, which struck ultimately Willie Wood in the chest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.823" offset="9048997">Yates' malice is all over this record, and there is no way the jury could have escaped that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.894" offset="9069268">The instruction could not have turned the jury's attention away from Yates' mental state, because the malice is just so overwhelming they just had to recognize it given the nature of the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.083" offset="9106049">The same thing... I'm sorry, the same thing is true, I think, of the... Yates' intent to withdraw here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.737" offset="9132589">Once again, the charge on withdrawal is proper under South Carolina law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.272" offset="9146800">Exactly what does Yates do here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.391" offset="9155263">Under his own testimony... his own testimony is virtually the only evidence of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.276" offset="9174803">He leaves the store with his gun and the money in hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.913" offset="9189327">He runs out to the passenger side of the vehicle, not the driver's side, the passenger side, gets in, and under his own testimony, waits, waits for Henry Davis, his accomplice, to come out of the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.685" offset="9232377">He is still involved in the criminal enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.221" offset="9238542">They're just trying to make a getaway at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.173" offset="9246379">Once he realizes that Henry Davis is in trouble, perhaps shot, as he was, or caught, he slides over onto the driver's seat and makes his getaway, and is caught moments or minutes later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.779" offset="9288801">There is no withdrawal here whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.564" offset="9295907">There is not even evidence of withdrawal in the record, I think, if properly understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.199" offset="9310431">Clearly Yates was involved in the criminal enterprise to the end.</text>

            <text syncTime="2304.740" offset="9352645">Your opponent argues that the record was misstated by the South Carolina Supreme Court, both by saying that Davis lunged at Mrs. Wood when there is no evidence of that, that she had knife wounds in the plural, and that there were brutal multiple stabbing.</text>

            <label>Mr. Miller W. Shealy, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2337.962" offset="9485556">A couple of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.595" offset="9488063">First if I can address the lunged portion first, if you read the facts, and I think I presume correct in the brief, you read the facts and the testimony of Willie Wood very carefully, I think you get the following picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.102" offset="9530068">And by the way, the argument the petitioner makes to this Court about Willie Wood's testimony, I think it would be appropriate for a jury at closing argument to disbelieve him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.506" offset="9559743">But that's the only thing we have in the record on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.891" offset="9569252">Willie Wood testified that once Yates left the store the only inference in the record is that Davis came at him with the knife, and on two occasions Willie Wood says he was trying to stab me in the back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.766" offset="9616690">The only inference is that Davis was behind Wood, chasing him with the knife, and Willie Wood was trying to get away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.253" offset="9642708">He had a gun on him, we later found, under his coat which he was trying to get to later, but at that time he was scared Yates was going to get him in the back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.406" offset="9667263">Once they got into a scuffle, if you read very carefully Mr. Wood's testimony, he got in a scuffle with Yates and it appears is that Helen Wood came from behind and grabbed Yates in an effort to pull him off Willie Wood at the last minute from behind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.047" offset="9717837">I would submit that as far as the lunging is concerned, the only way Helen Wood could have gotten stabbed is if Yates had somehow turned, thrust the knife, and the pathologist's testimony in this record clearly indicates that the stab wound penetrated, and I quote almost verbatim, the full thickness of her chest, and stabbed her like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.509" offset="9787740">I don't see how she could have been stabbed unless he lunged or thrusted in some manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.044" offset="9801846">So perhaps the South Carolina Supreme Court inferred it from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.163" offset="9814281">As far as the multiple stabbing is concerned, I think that's an artful phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.948" offset="9829432">I think it clearly shows she was stabbed once, although through the full thickness of her chest, as the pathologist testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.101" offset="9850121">It wasn't a scrape, it wasn't a nick.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.553" offset="9855868">It was something that plunged the knife through her entire chest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.755" offset="9868720">I don't even think those facts (1) are really crucial to the harmless error analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.457" offset="9887528">Whether or not she lunged, which I think there was a lunge, which I think there was as a multiple stabbing, is beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.028" offset="9909784">The question is whether Davis had malice as charged and properly defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.397" offset="9923263">This Court can find that even on its own authority without the supreme court's--</text>

            <text syncTime="2505.868" offset="10157112">But I do think this Court on its own authority can conduct the harmless analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2511.755" offset="10180726">I would also point out that with regard to the, to the malice charge in this case, that there was no objection at trial to this charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.159" offset="10206326">The Court has often referenced that in making its own harmless error analysis in cases like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.080" offset="10229941">A trial attorney didn't obviously think it was harmless, has no objection in the record, so I would invite the Court to consider that as part of its analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.253" offset="10258676">As far as the prosecutor's argument is concerned, let me address that because the petitioner did address that in his oral arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.740" offset="10280619">The prosecutor did for sure argue to the jury that there was an intent to kill, and we would submit that there is strong evidence of intent to kill, and the jury could have found that on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.695" offset="10324400">But I think you have to look at that in terms of what kind of case this is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.832" offset="10341014">This is a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.832" offset="10344984">You're only focusing now on the guilt phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.784" offset="10352821">From the beginning of this case the prosecutor knew and was trying to get to a jury verdict at the end which would result in a sentence of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.938" offset="10381451">For that reason I think he was urging upon the jury to find the highest level of scienter of mental state that he possibly could to convince them that Yates was truly a bad person and that the death penalty was warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.961" offset="10421471">He did not necessarily have to get to that high mental state to get murder, but he may have believed, and I think properly so, as a matter of trial strategy, that it was important to get to it in order to get a sentence of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.269" offset="10458774">So that's how I explain the prosecutor's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.119" offset="10466192">I don't think he disregards the definition of malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.904" offset="10477268">The depraved heart aspect is just that he is trying to up and reach a death sentence and not merely a murder conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.759" offset="10508720">With regard to some other aspects of the trial court's charge here, the trial judge did, as I think Justice Scalia pointed out during the petitioner's oral argument, that he comes back to the jury and in essence tells them when all the facts and circumstances surrounding the use of the deadly weapon are before the jury, then in essence the presumption vanishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.455" offset="10575489">Now, I'd submit we know there's a scuffle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.407" offset="10587296">We know who had the weapon, we know who used it, we know how it was used, and we know what happened to Helen Wood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.959" offset="10605477">For all practical intents and purposes, while the South Carolina Supreme Court did not address that I believe because they were constrained by this Court to find that it was violative of Francis v. Franklin, I think nevertheless that could be considered as almost a cure of that particular aspect of the instruction, given the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.820" offset="10672978">Bear briefly what... I would like to reference the standard in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.122" offset="10690114">I do believe that the South Carolina Supreme Court, in applying harmless error analysis, applied the appropriate standard of Chapman v. California, which seems to have been adopted expressly by this Court in Rose v. Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.596" offset="10736090">The way the issue was phrased by this... the majority of this Court in Rose is, is Chapman v. Standard... is the Chapman standard applicable to Sandstrom and Francis type errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.102" offset="10766078">I think the court applied that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.602" offset="10772034">To the extent that the petitioner may argue that the Carella concurrence is valid as far as a new standard, we would submit that it is harmless under either standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.291" offset="10806829">That under South Carolina law looking at Carella, you have an armed robbery as defined in South Carolina with the surrounding circumstances, with the use of a deadly weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.647" offset="10836295">That simply can't be committed as defined under South Carolina law without also having malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.199" offset="10854477">You don't need malice under South Carolina law to be convicted of armed robbery, but for sure if you commit armed robbery... and if you commit armed robbery in South Carolina, you have to also commit the lesser included offenses of larceny and assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.423" offset="10899407">And to commit armed robbery with the use of a deadly weapon like this, we would submit, is clear evidence of malice, especially the way this particular crime was carried out.</text>

            <text syncTime="2714.355" offset="10991045">--I don't want to get into a semantic quibble.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.974" offset="11001598">I shy away from the word felony murder because in my experience there is typically statutory number of States, and we don't have a statute like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.544" offset="11027825">We have accomplice liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.794" offset="11032841">The jury was charged not, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if you find a felony, an armed robbery is a felony, then you must presume malice, and therefore presume murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.816" offset="11060948">That might be a classic and erroneous felony murder type instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.601" offset="11076099">That's not what they were told.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.701" offset="11080488">They were told, again... to go back to page 150, the accomplice liability, if you find the unlawful act, the combination to commit an unlawful act, and the way it was committed and the nature of the act, and the way it was carried out, a natural and probable consequence is that a death could result, you can convict the accomplice, even though he's not the slayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.528" offset="11139734">That's what they were told.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.147" offset="11146212">They were never told, ladies and gentlemen, armed robbery is a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.349" offset="11155094">If you find the armed robbery then you can also find murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.467" offset="11167528">That perhaps is felony murder, and that's not the charge that was given in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.436" offset="11187381">If I may conclude there briefly by saying that because the error here is factually harmless, it should not be declared legally prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.025" offset="11213817">This is so because under the charge the jury would have had to focus on Davis' malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.810" offset="11228863">No other possibility was reasonably likely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.345" offset="11238999">Furthermore, nothing in the charge would have precluded the jury's consideration of Yates' own mental state, particularly in light of the overwhelming evidence of his own malice.</text>

            <label>Mr. David I. Bruck</label>
            <text syncTime="2790.605" offset="11296050">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.057" offset="11309843">If I may, Justice Souter's question observed that the trial judge at one point in the charge referred interchangeably to malice and intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.096" offset="11354042">I would point out that there is a second point later on in his charge point, at page 97 of the Joint Appendix, where he said, referring to malice aforethought, he said, he defined that or explained that as that there must be a combination of a previous evil intent and the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.272" offset="11410780">Again, repeatedly we have this equation in the charge between intent and malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.493" offset="11435649">So I think the, the State's efforts to drive some great distinction between those two really have no application to this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.901" offset="11481311">Further increasing, we would submit, the likelihood that the jury interpreted the issue, the presumptions to apply to Yates' mental state is the language that on the instruction at page 98 of the Joint Appendix, that a defendant... this is during the discussion of accomplice liability... the judge says that the defendant is not responsible for a homicide committed by his co-defendant as an independent act growing out of some private malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.534" offset="11587786">Now obviously the jury would have had to have interpreted that to mean, or likely interpreted that to mean that well, there is private malice and then there is something like shared malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.824" offset="11624984">The malice that Yates, in engaging in this dangerous, if it was a dangerous conspiracy likely to result in death, would have... would have entertained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.913" offset="11661347">And that really makes... the State tells you that there is no issue about Yates' mental state, that that is completely irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.186" offset="11686424">Well, that is simply wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.569" offset="11691962">There are two areas in which mental... in which Yates' mental state were crucial, even if the jury had focused on Davis' malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.624" offset="11728116">First is that Yates' mental state is crucial as to the scope and particularly as to the dangerousness, the likely homicidal nature of the original agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.349" offset="11771061">That is simply a question of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.099" offset="11778062">What is it that Yates... what sort of a crime did Yates intend to commit?</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.186" offset="11798437">Originally Yates definitely joined the issue, that was the core of his defense, which was we intended not to use any violence at all and to retreat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.609" offset="11832083">Now that's obviously not the way it worked out, but in order to convict him of accomplice liability South Carolina law is clear that the agreement which triggers the vicarious liability must be an agreement to commit a crime which is life threatening.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.301" offset="11894881">And the authority for that is State v. Peterson, a case which I discuss in the reply brief--</text>

            <text syncTime="3023.974" offset="12229562">I would say that it was not harmless error, because I don't think that this jury clearly focused on Davis' mental state in order to convict Yates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.513" offset="12271672">And you simply... it's very difficult... it may be possible to parse these instructions through hours of careful study to find a way in which the jury focused on Davis' intent, but I doubt very seriously that that's what this jury did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.506" offset="12327678">The best that can be said, I mean, we argue our inference and the State argues theirs, and we each say that it's clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.493" offset="12351606">I think probably the fairest way of looking at these instructions and the way this case was tried is that it was a confused, tangled mess, and we really don't know what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.681" offset="12392357">In order for this man to have been accorded his Sixth Amendment jury trial right, I think the dissenting opinion below, Justice Toal's opinion, was exactly right when she said that from the confusing instructions the jury might... probably concluded that it was Yates' malice that had to be determined, and that would naturally have been prejudiced by the... by the two, by either or both of the burden-shifting jury instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.499" offset="12495698">That is the fairest reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.949" offset="12501445">And I will, you know, I will concede that there is a way to twist and turn through this tangled up record to get to the view the State wants, but I just don't think that there is any fair basis for concluding that that is what... that is what the jury did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.258" offset="12558705">And that is the harmless error inquiry, not whether it was necessary for the jury to rely on the instructions, but whether this man was really accorded a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.650" offset="12600292">In closing, I would just submit that if ever there was a case in which the jury trial right, the right to have a person's guilt found by a jury of their peers, and not by an appellate court or even by this high Court, it is in a capital murder case involving vicarious liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.343" offset="12667061">We are now at the very outer barrier of the moral authority of the criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.729" offset="12684615">That's not to say that it raises any constitutional problem to convict a person, but it most certainly does if we can't say that the facts--</text>
