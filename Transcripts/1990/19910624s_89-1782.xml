            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73980">The second case is Blatchford versus Native Village of Noatak No. 89-1782.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.829" offset="105222">That case is also here on petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.579" offset="132285">In 1980, Alaska enacted a revenue sharing plan that provided annual payments to Alaskan native villages about $25,000 to each village.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.954" offset="177738">The State's attorney general expressed his opinion that the statute was unconstitutional because it restricted the grants to a racially exclusive group.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.564" offset="216191">To meet that objection, the state legislature subsequently expanded the program to cover all unincorporated communities regardless of the racial composition of their members.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.895" offset="261539">Since the available funds had to be distributed more broadly, each native village received less than it previously would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.939" offset="289647">The respondents in this case are two native villages that were affected by this change.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.752" offset="308978">They challenged the new program claiming that it too violated the equal protection clause and they sought damages for the legislature's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.767" offset="340951">The District Court dismissed the action on the basis of the Eleventh Amendment which recognizes the state's sovereign immunity against suit in Federal Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.298" offset="375120">The Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.736" offset="384837">First, on the ground that congress had abrogated state immunity from suit by Indians and then upon reconsideration, on the ground that the Eleventh Amendment did not apply to suits by Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.768" offset="433007">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.659" offset="452547">We first reject the view advanced by respondent that the Eleventh Amendment does not apply to suits by Indian tribes because Indian tribes are sovereigns, not individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.221" offset="490790">We rejected that same argument many years ago in a case called Monaco versus Mississippi, where we held that states retained their immunity against suits by foreign nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.455" offset="535720">If immunity survives against foreign sovereigns, there is no reason why it would not survive against domestic sovereigns as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.721" offset="564769">Likewise, we reject respondent's claim that waiver of state immunity against suit by Indian tribes is inherent in the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.985" offset="597892">Where we have found such an inherent waver in the structure of the constitution, it has been an even exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.841" offset="625268">Each state, for example, has waved its own immunity from suits by other states in exchange for their wa'ver of immunity from suits by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.716" offset="660795">Here, however, there would be no mutuality.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.607" offset="672393">States would become subject to suit by Indian tribes while Indian tribes remain immune to suits by states.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.294" offset="699142">This is not inherent in the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.762" offset="708964">Finally, we do not believe that the statute granting District Court's jurisdiction to hear federal claims by Indian tribes 28 U.S.C. 1362 operates to negate state immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.590" offset="756298">Contrary to respondent's suggestion, this is neither a delegation to tribes of the federal government's authority to sue on the Indian's behalf nor is it a congressional abrogation of state immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.293" offset="799139">Section 1362 is simply a grant of jurisdiction to hear claims arising under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.215" offset="822754">A grant of jurisdiction to hear a claim does not, in of itself, negate defenses to that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.028" offset="846055">Justice Blackmun has filed a dissent in which Justices Marshall and Stevens joined.</text>
