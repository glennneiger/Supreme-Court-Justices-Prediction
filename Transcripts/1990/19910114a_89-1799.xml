            <text syncTime="124.108" offset="625150">Then they went a step further and they said, as an example of the latter, that a fictionalized quote created no inference of malice because it was consistent with the speaker's lifestyle and his idea of fun.</text>

            <text syncTime="3084.382" offset="12466247">I think that the purpose of looking at the words is to determine whether there is a knowing misrepresentation of what I keep calling the gist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.972" offset="12504595">The fact that there is a difference in words by itself, if you don't connect it to that other inquiry, I think means nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3155.231" offset="12749623">Number one, you got a third person quote and a misquote attributed to a third person.</text>

            <text syncTime="3169.490" offset="12806675">And the third example is you've got a third person quote, or at least third person evidence, and you misattribute that by means of a first person quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.829" offset="12855994">If I understand you, you're saying that when we've got simply the misquotation as between two third parties, the mere fact of the misquotation may be, as I was trying to say, competent evidence of malice, but it is not sufficient in and of itself as an abstract matter to rise to the level of clear and convincing evidence of malice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3209.941" offset="12968425">Likewise, you have been arguing, I think, that when there are, when we're talking about differences between two first person quotes, you're saying, I think you're conceding again yes, a misquotation can be some evidence of malice, but it is not enough to go to a jury because unless it is just an absolutely egregious example that totally changes the substance it could not rise to the level of clear and convincing.</text>
