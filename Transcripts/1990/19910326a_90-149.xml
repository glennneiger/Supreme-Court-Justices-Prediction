            <text syncTime="46.292" offset="315243">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="50.434" offset="331752">The issue before the Court today is whether the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment is violated when the notice and hearing provision of the Michigan Rape Shield Law is applied to exclude arguably relevant evidence when no attempt is made to cure the defect until the very day of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.495" offset="404059">The Michigan court of appeals in this particular case held that not only the 10-day notice provision, but also the pretrial hearing provision of the Rape Shield Law, violated the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights to confrontation, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="82.395" offset="459648">"when applied to preclude the evidence of specific instances of prior sexual conduct between the complainant and the defendant. "</text>
            <text syncTime="90.221" offset="490890">At the outset let me make clear what the statute both requires and what it prohibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.413" offset="511684">What the statute requires simply is two things: that a notice be filed within 10 days after the arraignment on the information requesting the court to hold a hearing to determine whether particular evidence of prior sexual conduct between the defendant and the victim is relevant and is to be admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.414" offset="579707">This notice in turn triggers a very important procedural aspect of this case, and that is the pretrial hearing to determine whether or not the evidence is both logically and legally admissible in the case when tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.385" offset="635609">The importance, I think, of the Rape Shield Law, at least the one we're dealing with here in Michigan, is that the underlying principle of that particular notice provision serves two very fundamental purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.741" offset="685032">The major premise, of course, that the legislature of Michigan decided upon was that the victim of sexual assaults certainly has a right to her sexual privacy, and that in doing so we want to counterbalance that interest, which I believe is clearly a legitimate interest, with the interest of the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="345.876" offset="1513532">What the defendant, I think, wished to get across to the court and the trier of fact was that there was an intimate relationship which may have included a sexual aspect to that relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.231" offset="1546969">There was no indication of an offer of proof or otherwise that the specific details of the sexual encounters they had earlier, before these events occurred on August 31, had any particular relevance to the defense presented at trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="610.292" offset="2571178">Your Honor, again, this statute was the first one in the country to be enacted in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.854" offset="2589463">And I think others were modeled perhaps after it, and changed subsequently depending upon the nature of the legislature's interest in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.697" offset="2608794">But in this particular case trials in Michigan, once the arraignment of the information is had, actually enters onto a relatively fast track.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.183" offset="2646724">In this case I think the docket entries and the case inquiry notice, which is part of the court record, would indicate that the trial date originally was set for sometime in late November, a period of only 4 weeks after the arraignment on the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.410" offset="2691654">There was a final conference date of November 14, 1984, at which point the first adjournment was had.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.496" offset="2719971">What I am trying to indicate, of course, to the Justice is this, that the 10-day period after the arraignment was set because essentially many cases in Michigan, even cases such as this, a major felony case, could be tried within a very short period of time after the arraignment.</text>

            <text syncTime="672.543" offset="2820177">That would be an equally accurate way of looking at the effect of this?</text>

            <text syncTime="676.264" offset="2835119">I think it could have been done either way, Your Honor, but I think the arraignment on the information date was selected because, quite frankly, Federal felony trials such as this could be tried, certainly in Wayne County even though it's a busy metropolitan court, anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks after the arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.682" offset="2884751">So by setting it earlier you accomplish a number of tasks required of it, namely that you do not surprise the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.909" offset="2913695">There are cases in which extensive prehearings, pretrial hearings may be necessary in a case such as this or even one in which the facts are somewhat different.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.164" offset="2946714">You prevent the surprise, you permit both sides an opportunity to gather their sources, if you will, for full investigation and analysis at that closed in camera hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.690" offset="2984748">It also provides another important aspect, and that is for the judge in the individual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.542" offset="3004183">Rather than getting to a position 1 day or the day of trial in which you have what may be called hydraulic pressures upon the court to go at that time with the trial, if you have a pretrial hearing sufficiently in advance of trial, the trial judge has the opportunity to sit back calmly, if you will, or at least in a more detached, less pressurized atmosphere, to consider the arguments and the evidence of both sides, both the defendant's evidence and the prosecution's evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.740" offset="3108987">So there are some very important I think benefits not only to the prosecution but also to the defendant in preparing the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.893" offset="3141587">And I think when you have a situation in which the evidence sought to be excluded or included, if it's the defendant's point of view, is that you have an opportunity again for that thorough analysis beforehand of permitting a more realistic, even-handed approach.</text>

            <text syncTime="2291.212" offset="9294887">You look at the evidence, an offer of proof is made, and there is an objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.657" offset="9320696">The jury is sent out and then you decide, for instance, if there are photographs or something, is it more prejudicial than probative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.363" offset="9347445">Trial courts do this day in and day out, make these type of rulings all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.103" offset="9366463">So what the Michigan court of appeals was saying is that in these particular situations this is no different, that it could have happened right then.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.217" offset="9394884">The trial court could have fashioned other remedies as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.091" offset="9406378">I hate to suggest this, but it could have fined trial counsel for bringing the motion at the eleventh hour.</text>

            <text syncTime="2499.833" offset="10129343">The failure to go into this, to permit this, it was suggested by counsel that it was not that big a deal, but the thing is that this was important testimony on the issue, in a narrow issue of consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.783" offset="10201127">In these cases the failure to allow inquiry into this past sexual relationship undermined the integrity of the fact-finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.461" offset="10239893">The fact finder would have a different impression, if you will, of the credibility not only of the complaining witness but then also of the defendant, of his position, his theory, because there were two sides to this story, as there is in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.711" offset="10304885">And so without that, having that knowledge of the rather extensive relationship between the parties, the fact finder was deprived of having the full picture, was not able to make findings of fact based on all of the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.493" offset="10371968">And in this case, and as the... as Michigan has held and all jurisdictions, the... on the issue of, when the defense is consent the prior sexual relationship between the individual parties is more probative than prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.302" offset="10435289">And as far as, in terms of the Law Review and other articles, the experts who have reviewed this, the State legislature in all States have come to similar conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.071" offset="10486280">So the evidence was relevant, was material, and was more probative than prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.674" offset="10508745">And I think what is also important here is the... more or less the flip side of the coin is that not only was the defendant unable to cross-examine the complaining witness on this, he was unable to testify in his... in his own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.076" offset="10574365">And so even assuming that, in this case that the witness, the complaining witness, couldn't be cross-examined, what justification was there not to allow the defendant in his own behalf to testify?</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.657" offset="10648657">The purpose 00 there is two purposes, as we have discussed, of why this notice provision existed, but one of the purposes is not to penalize a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.153" offset="10686691">He was deprived of getting on the stand and giving his... his own version of what occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.508" offset="10716053">And this is similar to cases where, for instance, the trial court held that a confession was voluntary and then prohibited at the time of trial the defendant from testifying about police coercion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2984.501" offset="12068046">There would be some inconvenience, because the normal administration of justice, but there are normally, in any felony trial there is normally motions eliminating other pretrial matters taken up by a court, and frequently other types of hearings are conducted at the type of trial, walker hearing, motions to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.802" offset="12141294">Testimony sometimes in Wayne County is heard even at the day of trial because you have the witnesses present and they don't... trial doesn't require... the trial court doesn't require witnesses to come down twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.560" offset="12184239">They come down once for the motion and then for the day of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.264" offset="12199076">So there would be some inconvenience, but on the other hand there could be convenience for doing it at the time of trial as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.525" offset="12224154">Now, there is just one other area I would like to address, and that is there has been a suggestion that this should be remanded to determine whether this was harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.595" offset="12268458">And I would just indicate that the Michigan Supreme Court, after the court of appeals decided this case there was an appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.149" offset="12306596">The Michigan Supreme Court then remanded to the court of appeals for harmless error analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.755" offset="12333032">The Michigan court of appeals made that analysis and determined that since credibility was central to the case, that this was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.780" offset="12377127">So, and here this Court has given great deference to the State court's interpretation regarding harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.706" offset="12412863">This is different than, say, Van Arsdall where there was no State determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.140" offset="12430626">And in fact the Michigan... after that analysis was made it was then taken back up to the Michigan Supreme Court, and the Michigan Supreme Court let the decision stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.036" offset="12466152">So here there is... we believe that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and we would ask that the Michigan court of appeals decision be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.103" offset="12510456">That concludes my argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="3105.310" offset="12551311">I believe if the Court in reading the case will understand that what the court of appeals of Michigan did in this case was really say flat out that whenever you're excluding evidence which involves prior sexual conduct between the defendant and the complainant in a particular case, that alone... that alone violates the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.343" offset="12631455">The only issue that I think is properly before this Court, as I have tried to emphasize earlier in this case, is that the question being whether the operation of the notice and prehearing provisions of the Rape Shield Law in and of themselves are violative of a defendant's right to confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.234" offset="12702926">That is the only issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3232.103" offset="13058400">I think the issues of whether or not the evidence may have been relevant, again whether they are issues of ineffective assistance of counsel and failure to raise it, are all collateral issues which, even in the State of Michigan, a defendant can raise in subsequent proceedings after consideration by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.033" offset="13118169">But I think again, in conclusion, Your Honor, that there is nothing in the Constitution which would have prevented the kind of remedy provided here.</text>
