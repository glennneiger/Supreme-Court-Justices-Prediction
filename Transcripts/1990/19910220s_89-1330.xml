            <text syncTime="13.113" offset="126322">Respondent, a candidate for Union president, requested the Union to provide him with mailing labels so that he could arrange for a timely mailing of campaign literature to Union members prior to the Union's nominating convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.935" offset="181702">The request was denied because the Union rule prohibited such pre-convention mailings.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.835" offset="205212">The question presented by this case is whether a court must evaluate the reasonableness of a Union's rule before it decides whether a candidate's request was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.529" offset="248053">Respondent filed suit under Section 401(c) which requires every Union to comply with all reasonable request of any candidate who wants to distribute campaign literature at his own expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.152" offset="294551">The District Court granted a preliminary injunction in respondent's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.274" offset="311060">The Fourth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.391" offset="315449">And today, we also affirm the judgment of the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.325" offset="335197">In our view, Section 401(c) prescribes a straightforward test.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.426" offset="351602">Is the candidate's distribution request reasonable?</text>
            <text syncTime="72.335" offset="363305">The Section's language requires Unions to comply with all reasonable requests.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.961" offset="385771">This literal interpretation of the statute is consistent with its basic purpose of insuring free and democratic Union elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.342" offset="415341">We reject the Union's argument that the request was per se unreasonable simply because it conflicts with the Union rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.125" offset="442404">The Union does not advance any other reason for rejecting respondent's request and thus, the request must be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.551" offset="468109">Our opinion is unanimous.</text>
