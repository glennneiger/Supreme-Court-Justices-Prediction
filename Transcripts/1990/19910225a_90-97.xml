            <text syncTime="12.109" offset="182508">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.331" offset="195360">This case presents the narrow statutory question of whether the National Labor Relations Act permits the Board to establish a rule determining that eight specific bargaining units, and only those units, are appropriate for every acute care hospital in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.101" offset="258472">We believe that the language and legislative history of Section 9(b) of the act, as well as the contemporaneous interpretation of the act by the Board, make it clear that the rule is not permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.477" offset="299954">Section 9(b) requires that the Board determine the appropriate unit in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.622" offset="324614">The Board and the unions argue that those words refer solely to the proceeding in which the Board is to issue unit determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.629" offset="356588">In their view, as long as the Board goes through the formality of the hearing the requirements of the statute are met, even if that formality is an empty one leading in every case to the same preordained result.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.924" offset="405802">Of course Section 9(c) already requires hearings in contested representation cases, so in the Board's view the "in each case" language, which was added deliberately by amendment to the Wagner bill, adds nothing to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.345" offset="463481">Well, those words do mean something, and their meaning is demonstrated not only by the words themselves, but by both the legislative history of Section 9(b) and the Board's contemporaneous and longstanding interpretation of that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.023" offset="514158">The statutory language and its history were clear enough in 1980 and again in 1982 for the Board itself to hold that the adoption of a rule that a unit of registered nurses would be appropriate in every case would be, quote, 9(b) responsibility to decide in each case whether the requested unit is appropriate.</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="118.167" offset="606736">Mr. Holzhauer, we have to determine what the meaning of the "in each case" language is in this context, and it occurs to me that this Court, for example, has an obligation to consider each case on its plenary docket, and yet we search for rules of general applicability to be applied to these cases.</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="144.065" offset="710286">Now, isn't the Board doing essentially a similar thing in searching for some kind of rule of general applicability for most cases, leaving, of course, its extraordinary circumstances out if necessary?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_d_holzhauer" startTime="162.118" stopTime="206.547">
            <label>Mr. James D. Holzhauer</label>
            <text syncTime="162.118" offset="782593">Sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.586" offset="784473">Well, the Board is making that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.618" offset="788549">They're arguing that the extraordinary circumstances exception allows it to consider in each case whether there are exceptions allowing a different result from the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.944" offset="825851">But the extraordinary circumstances exception, which the Board did not say in its rulemaking allowed case-by-case determination of the... of each case, in fact it did not rely on the extraordinary circumstances exception for the purpose now asserted by the Board, that exception is so narrow as to be illusory.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.966" offset="897949">The Board has made it clear in the rulemaking that it will no longer consider the individual facts and circumstances of each hospital, and it will disregard all of the factors it regards as critical in every other industry, and that it always regarded as critical in this industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1216.731" offset="5000950">--Well, let me respond in two different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.884" offset="5009623">First of all, the "in each case" requirement requires case-by-case consideration of bargaining units, and if the American Hospital Association took a contrary position and made an argument that is contrary to what the statute means, the American Hospital Association was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.763" offset="5069078">Secondly, a uniform rule or a uniform... that's right, a uniform rule or a uniform policy does not have to be a conclusive presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.779" offset="5109202">It doesn't have to say we will regard these units as appropriate in each and every case, regardless of the facts and circumstances of each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.285" offset="5139190">A uniform rule can allow for meaningful exceptions, which is not what this rule does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.317" offset="5159357">In fact a uniform rule can be like the rules that the Board has established in other industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.230" offset="5179001">In no other industry has the Board established a rule that particular units and only those particular units will be appropriate in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.458" offset="5211915">In those few industries where the Board has established presumptions, employers are given the full opportunity to rebut those presumptions and to show that the facts and circumstances of a particular workplace warrant a different result.</text>

            <text syncTime="1289.790" offset="5293208">I assume that there has been litigation in some industries, but there has never been a rulemaking like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.624" offset="5316614">And also, our industry had a much different history than other industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.147" offset="5330616">Our industry was not covered by and large by the National Labor Relations Act, at least the dominant nonproprietary sector was not covered by the National Labor Relations Act until 1974, at least between 1947 and 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.414" offset="5383696">And the announcement that it would suddenly cover did give rise to an increased amount of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.127" offset="5406580">There is no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.179" offset="5410759">But other industries have litigation over units and appropriate units over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.063" offset="5434374">But in all those other cases the employer is allowed to offer evidence to rebut the presumption and to show that the facts and circumstances of the particular workplace warrant a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.490" offset="5480036">There is no such possibility under the Board's rule, and the Board emphasized in its rulemaking that it was not merely establishing rebuttable presumptions that the eight units were correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.968" offset="5525907">I think it's important to realize that acceptance of our argument would not mean that those other vastly different rules would be invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.761" offset="5557149">When those other rules are applied, the Board continues to give case-by-case consideration to the facts and circumstances of each employer and to comply with the "in each case" requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.219" offset="5602916">We're not engaging in any broad attack on presumptions or upon the Board's rulemaking authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.123" offset="5626531">We're merely making the argument that in this one area, where the statute requires case-by-case consideration, the Board must take into account the circumstances of each employer and cannot adopt rules that eliminate that consideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1590.128" offset="6494632">After 13 years of extensive controversy, uncertainty, delay, and expense, the Labor Board decided to initiate a rulemaking proceeding on the vexing question of unit determinations in the health care industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.401" offset="6575716">After some 2 years, which included two very extensive notices of proposed rulemaking, a number of significant modifications in the proposed rule, consideration of some 3,500 pages of testimony from over 140 witnesses, and 1,800 written submissions, the Board formulated its final rule, specifying the types of bargaining units that in the absence of extraordinary circumstances would be considered appropriate on the filing of a proper petition for most acute care hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.287" offset="6747184">I sure doubt, parenthetically, as Mr. Holzhauer has mentioned, that the rule specifically contemplates the possibility of a union petition for a combination of units, and in that sense the regulation is significant in imposing a ceiling rather than a floor.</text>

            <text syncTime="2024.752" offset="8233133">If you go back to the history of the 1935 legislation, the "in each case" language was one of a number of amendments proposed by Secretary of Labor Bergens as she described it for the sake of clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.423" offset="8295722">That clarification may not have been essential, but it was helpful because the very specific petition requirement of Section 9(c), which the Board later developed and which now appears in Section 9(c), was not a part of the original act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.745" offset="8373045">The original Section 9(c) was a good deal vaguer about how the process worked, and in that context we believe the "in each case" provision was a useful one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.683" offset="8420797">We do not believe that that clarifying language should be given the radical and very destructive definition that petitioner would give it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.239" offset="8459040">It does not preclude the Board from formulating rules of decision that facilitate a determination that in a particular case there is no genuine issue of material fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="2109.019" offset="8570113">One is that very similar arguments have over the past 35 years been rejected by this Court in a series of decisions beginning with Storer Broadcasting back in the 1950's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.698" offset="8628836">The argument has been repeatedly made that particular regulations cannot survive challenge, not because they clash with some substantive provision of law, but because they are at odds with the statutory requirement of an opportunity for a hearing or a statutory requirement of a individualized determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.285" offset="8727265">This Court has repeatedly rejected those challenges on the grounds they do not undermine the fundamental administrative authority to formulate rules of decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.430" offset="8767807">It did so in the Storer case in the 1950's, in the Texaco case in the 1960's--</text>

            <text syncTime="2190.841" offset="8897479">Now what the communications decision... commission did was to say that if a station owner already owned five stations, he could not get a sixth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2213.695" offset="8988908">If a station owner already had five stations, there was no genuine issue of material fact that required a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.352" offset="9019523">This language, "in each case", says nothing about a requirement of a hearing, and does not address the sources of law to be applied in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.169" offset="9066753">Now the, the precedent of the Storer case has been repeatedly applied by this Court, in Texaco in the 1960's, more recently in WNCN, in Heckler and Campbell, and just last month in the Mobile case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.668" offset="9128715">So not only is there a long line of precedent in this Court, there is also, we believe, a consistent view of the Labor Board that squares with its position in this proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2282.611" offset="9264552">I think one was that the Board had had a good deal of difficulty both understanding the industry, acquiring enough information, and in persuading the courts of appeals that it was acting consistently with its legal obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.497" offset="9352114">The courts of appeals were widely divided on what those obligations were, very widely divided, but they all did seem to agree on one thing, and that is that the Board had to address the problem as a distinctive problem in a distinctive way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.995" offset="9414077">And I think the Board was both responding to that and to its very acute need for more information by undertaking this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.451" offset="9451902">I also believe that part of what the Board was doing was an echo of what it tried to do in the first St. Francis case, that is the Board was mindful of the admonition in the 1974 committee reports that there should not be too many bargaining units, and one thing it tried to do in its first St. Francis case was to set a ceiling on the number of bargaining units that would be authorized in the industry to prevent the kind of balkanization that had occurred in the construction industry, which is an industry that had a very large number of different skills and crafts, very much like a hospital industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.660" offset="9620758">And so one of the objectives of this rule, we believe, and a very significant one, was to establish a cap on the number of units which would apply in each case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2774.103" offset="11230527">The Board's view, as articulated in its decision in this case, is that the admonition in those committee reports, which neither accompanies nor explains any relevant statutory language, it does not have any binding legal effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.667" offset="11320702">The admonition is a request to the committee, to the Board by the relevant committees.</text>

            <text syncTime="2814.650" offset="11392696">Now, we also contend that even if the admonitions were incorporated in the statute itself that the Board has fully complied with their letter and their spirit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.928" offset="11441806">The admonition, to begin with, does not, despite petitioner's heroic efforts, does not speak at all to the choice between rulemaking and adjudication.</text>

            <text syncTime="2858.157" offset="11566671">The Board has done that in this rule in two very significant ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.801" offset="11589241">First of all, it has paid very close attention to the problem of the number of units.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.307" offset="11619334">It has determined on the basis of the record and its experience that there is no domino effect in the hospital industry, that the authorization of a particular unit, and most of the units that have been authorized look like the units that are specified in this regulation, that the authorization of a particular unit--</text>

            <text syncTime="2920.988" offset="11818073">But the history shows, most of the time by consent and sometimes by litigation, that when registered nurses seek a unit a registered nurses' unit will be authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.476" offset="11863945">In fact the two main controversies that have led to litigation are rather limited ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.089" offset="11886410">One involves registered nurses and whether they should be combined with other professionals, and the other involves separate maintenance workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.515" offset="11920160">But a report by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service shows that of all hospitals that have bargaining units today, 55 percent have only one bargaining unit, 80 percent have two or less, and 90 percent have three or less.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.518" offset="11996124">And the Board was conscious of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.089" offset="12006469">The Board also, as I have suggested, was very conscious of the need to put a cap on the number of units to prevent the kind of balkanization that occurred in the construction industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.768" offset="12057146">So the Board has ruled that all other professionals are confined to one unit, that all technical workers, despite the very substantial difference in their skills and their functions, are combined in one unit, that all skilled maintenance workers, despite the balkanization od... of workers in other industries, are confined to one unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.012" offset="12154113">So the Board has been concerned about the numbers problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.595" offset="12168428">The Board has also investigated exhaustively the question whether the evils thought to come with proliferation are associated with these bargaining units, and the Board has determined that they are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.937" offset="12233838">The statistics indicate that the strike rate in the hospital industry is quite low, lower than in other industries, and indeed there is empirical evidence to suggest that the size of units, or... I'm sorry, the number of units is inversely related to the likelihood of a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.319" offset="12319311">Beyond that there is evidence, and indeed it doesn't take a lot of evidence to know that the larger the bargaining unit, the more disruptive a strike is like to be, especially in the absence of a sympathy strike.</text>
