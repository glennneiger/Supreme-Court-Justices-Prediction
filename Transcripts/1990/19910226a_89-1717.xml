            <text syncTime="934.365" offset="3870478">The drug interdiction procedure that is at issue here is a natural outgrowth of airline interdiction programs, airport interdiction programs, that this Court has had before it in several cases: in Mendenhall, in Florida against Royer, and in Florida against Rodriguez.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.964" offset="3956891">As law enforcement efforts at airports have borne fruit, not surprisingly, drugs have been transported, in the experience of law enforcement officials in other ways, including by trains and by bus.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.147" offset="4013629">This tool, which was employed in Broward County is a tool that is employed increasingly across the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.394" offset="4046648">It is used here in the District of Columbia and in other jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.751" offset="4063993">It is carried out in a reasonable and professional and non-intimidating way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1011.333" offset="4178409">It is only unusual in the sense that it is relatively new.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.191" offset="4197845">Broward County began implementing this in the early 1980's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.315" offset="4210279">This jurisdiction began implementing it 3 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.705" offset="4227833">All Federal courts of appeals that have now been confronted with the legality of this have unanimously sustained it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.419" offset="4262733">No dissents whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.903" offset="4268689">The Fourth Circuit's opinion in Flowers, in particular, speaking the Fourth Circuit speaking through Judge Wilkinson made, I think, a pivotal point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.165" offset="4301707">This program is not only valuable in assuring the interdiction of drugs; but it is also valuable in terms of depriving individuals of dangerous weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.223" offset="4345907">That is one aspect of this program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.082" offset="4353325">And the results in Broward County are quite consistent with those in the District of Columbia and elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.517" offset="4375059">Not only are drugs seized, but weapons are seized as well; 45 dangerous weapons were seized by Broward County in the space of a year and a half.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.811" offset="4412258">In terms of the procedures that are employed, no, I don't think that they are intimidating, and I think that for this reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="1081.336" offset="4458338">They have read this Court's cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.336" offset="4466383">They know that they cannot be confrontational.</text>

            <text syncTime="1134.455" offset="4670870">This Court, by the way, has in Schneckloth and in Mendenhall and in Delgado, said, it is irrelevant whether you have been told whether you are free to cooperate or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.686" offset="4711830">The point is, this is a free society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.232" offset="4721965">You have the right to say no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.232" offset="4730011">This Court has had cases before it in which individuals have asserted that right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1154.449" offset="4750805">Brown against Texas, the police offices come to the individual and he says, I am not going to cooperate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1168.241" offset="4805975">Whether they must, in response to Justice Scalia's question, is a different matter in terms of Fourth Amendment analysis, because the critical Fourth Amendment inquiry is whether, as General Fowler put it, under the totality of the circumstances, there has been a show of force, a display of force or a show of authority so as to restrain the individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="1391.215" offset="5697900">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.964" offset="5708871">At the outset, I would like to note that there is nothing in the record of this case that indicates anything about the training of the officers or the procedures that they were instructed to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.929" offset="5752757">There is material in later cases, indeed cases out of Broward County indicating in later years, not in 1985, when this case occurred, but in later years following this case and others, that they did in fact adopt certain procedures which included standing behind the seat rather than in front of it; not displaying weapons; and a number of other safeguards which indeed are not present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.575" offset="5847320">So I think it is important, number one, to decide this case on the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.323" offset="5866338">And I would like very briefly to review those facts, because I must say my view of them does not in every particular, accord with what the Court has just heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.727" offset="5903954">Briefly, on the morning of August 27th, these two officers boarded this Greyhound bus, at roughly 8:00 or so in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.785" offset="5940212">As they got on, the driver got off and went inside, closing the door of the bus behind him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.392" offset="5962573">The officers had no suspicion of anyone of the bus that morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.282" offset="5978142">Nonetheless, they both wore raid jackets that had the words sheriff's office, not only across the back, but across the front of the jacket.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.763" offset="6012101">We haven't heard anything yet today about the gun, not so much as one word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.854" offset="6036447">But there was a gun indisputably in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.852" offset="6048463">Indeed, on page five of Florida's brief, they concede that the gun in Officer Nutt's hand, in a pouch was recognizable as a gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.598" offset="6091409">And that, I think, is a very critical point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1613.330" offset="6586377">In any event, the officers did go to the back of the bus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.671" offset="6607693">As was indicated, Mr. Bostick was reclining on the last seat on the bus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.654" offset="6627650">Whether he was asleep or not is disputed and there are, of course, no fact-findings here, so we don't know what the court found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.854" offset="6656489">But, he was clearly lying down, attempting to get some rest, and was roused, either by being touched on the foot, which was his testimony, Mr. Bostick's testimony; or by simply being talked to, which was the officer's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.753" offset="6716049">That occurred at a time when Officer Nutt was standing, I think by the undisputed testimony, half in and half out of the aisle in front of Mr. Bostick.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.514" offset="6763069">That is to say, half in and half out of an aisle which is about 15 inches wide according to fact-finding in U.S. v. Chandler here in the District of Columbia that is relating to a Greyhound bus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.729" offset="6808000">Officer Rubino, it is not quite clear where he was, but he was apparently in the row also directly in front of Mr. Bostick.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.944" offset="6844780">So the two of them were confronting Mr. Bostick very directly.</text>

            <text syncTime="1687.565" offset="6883337">It is not clear what more they said than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.611" offset="6891487">They asked where Mr. Bostick where he was traveling to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.501" offset="6903085">He said Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.702" offset="6907892">They asked to see his ticket and his identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.591" offset="6919386">He presented them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.982" offset="6924924">They were in order and the names matched so they were given back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.372" offset="6934537">And immediately thereafter, apparently, Mr. Bostick was asked if he would consent to a search of the red bag which didn't belong to him, and then subsequently would consent to a search of the blue bag which did.</text>

            <text syncTime="1881.378" offset="7658547">And I would state the legal test roughly as follows, trying to incorporate this Court's thinking in a series of cases: Mendenhall and Delgado.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.918" offset="7704731">But also in the more recent opinion in Inyo v. Broward County, it seems to me the question is something like this: Whether intentional police conduct, in the setting in which it plainly is occurring, that is on a bus, communicated to a reasonable person, by which I mean an innocent person, that he is not free to leave the presence of the officer, assuming that he would want to leave the presence of the officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.501" offset="7815072">And I would argue, based on the facts that I just reviewed that a reasonable person here would plainly feel that he had been and was being temporarily detained for the purpose of being questioned by these officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2014.166" offset="8189668">And that is why, in stating the tests that I have stated, I have put it in terms of the intentional police conduct and its effect, in the setting, on a person, assuming the person decides he wants to leave.</text>

            <text syncTime="2077.891" offset="8444623">They are irrelevant to the question of whether he is free to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.812" offset="8452251">Nonetheless, well, let me come back to the question of whether they are relevant at all to the Fourth Amendment issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.228" offset="8485897">But specifically, the confinement that results here, I think results from three different sort of collections of factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.070" offset="8525289">And I would enumerate them as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.616" offset="8531454">First of all, obvious physical confinement within the bus, that is to say, the bus itself is a very small area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.847" offset="8564473">There are very few ways to move about on a bus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.222" offset="8573877">You don't have just much room to get around.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.642" offset="8583595">There is one exit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.673" offset="8591745">It is at the front of the bus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.329" offset="8598328">And in this case, the officer was half in the aisle which is 15 inches wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.514" offset="8615046">The door to the bus is closed, and there is another officer standing, right, practically in his face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.011" offset="8637094">So you have, number one, these factors of physical confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.291" offset="8650155">Number two, you have police officers who are making apparent, that is to say they are communicating by their actions, their ability to use force if they need to do it or believe it is appropriate to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.646" offset="8703654">That is to say, they are displaying in a visible form, not to say, out of its purse, but nonetheless in a visible form, they are making observers aware that they have a weapon handy if they need it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.391" offset="8750569">And they are wearing raid jackets, which I think most people are familiar with from watching television, as garments that are worn by law enforcement officers when the officers are most typically engaged in arresting people and carrying out somewhat urgent law enforcement activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.884" offset="8812532">So they have the garb and the outward dress of readiness for action, that is the second factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.506" offset="8835102">And the third, which I think may be perhaps the most important of all is the apparent purposefulness of their behavior by virtue of several specific aspects of what went on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.455" offset="8894870">A couple of them are minor, I think, sounding, but when you put them together, become more significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.765" offset="8916081">The touching on the foot, a sort of an indication, you know, if you spell it out... you may want to rest, but we want to talk to you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2435.418" offset="9874671">It rather bears upon how a reasonable person would interpret it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.573" offset="9891285">If you were sitting in a restaurant and an officer came into the restaurant in uniform, which he obviously would have a perfect right to do, and he came directly to your table, and he addressed you and asked you for your driver's license, the assumption that I think most people would make would be that the officer was there in order to carry out some specific, purposeful mission that the officer needed to carry out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.406" offset="10002671">One wouldn't be, I think, necessarily totally pleased because one might have the impression that one had become some sort of a target of inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.824" offset="10036316">And I think that same kind of reasoning transfers over here, where you are talking about, say a bus or an airplane or a train, a situation where I think most people generally expect that they are not going to be approached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.692" offset="10107787">If they are going to be approached, I will put it this way, it is going to be for some reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.379" offset="10122520">Now again, that doesn't mean that the officers can't ever do it, and I don't argue that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.391" offset="10142583">I am simply arguing now, what would a reasonable person conclude from this event occurring?</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.748" offset="10164003">And my suggestion is that a reasonable person would conclude that the officer was about some business, very purposeful business; and the officer in this case, both blocking the way out, displaying force and an ability to use force, communicates a sense of an intention to accomplish the mission that he was about.</text>

            <text syncTime="2705.358" offset="10954468">It seems to us perfectly clear that the judgment must be made on the basis of all the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.368" offset="10982471">And the circumstances here I think really do break into two categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.258" offset="11002116">There are the peculiar, aggravating circumstances that I think fairly can be said are unmatched in any of the later cases that you find either in the Federal courts or the State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.410" offset="11046628">The factors relating to the display of this gun, in the pouch visible and recognizable as a gun; the blocking of the aisle that is half way in, half way out of the aisle; the fact that the door to the bus is closed throughout this encounter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.029" offset="11105143">How would a person get off the bus if he wanted to?</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.340" offset="11114442">Those are unique facts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.698" offset="11123846">I think everything I have just said is utterly undisputed on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.197" offset="11137848">There is no dispute that those are the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.899" offset="11148610">And on those facts, it seems to me, it is very hard to say that there was not a confinement, especially when you look at the second category of facts which I would describe as the generic facts, the generic bus search facts, which I think frankly raise very serious problems, questions about whether there is a seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.452" offset="11234814">But by no means, is every bus search without reasonable suspicion, going to involve a seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.091" offset="11257384">Again, just to repeat that generic set of facts includes, as Justice Kennedy noted, it includes the fact that you have got a busload of passengers who basically don't want to get off, and the police are taking advantage of that desire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.774" offset="11312137">Maybe they have their luggage under the bus in the storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.101" offset="11321436">Maybe they have given up their ticket.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.085" offset="11325407">Maybe they can't afford to stay overnight in FtLauderdale, lots of reasons they don't want to get off and the police are saying, we have sort of a captive audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.880" offset="11352574">I think that is a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.113" offset="11357485">But the bigger problem is the fact that people on a bus, like people on an airplane, like people in church, like people in a restaurant, think if an officer comes on board or comes into the restaurant and comes up to them and focuses on them and doesn't say, this is just routine or you don't have to talk to me or something that contradicts the inference of the situation, something that says, relax, we are not after you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.821" offset="11468349">This is just a routine conversation we are having.</text>

            <text syncTime="2909.962" offset="11772832">And I think where you have an entire factory to move around in, it is a far different circumstance than where you simply have no where to go at all to get away from the presence of the officer, and you are relying entirely, as the other side has argued in their brief is enough, you are relying entirely on the willingness of the officer to walk away from you because you can't go anywhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="2948.368" offset="11926537">So to be sure, he may only be able to move three seats away, but so long as he can move three seats away and there is no force or threat of force that prevents him from moving that distance or further, I don't see why it is an arrest, why it is a seizure.</text>
