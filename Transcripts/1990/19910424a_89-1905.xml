            <text syncTime="171.452" offset="814784">Third, the ordinance is expressly aimed at protecting private property, drinking water wells, and other areas open to the public, like lakes and streams, hunting grounds, play and recreation areas, and public rights of way.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.902" offset="868596">Fourth, the Town of Casey ordinance is a permit ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.923" offset="884687">It permits pesticide use under certain circumstances and it allows the town board to impose reasonable conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.948" offset="912795">For example, it can prevent spraying under windy conditions or it can create buffer zones around play areas or school grounds to protect children.</text>

            <text syncTime="933.550" offset="3863169">And it is no small matter to conclude that Congress decided by implication comprehensively to preclude local units of government from any regulation of the use of these poisons in the community in order to protect against contamination of wellhead and other drinking waters and against other dangers to the health or safety of persons or animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.810" offset="3984168">It is our view that Congress did not make that determination, even though some members of Congress expressed a preference for that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.780" offset="4036099">It is equally our view that nothing in FIFRA precludes a State as a matter of State law from determining that local governments should be precluded and that all State regulation of pesticides should be centralized in a State agency, or as California prefers in the brief that it submitted, joined by some other States, that local units be enlisted only in aiding in the administration of State laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="1779.575" offset="7247280">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.244" offset="7297957">The circuit court of Washburn County, Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Supreme Court found the pesticide regulation enacted by the Town of Casey to be preempted by Federal law, and in asking this Court to uphold these State court decisions, I urge this Court to consider three key factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.636" offset="7371518">First, the statutory language and the legislative history of FIFRA demonstrate a clear congressional intent to preempt local regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.352" offset="7414359">Congress expressly considered but rejected local regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.515" offset="7435048">Second, Congress created a Federal/State scheme which is responsive to Federal, State, and local needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.153" offset="7469530">And it did so because Congress recognized that pesticide regulation is more than simply a local concern and must be subject to Federal and State control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.397" offset="7506519">But that scheme also allowed... also allows local needs to be addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.232" offset="7525850">And the third point I would like to emphasize as I begin this morning is that the Town of Casey ordinance, the ordinance before the Court, is an extraordinarily broad ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.188" offset="7569735">It creates a comprehensive permitting program which is totally independent of any State or Federal program.</text>

            <text syncTime="2345.435" offset="9510738">In that legislative scheme, States may do a number of things other than regulate pesticide use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.069" offset="9541249">They may issue experimental use permits, certify pesticide applicators, obtain exemptions for emergency conditions, and exercise primary enforcement authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="3218.858" offset="13004354">And it really... it serves to provide a Statewide perspective so that some of the most parochial problems can be then vetoed by the State effectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.657" offset="13051584">So it's that State control which we think is key here, and what Congress was intending to do as it set forth in the statute and the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.853" offset="13092335">I would like to highlight again and perhaps clarify some of our earlier comments with respect to the conflict issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.000" offset="13132981">And I believe that the conflict that we're talking about with respect to this ordinance is not necessarily... although it could be an impossibility-type conflict where the Federal Government says X and the local unit of government is saying Y.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.829" offset="13192331">Our concern with this type of ordinance is much more in that it frustrates the Federal scheme in several respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.704" offset="13223783">The Federal scheme was designed to provide coordination and cooperation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.938" offset="13240710">This ordinance, which requires... which establishes an independent regulatory scheme, operates wholly outside of any State program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.744" offset="13279894">If this particular ordinance was allowed to stand, local units of government would be free to enact whatever they want, and the goal of coordination would be lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.800" offset="13320122">Second, I think that this type of ordinance presents the same type of problems with effective use of pesticides that we've talked about earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.706" offset="13363799">There is a problem of parochialization, that the local units of government concerned with their own narrow interests may inadvertently be ignoring the larger State or regional interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.696" offset="13407789">And as a practical matter, having this type of ordinance by a unit of government with the least technical resources we believe thwarts the congressional purpose that there by effective pesticide regulation managed by those units of government which can bring the effective and efficient regulation of pesticides to bear, to have the technical resources to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.861" offset="13516459">That if this ordinance is allowed to stand, where the conflict arises, then, is in a case where you then have the burgeoning of literally tens of thousands of these types of local ordinances where you would have one jurisdiction requiring a permit for 60 days prior to use, as the Town of Casey has done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.744" offset="13599946">Then in the next township, 6 miles down the road there's not a permitting scheme, but there is a very elaborate notice and posting scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.940" offset="13628681">And then the next 6 miles down the road, you have another type of ordinance that, say, perhaps requires a review of the pesticide re-registration process or something on that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.439" offset="13678731">Congress among other things in its concern with coordination, was also concerned about burdens on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.964" offset="13704854">And I think many of the amicus parties which have filed briefs here today have highlighted those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.065" offset="13721259">And to just give you one example of where that could be a problem, I would submit the utility rights of way or rail corridor problem is an excellent example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.500" offset="13755009">A railroad or a rural electric cooperative in northern Wisconsin which crosses several hundred miles would have to submit to regulations... a different set of regulations every 6 miles as it goes across the State under this type of ordinance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3445.607" offset="13911430">--Right, considerably more restrictive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.437" offset="13918744">And again our concern here ultimately is with the multiplicity of these types of regulations could effectively preclude any use of pesticides by these governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.395" offset="13966496">In concluding, I would just like to note that congressional intent we believe remains the ultimate touchstone here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.501" offset="13994917">And we believe Congress established a coordinated Federal and State program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.563" offset="14015188">And it provided that States can regulate use and defines States to preclude local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.886" offset="14036504">It underscored the different roles between States and local governments, allowing States to cooperate and participate in those State programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.612" offset="14071404">And I think as the words of the statute say, in carrying out the provisions of this chapter, they can assist in a State program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.569" offset="14107244">But they cannot we submit under this statute and this legislative history be involved in a case where they can do so wholly independent and without regard to the State program or the Federal program.</text>

            <text syncTime="3515.952" offset="14192821">First, I'd like to come back to a question that Justice Souter raised regarding Senator Allen's activity on the floor of the Senate, and I may have misspoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.129" offset="14229497">I want to refer the Court to the Solicitor General's brief on page 20 in which it makes very clear exactly what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.832" offset="14260321">There Senator Allen inserted an explanation of the bill as it appeared in the original report of the Committee of Agriculture and Forestry, which included that paragraph concerning the authority of local governments from the initial report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.584" offset="14319254">Thus, he did not read it into the record while on the Senate floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.457" offset="14338793">And the fact is that the Senate... the dispute that existed between the Senate Agriculture and Forestry Committees as well as the Commerce Committee was never resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.493" offset="14374947">That dispute was never resolved in the passage of this act.</text>
