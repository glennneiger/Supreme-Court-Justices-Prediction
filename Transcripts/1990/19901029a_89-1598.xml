            <text syncTime="57.258" offset="360538">This case arises from an accident as defined by the Warsaw Convention that occurred aboard Eastern Airlines flight number 855 while in route from Miami to Nassau in the Bahamas.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.847" offset="410902">As flight 855 approached Nassau, the flight crew noticed a low oil pressure indication on one of the Lockheed 1011's three engines.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.294" offset="456773">They shut down that engine and began a return to Miami.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.657" offset="470148">In route the other two engines of the aircraft quit because of oil starvation.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.251" offset="492509">After a period of unpowered flight, the crew restarted the engine originally shut down and was able to effect a safe landing at the Miami International Airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.298" offset="532737">None of the passengers in these cases suffered any physical injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.430" offset="553217">Because the crew issued appropriate warnings to the passengers including ditching instructions, safety instructions, and ultimately a notice that ditching is imminent, it's undisputed that some of these passengers suffered fright.</text>

            <text syncTime="168.112" offset="803993">And the reason it's not is because Eastern's liability is governed by the provisions of the Warsaw Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.244" offset="828548">Specifically article 17 of the Convention provides that the carrier shall be liable.</text>
