            <text syncTime="23.167" offset="219332">Arkansas law provides for gross receipts tax of general applicability to sales of all tangible personal property in Arkansas in certain services.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.145" offset="267293">The law also provides for certain enumerated exceptions, one being an exception for sale of newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.819" offset="298013">The... since 1987 the tax has been applied to sale of cable television services, and in 1989 the gross receipts tax law was amended to add to the sales tax the service of descrambling of satellite services provided to home dish owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.873" offset="390173">The same general gross receipts tax is applied to many businesses, like cable TV service, that being home video rentals, books, magazines, admission to sporting events.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.138" offset="475227">The respondents in this case, who are the petitioners in 90-39, have challenged the Arkansas tax because an exemption, as is extended to newspapers, is not also extended to the sale of cable television service, citing that there is a similarity between the two services.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.394" offset="576269">The law does not in fact violate the First Amendment for the reason that cable television service is a distinguishable medium from the newspapers.</text>

            <text syncTime="137.412" offset="676370">It's just that the ability to tax one of the medium, one of the media is not necessarily binding the State to tax the other medium in the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.399" offset="724331">The tax involved does not single out the press, nor is it content based.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eugene G. Sayre</label>
            <text syncTime="1450.989" offset="5930640">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.168" offset="5975361">I would like to first state the theory of the case on behalf of the operators and subscribers to summarize the relief that we seek and then to discuss the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.485" offset="6024681">First, the theory is, as enunciated in this Court's Minneapolis Star case, that if we have a differential of taxation between different forms of the media, then, even though the Court said that it does not in essence make such a compelling force on the speaker that it totally keeps them from speaking at the time, that that presence and the threat of future differential taxation is such that it puts a burden on the State to show a higher or the compelling interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.650" offset="6177340">And in this particular case we believe that the taxpayers and the cable operators have sufficiently established that the method of delivering news information and entertainment by the cable electronic message is exactly the same as that that is delivered in the print, either newspapers or magazines, and in fact the trial court stated that our witnesses referred to this as an electronic magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.370" offset="6300220">Now the method, or the relief that we're seeking is a reversal of the latter part of the decision and an affirmance of the first part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.527" offset="6344837">As Mr. Keadle said, the Arkansas Supreme... legislature amended the law because we had established at the trial in this case that the direct broadcast satellite, or the scrambled services, were not being taxed and were delivering exactly the same type of information, news and entertainment, virtually identical, to the cable that was taxed, that for that 2-year period the tax was unconstitutional under this Court's Minneapolis Star and Arkansas Writer's Project rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.129" offset="6475241">However, we have never had an opportunity in the second stage of the case to present any evidence to attack that, because it was after the trial court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.085" offset="6519022">We believe if this Court will accept the broader approach that we have suggested, and that is that print and the cable are similar, sufficiently similar, that the same tax should be applied to the same or they are unconstitutional without a compelling interest being shown by the State, then you should reverse the Arkansas Supreme Court on the approval of the second or amended law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.575" offset="6624974">However, even if you find that only the electronic media is similar and that we should narrow the approach or the look to those particular entities, we have submitted the affidavits in the petition for rehearing simply to establish that there is a factual difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.496" offset="6692684">The Supreme Court of Arkansas noted twice in the opinion that the Act 769 was not before the trial court, and did not pass upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.310" offset="6723926">And therefore we submit that even if the Court should narrow the limitation of the view in this case, that we should be entitled on remand... the Court should vacate and we should be entitled on remand to present evidence on the amended statute either in this case on remand or in another case without the threat of collateral estoppel or res judicata being raised.</text>

            <text syncTime="3413.762" offset="13781794">In conclusion I would state that the Arkansas tax in both instances is not violative of the First Amendment due to the fact that it does not single out the press for special treatment, special tax treatment.</text>
