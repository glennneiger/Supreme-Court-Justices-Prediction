            <text syncTime="30.957" offset="245131">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="35.018" offset="261327">The principal issue in this case is whether an Indian tribe can sue a State without its consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.327" offset="286614">This Court has upheld unconsented waivers of State sovereign immunity in only two discrete circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.622" offset="311796">First, either the United States or another State can sue a State, because those suits, this Court has declared, are essential to the plan of the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.994" offset="353278">And second, Congress, by statute can abrogate the State sovereign immunity so long as there is a clear textual statement that Congress really intended to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.427" offset="390999">The effort to show that suits against States by Indian tribes are either essential to the plan of the convention or that they have been approved by clear textual statement by Congress will not withstand scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.843" offset="440632">With respect to what is essential to the plan of the convention, quite unlike the United States and the States, neither foreign governments nor Indian tribes figured in the various compromises and other arrangements of which that convention consisted.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.291" offset="502385">The major players in the convention's plan were, of course, the States themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.430" offset="518999">It was their surrender of sovereign prerogatives that brought into existence the new Constitution and the new republic, the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.316" offset="554526">All sides agree that, as stated very well by my opponents, there is not a shred of evidence that the ability of the Indian tribes to sue the States was even remotely in view during that time of the Constitutional Convention.</text>

            <text syncTime="132.104" offset="649716">When the petition for certiorari was filed it included a third question, asking whether Federal question jurisdiction was... whether it exists, a point that was addressed by Judge Kozinski in his dissent below.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.735" offset="736233">Now in your brief on the merits I see that that isn't even addressed.</text>

            <text syncTime="165.137" offset="781791">We are not giving up the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.370" offset="790777">A tactical judgment was made along the line not to address it.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.321" offset="806555">We would welcome a victory on either ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.181" offset="817944">On the merits, we agree completely with what Judge Kozinski had to say, that there is no substantial Federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.224" offset="842186">The only point on which we disagree with Judge Kozinski is which is the easier ground, on which--</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="186.706" offset="868100">Is injunctive relief sought here?</text>
            <text syncTime="190.533" offset="883355">And if so, even if you were right on the Eleventh Amendment point, is there something left?</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="196.717" offset="908119">--We think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.998" offset="913239">And the reason is that the only injunctive relief has to do with what has happened, what would happen in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.104" offset="949706">That, of course, is governed by a 1985 statute that is passed by the Alaska legislature, and I just can't see any possible way that anyone can take the position that Federal law, Fourteenth Amendment or otherwise, prohibits a State from lengthening the list of possible recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.285" offset="1014385">Now I realize that that also goes to the very question that you're asking, which is the substantial Federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.847" offset="1036642">The only reason that we feel that the easier, the cleaner, and the better ground for reversal of the Ninth Circuit's judgment is sovereign immunity rather than the substantial Federal question... and both of them of course are jurisdictional... is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.979" offset="1097141">The first is that, has to do with the respective burdens that are imposed by those two doctrines.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.508" offset="1123264">On the one hand, under Hagans v. Lavine and Bell v. Hood and others, the burden is on us at this stage of the game to show that the Federal question is so attenuated as to be obviously frivolous, whereas the Court has made it quite clear, as I'd like to explain in just a moment, that the burden of establishing that sovereign immunity does not exist is, of course, on the respondents, and that is a similarly heavy one.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.811" offset="1224514">The second reason is, pertains really to the Court's considerations and ours as well, and that is that if the case is decided on Hagans v. Lavine grounds, that it becomes a rather inconsequential footnote, Hagans v. Lavine, that makes no difference to anyone in this courtroom, whereas the sovereign immunity issue involves a conflict in the circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.816" offset="1324511">It's one that affects my clients very deeply.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.253" offset="1334229">It... the two circuits involved are two major Indian population circuits and that need to be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.328" offset="1362545">So that while a victory on either ground would not be unwelcome, we would urge the Court to concentrate on the court's... on the Ninth Circuit's sovereign immunity error.</text>

            <text syncTime="350.764" offset="1524295">The issue here is whether a sufficiently compelling case can be made to overcome the sovereign immunity bar, and that burden, as I mentioned just a moment ago, is on the respondents and not on the petitioners.</text>

            <text syncTime="379.707" offset="1640070">Probably the best statement of that, incidentally, appears in the brief of the Academy for State and Local Governments that, really, sovereign immunity of both the United States and the states did preexist the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.903" offset="1700883">I would just ask in this respect that you consider the anomaly that would result if the Ninth Circuit's judgment remains the law, because it would mean that Indian tribes who were not participants in either the convention nor the Eleventh Amendment proceedings would be able to sue the States, but that States who were participants and who ceded powers were what made the convention possible could not sue tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.533" offset="1815404">And surely no one can say with a straight face that that kind of result was part of the plan of the convention.</text>

            <text syncTime="472.981" offset="2013203">The argument that the... probably the principal argument on which the Ninth Circuit relies, indeed it's whole opinion rests on the foundation, that the naked Indian Commerce Clause, in the absence of any affirmative congressional enactment, somehow waives the State sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.316" offset="2090526">That argument proves too much, and it does so along two separate dimensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.189" offset="2114036">First, if the unexercised congressional power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, with the various States, with the several States, and among the Indian tribes, waives State sovereign immunity in all suits brought by Indian tribes, then why not also in suits brought by plaintiffs in the other two constitutionally recognized commercial categories, namely--</text>

            <text syncTime="531.754" offset="2248305">And not only Monaco v. Mississippi, but also State commercial plaintiffs, interstate commercial plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.064" offset="2273487">Similarly, if the bare existence of congressional law-making power waives immunity, then why is there not also a waiver in all suits brought against States by plaintiffs in bankruptcy cases, in patent cases, and in admiralty cases?</text>
            <text syncTime="557.447" offset="2351019">Second, and even more important, it is now well established that Congress will not be assumed to have waived sovereign immunity... waived the State's sovereign immunity unless there is a clear textual statement to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.596" offset="2411623">Surely the law cannot be otherwise where Congress simply has the authority to act but has not done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.422" offset="2438999">It makes no sense at all to say that something less than a clear congressional textual statement will not suffice, but that no statement at all will.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.652" offset="2487900">And this brings us to the argument that Congress, by enacting 28 U.S.C. Section 1362, has satisfied the clear statement rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.414" offset="2526875">Not even the Ninth Circuit agrees with that proposition, and even a casual examination of the statute reveals why.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.723" offset="2552162">Section 1362 just is not a statute that deals in any way with sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.143" offset="2577866">It is solely a jurisdictional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.502" offset="2587270">It does not even mention States.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.172" offset="2593958">It does not even mention sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.124" offset="2601794">There is no statement at all, clear, textual, or any other.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.639" offset="2619767">The respondents appear to recognize as much, and their strongest argument with respect to 1362 is that the clear statement rule should not apply for any statute that was adopted between 1964, when pardon came down, and about the mid-1980's, when this Court in a series of cases... probably Pennhurst, too, but clearly Atascadero, Welch, and Dellmuth... laid down the clear statement rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.455" offset="2735123">Aside from its inherent illogic, and I submit that it is inherently illogical, that same argument would necessarily apply to a statute that was adopted in 1973, the date of enactment of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which was at issue in Atascadero, or in 1975, which was the date of the Education of the Handicapped Act, which was the statute involved in Dellmuth.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.021" offset="2853301">Indeed, the very argument that the respondents make here in that respect, that you ought to have one constitutional rule applicable for one 20-year period and another one for all else in history, was expressly made, addressed, and rejected in this Court's most recent pronouncement in this area, which is Dellmuth v. Muth.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.669" offset="2943894">After first observing the unlikelihood that what Congress was really doing in the Education of the Handicapped Act was just trying to draw coy little hints, and that's the Court's language, about the meaning of the Eleventh Amendment, the Court then goes on to say this The salient point, in our view, is that it cannot be said with perfect confidence that Congress in fact intended in 1975 to abrogate sovereign immunity, and imperfect confidence will not suffice, given the special constitutional concerns in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.762" offset="3108256">That statement, which is a correct statement of the law, applies just as much to a 1966 statute as it does to a 1973 statute, and the respondents argument here comes 2 years too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.631" offset="3167815">We're told, however, that Indian tribes should be able to sue the States because the United States could bring the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.033" offset="3197386">The right of the United States to bring these suits on the Indians' behalf cuts solidly in favor of sovereign immunity, and not against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.421" offset="3234898">One of the firmest pillars of our Eleventh Amendment, and generally sovereign immunity jurisprudence, is that it is a constitutional right; it will not be lightly abrogated.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.933" offset="3277007">But the Federal Government does have the right to abrogate it, and it can do so in either of two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.303" offset="3306473">First of all, Congress can abrogate, so long as it passes a statute that clearly says right in the text that Congress intended to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.472" offset="3343149">And the other way that the Federal Government can abrogate it is by the executive branch bringing suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.892" offset="3364779">What these plaintiffs are really asking for is a rule that would set aside sovereign immunity in those cases where the Federal Government has not made, where the United States has not made the necessary judgment call that suit against a State is warranted, given the intrusion that... by one sovereign of the prerogatives of another, that such suits necessarily--</text>

            <text syncTime="906.307" offset="3746480">Similarly unpersuasive is the contention, for reasons that were alluded to just a moment ago by the Chief Justice, that sovereign immunity applies only to suits by individuals and not governments, assuming for the moment that you can... that these respondents qualify as governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.548" offset="3819414">And that, of course, is squarely rejected by the holding in Monaco v. Mississippi, which the respondents concede.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.046" offset="3849402">But they have an explanation for Monaco v. Mississippi, and it is that there was a subterfuge involved in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.386" offset="3882839">The assignment of the confederate State bonds by the individual holders to a government.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.227" offset="3906140">The individuals couldn't bring the suit, but they assigned them to a government so that the government could.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.162" offset="3937905">There are two problems with that, with that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.677" offset="3952011">First is that the court simply didn't rely on that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.033" offset="3973432">And the second is that once again it proves too much because that identical circumstance, assignment of confederate State bonds by their individual holders to a State, was precisely what was at issue in the leading case standing for the proposition that a State can sue another State, namely South Dakota v. North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.369" offset="4050754">And indeed in South Dakota v. North Carolina that very argument was made and rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.164" offset="4081892">The real difference, I submit, is not whether it's an individual or a government.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.129" offset="4105820">The only difference that really matters is what was in the plan of the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.424" offset="4122957">The States and the Federal Government were the participants in the convention, so that suits by either of them are essential to the convention's plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.108" offset="4157647">Now, if the Court agrees with our position concerning sovereign immunity, then it need never reach the question that the more I get into it the more I can see that it is complex and difficult and would have farranging consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.895" offset="4264854">And that is if you assume that there is some entity that is Indian related that can sue a State, how do you determine who those Indian-related entities are?</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.186" offset="4306023">The one thing that is clear is that the Ninth Circuit's rule on this issue just cannot be the law, because what that court has done is to take two other statutes whose coverage and definition include far more than just tribes and whose purposes have nothing to do with either sovereign immunity or Section 1362, and declare that any group of natives covered by either the Indian Reorganization Act or the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act automatically have all State sovereign immunity defenses waived in their favor in any suit they bring against the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.030" offset="4469340">It would mean, for example, that native-owned fishermen's cooperatives, purely commercial ventures, or I would assume, residential neighborhood watch associations composed of native members could sue the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.475" offset="4551156">The reason is that the Indian Reorganization Act, which is one of the incorporation by reference statutes that the Ninth Circuit used, extends not just to tribes but also to... and I'm quoting... groups... groups having a common bond of occupation or association or residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.873" offset="4636733">You're led to the conclusion that Judge Kozinski's footnote on this issue is probably right, that it extends to... that any group of natives that has any kind of... that has a Native American membership and has any common bond of association has Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity waived in suits brought by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.846" offset="4736625">Finally, and perhaps worst of all, the Ninth Circuit's rule would make a shambles of existing sovereign immunity principles for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.717" offset="4772152">You start from the proposition, and even the Ninth Circuit agrees with this, that Section 1362 does not waive sovereign immunity, and yet you end up in a rule... with a rule that for a group of plaintiffs far broader, far broader than those identified by 1362, sovereign immunity is waived as to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1203.216" offset="4934111">Alaska and amicus States tell us that if tribes are permitted to sue the States directly it will upset the constitutional plan, endanger the States' treasuries, and violate the fundamental principle that sovereign States can't be sued without their consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.834" offset="5008612">The States imply that there may be many cases pending if this Court should open the floodgates to direct tribal suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.940" offset="5041004">The facts are otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.330" offset="5050617">It has been over 14 years since this Court decided Moe v.

            <text syncTime="1249.698" offset="5120103">And none of those nine have apparently been so damaging to the State treasuries that a single State has bothered to go back to Congress and seek their reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.116" offset="5161690">Nor can it be accurately stated that permitting direct tribal suits would upset the constitutional balance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1325.855" offset="5424691">It would not upset the constitutional balance for the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.494" offset="5443185">First, the States consented to be sued on direct tribal claims inherently in the constitutional plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.975" offset="5477144">In U.S. v. Texas and South Dakota v. North Carolina this Court held that a Federal forum for the peaceful resolution of Federal-State and State-State suits was essential to the peace and permanence of the Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.249" offset="5546212">At the time the Constitution was adopted the threat of Indian wars was far more eminent and critical than wars between the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.995" offset="5581216">Recall that during the Articles of the Confederation numerous wars had occurred, the Federalist Papers tell us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.118" offset="5609742">And numerous lives had been slaughtered, Madison tells us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.398" offset="5626878">Recall that on the eve of the convention Georgia had invaded Creek territory and attempted to set up counties, and that North Carolina had intruded on the Cherokees and the Choctaws, and they were hostile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.299" offset="5678496">And New York had intruded on the Iroquois, and they were hostile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.187" offset="5698036">The historians tell us that the reason Georgia so rapidly ratified the Constitution was to get Federal defense in case the Creeks attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.370" offset="5738787">And that's the way it was when the Constitution was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.244" offset="5754251">If, therefore, a Federal forum was so essential to keep the peace of the Nation in the case of U.S. State and State-State suits, far more so was such a forum necessary to keep the peace in tribal-State disputes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1438.966" offset="5877131">And George Washington, recall, was the president of the constitutional convention, the lead framer, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.869" offset="5900746">And when in 1790, just 1 year after the Constitution was adopted, he gave a speech to Corn Planter, Chief of the Senecas, he said if your rights have been violated under the Indian Non-Intercourse Act either by individuals or States, he said,</text>

            <text syncTime="1675.620" offset="6823704">Now, if Federal court jurisdiction is strictly limited to... and party based to the United States, they should have never been permitted to intervene.</text>

            <text syncTime="2525.763" offset="10224325">The State says that Monaco v. Mississippi bars tribal suits, but the Court's rationale for barring suits by foreign countries simply doesn't apply to governments within the constitutional structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.288" offset="10278451">Suits by foreign nations, the Court said, could involve international law questions and foreign relations, whereas tribal-State suits and State-State suits could not involve international relations, because both the States and the tribes were divested of their foreign relations authority, the States by delegating it to the United States, the tribes by... as a result of their dependent status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.450" offset="10371029">In fact in Hans v. Louisiana this Court held that Federal court jurisdiction over State-State disputes was, quote, "necessary" because of the extinguishment of diplomatic relations between the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.164" offset="10421915">The precise same rationale applies to tribal-State disputes, because their diplomatic relations were extinguished in the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2667.939" offset="10793063">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.361" offset="10794735">It's true that Moe involved the anti-injunction act rather than the Eleventh Amendment, but they are both broad jurisdictional barriers and both their purposes are identical: to protect the State treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.965" offset="10853144">Indeed this Court has called the taxing power the lifeblood of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.057" offset="10869445">Nonetheless, you overrode the anti-injunction act and permitted tribes to sue, because you said the Government could sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.913" offset="10896926">But even if 1362 as construed in Moe does not satisfy the clear statement rule, we submit that rule is simply inapplicable to 1362 for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.798" offset="10956485">This case is distinguishable from every other clear statement case you have had because in none of them had this Court previously construed the statute in question to permit suits against States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.729" offset="11012178">The purpose of the clear statement rule, after all, is to determine congressional intent, and this is what the Court already did in Moe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.946" offset="11041017">To reinterpret 1362 now by applying the clear statement rule and reach a different result would be anomalous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.520" offset="11079365">To construe a statute one way when one defense is raised... the anti-injunction act, and construe the identical statute a different way when a different defense is raised... the Eleventh Amendment, would put the meaning of the act in the hands of the defendant rather than the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.434" offset="11146970">Moreover, reinterpretation of 1362 is particularly unjustified here, where Congress has had 14 years to reverse the Court's construction of Moe and hasn't seen fit to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.008" offset="11201304">Finally, under the contemporary legal context doctrine the Court will engage in the presumption that Congress knows the law, is familiar with this Court's precedents, and will draft its legislation to conform with the rules of construction this Court has laid down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.888" offset="11300779">In 1966, when 1362 was passed, the rule of construction for abrogating tribal sovereign immunity of this Court was pardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.525" offset="11339335">And the rule in pardon was that when a State statute on its face is broad enough to include States, the States are included and their sovereign immunity has been waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.363" offset="11386669">In short the rule in pardon is almost directly opposite of the clear statement rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.706" offset="11404119">Under pardon a State must be expressly excluded to avoid liability, whereas under the clear statement rule States must be expressly included to be held liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.716" offset="11448109">In pardon this Court refused to follow Justice White's four-justice dissent demanding a clear statement rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.542" offset="11479456">And that's the way it was 2 years later when 1362 was adopted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2861.079" offset="11565556">I have doubled checked that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.439" offset="11575064">This Court discussed the contemporary legal context doctrine in Dellmuth and implicitly approved of it while rejecting it, because the statute in question in Dellmuth was passed in 1975, whereas only 2 years earlier you had... you had come down with Employees v. Public Health Department which had foreshadowed the clear statement rule, and therefore Justice Kennedy for the Court said that the clear statement rule applied because Congress... was aware that it was on its way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.000" offset="11737233">In our case, however, the rule was pardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.202" offset="11750085">And this Court... I mean Congress couldn't have dreamed that the clear statement rule was required when this Court had just expressly rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.806" offset="11788433">For that reason, the clear statement rule should not be applicable, and 1362 should be construed as this Court construed it in Moe.</text>

            <text syncTime="2940.048" offset="11881429">I find nothing less than extraordinary the proposition that suits by tribes against States were built into the convention's plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.276" offset="11930330">All agree that no one was thinking about this particular issue at the time of the convention, and it just isn't enough under this Court's well-established jurisprudence to say that such a core governmental right will be set aside in any case where it can't be shown that someone at the convention didn't stand up and say, look, affirmatively, we're going to say that tribes can't sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.407" offset="12030849">That just is not the way the burden works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.625" offset="12039731">That's point number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.672" offset="12043910">Point number two is that my opponents have effectively conceded here in oral argument the same thing that they have effectively conceded in the briefs, that 1362 can't pass muster under the clear statement rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.274" offset="12114336">But neither Mr. Aschenbrenner nor anybody else has been able to come up with an answer to the obvious point that if his new rule were the law... that is, one constitutional standard for one 20-year period and other constitutional standard for any other period... it would have equally precluded the result in both Atascadero and Dellmuth.</text>
