            <text syncTime="52.326" offset="347241">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="56.607" offset="364273">This case involves a truthful statement to the media on a matter of public concern more than 6 months before a scheduled trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.676" offset="408577">For nearly a year before that statement, Las Vegas media portrayed Dominic Gentile's client, Grady Sanders, as a suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.901" offset="445461">They said Sanders was a key target.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.702" offset="456746">The police fed these stories.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.085" offset="466255">The police said that their officers had passed drug and polygraph tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.218" offset="486735">At joint appendix pages 43 through 45, Mr. Gentile tells us what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.592" offset="516306">He kept silent until there was an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.055" offset="530098">He kept silent until, at the first court appearance, a trial date was set that he then knew would be more than 6 months in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.389" offset="563430">The night before arraignment he went to the library and researched the law on what he could and could not say.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.726" offset="592792">Exhibit D in the hearing shows what he read, including, by the way, what was at that time the American Bar Association's inconsistent position, on the one hand the clear and present danger test, and on one hand the tendency test.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.943" offset="645664">In his presentation which is video taped and available to the Court and is in the appendix to the petition for certiorari, he stressed on at least five separate occasions that he was discussing what the evidence would show.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.293" offset="699058">He made no further press conference thereafter until--</text>

            <text syncTime="151.403" offset="743466">He thereafter remained silent until after the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.704" offset="756737">Neither the prosecutor nor the trial judge raised a complaint or sought a protective order.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.087" offset="774291">And at trial some 70 pages of voir dire transcript show that not one juror remembered the press statement.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael E. Tigar</label>
            <text syncTime="186.655" offset="884528">The burden rests on the State, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.468" offset="899783">In this particular trial, the cross examination of Government witnesses is... which of course defense counsel almost always does... always does in my experience... brought out the vital admission that these police officers were doing exactly what Mr. Gentile said they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.206" offset="962686">They were using narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.388" offset="967492">So it came out in that way in that case in addition to the defense evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.799" offset="985047">But it is important to stress that Mr. Gentile did not say anything at that conference which under any view of the trial would not be admissible in evidence, because what he was focusing on were the charges against his client and the fundamental defects in the Government's proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.182" offset="1050666">Now, at the hearing in this case based on these charges, they singled out six separate parts of the conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.668" offset="1084521">The bar counsel essentially introduced the statement and then rested.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.429" offset="1103643">The Nevada Supreme Court affirming said, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="245.052" offset="1118062">"The evidence demonstrated that there was no actual prejudice in this case. "</text>
            <text syncTime="249.674" offset="1136557">We are here, if the Court please, because the respondent has conjured for the Court a collision between the First and the Sixth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.091" offset="1174278">A collision that this Court has expressly on two occasions and consistently wisely refused to find, saying in the Nebraska Press case that the framers intended no hierarchy between First and Sixth Amendment rights, and saying, in Bridges v. California where this line of authority begins, that the Court will not make a forced choice between the First and the Sixth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.518" offset="1263930">The respondents conjure this collision by inviting the Court, we suggest, to ignore the working principles to which this Court referred at page 845 of its opinion in Landmark.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.353" offset="1307293">The principles founded, as the Court made clear at page 843 of that opinion, rest upon the clear and present danger test but did not require a mechanical application of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.990" offset="1345850">Now we want to look at these working principles, because they are a touchstone.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.553" offset="1372077">We submit that two ideas emerge.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.986" offset="1385870">The first is the formulation of a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.739" offset="1400812">We submit that before trials, lawyers and judges can in good faith sit down and fashion orders... not based upon imaginings, not at wholesale, but in light of concrete circumstances... orders that will restrain speech likely to have a clear and present danger to the trial process.</text>

            <text syncTime="336.892" offset="1485448">Well, Mr. Tigar, here we're dealing with, I suppose, Nevada Supreme Court rule 177.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.998" offset="1525886">And part 1 of that says that a lawyer shall not make an extra judicial statement if the lawyers knows or reasonably should know that it will have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.951" offset="1593700">Now, do you take the position that that provision is invalid as a matter of constitutional law?</text>

            <text syncTime="374.326" offset="1635182">We take that position because we agree with the American Bar Association, which doesn't support the outcome here but supports the rule, that it doesn't embody the clear and present danger standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.093" offset="1674261">And to that extent we say that violates what the Court said in Landmark.</text>

            <text syncTime="412.691" offset="1788678">And I think it is important to point out that this would not be the first time that the Court has had to say to the bar that the First Amendment doesn't stop short of its door.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.187" offset="1822637">Again, however, the problem, Justice O'Connor, is not simply a facial invalidity.</text>

            <text syncTime="430.323" offset="1859208">As the materials that Mr. Gentile consulted the night before that are in that Exhibit D point out, there is judicial disagreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="441.930" offset="1905602">The invalidity also appears, Justice O'Connor, from a reading of subparagraphs two and three, which in an attempt to clarify matters only add to the difficulties.</text>

            <text syncTime="2366.893" offset="9605455">They, too, recite the Procunier standard as... as enunciated in Seattle Times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.354" offset="9623323">If I can return, Justice O'Connor, to your question... these guidelines that are set out in the rule are really one of the great virtues of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.731" offset="9660835">Petitioner in his brief goes on at length trying to criticize these guidelines, but in fact this was an extraordinary effort of the bar over many years, guided in fact by this Court's decision in Sheppard against Maxwell, not only to set a substantial likelihood of prejudice standard but to do so in a way that lawyers will really understand what is permitted and what is not permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.027" offset="9749964">And indeed, I would refer this Court to page 28 of our brief, footnote 28, where we quote at length this Court's Sheppard v. Maxwell decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.283" offset="9794999">And the Court will see that many of the guidelines set out in part 2 of the rule were taken almost verbatim from Sheppard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.308" offset="9819137">By the same token, the third part of the rule is designed to provide a safe harbor to let a lawyer know that in certain circumstances he doesn't have to fear any possibility of discipline so long as he doesn't go outside of those... of those parameters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.109" offset="9886324">Now let me return to the implications of the standard that's urged by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.980" offset="9905863">It's interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.912" offset="9909520">As the argument is made in his brief, it's a clear and present danger press standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.644" offset="9928433">But as the argument has been made today, in response to virtually every difficult hypothetical that this Court could... could propose such as judges, such as court employees, Mr. Tigar ran from that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.132" offset="9978379">And we would submit as we said in our brief that if the clear and present danger Nebraska Press standard were held to apply to lawyers, you would ultimately have precisely what was indicated by that questioning and the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.299" offset="10023101">You'd have the dissolution of the Nebraska Press standard, because court would not want to hold officers of the court to the same standards that apply to the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.547" offset="10056119">The Nebraska Press standard, we submit, is entirely appropriate for the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.789" offset="10073047">It is necessary for a free and vigorous press.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.001" offset="10085899">But the standard, we would submit, has no application whatsoever in the context of lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.702" offset="10104707">Just to give a few examples to further the examples that... that Mr. Tigar has given, under the clear and present danger standard presumably, a defense lawyer could go out, call a press conference, and announce that he believes his client is guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.144" offset="10170431">As long as it's done before trial, he could do that and he could not be disciplined, cause all you'd need to do is conduct searching voir dire, have a change of venue or one of the other devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.221" offset="10206794">Now, no one would reasonably submit that it would be permissible for a lawyer in a situation like that to go out and announce to the press that his client is guilty.</text>
