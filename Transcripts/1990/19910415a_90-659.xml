            <text syncTime="14.871" offset="187106">The issue in this case is whether a plaintiff can maintain an action under section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 after ceasing to own any securities of the issuer on whose behalf the action was instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.361" offset="253039">Briefly stated, the facts are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.714" offset="270489">The respondent, then a shareholder of Viacom International, Inc., brought this action under section 16(b) against the petitioners in January of 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.122" offset="320121">In June of 1987 Viacom International was acquired in a merger transaction in which the respondent and other public shareholders of International received in exchange for their shares in International a combination of cash and a small amount of securities in the acquiring corporation, which became the parent company of Viacom International, which in turn became a wholly owned subsidiary of the new parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.993" offset="443524">The transaction was an arm's length transaction between independent parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.816" offset="462854">It was approved by stockholder vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.249" offset="476647">The petitioners had nothing to do with the merger either in form or the substance of the merger.</text>

            <text syncTime="106.193" offset="552402">I point it out because in the opinion of the court of appeals below there was some suggestion that there was something suspicious in the timing.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.738" offset="578524">In fact there was nothing suspicious in the timing.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.161" offset="588242">If the Court looks to the record in this case it is clear... nor has the respondent argued or alleged otherwise... that this merger was begun by a series of events including a leveraged buyout proposal made by the management long before this suit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.972" offset="659504">The merger was a culmination of those events.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.035" offset="667759">I point that out simply as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.439" offset="677372">The analysis of this case should begin with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.911" offset="703285">The statute says that an action may be instituted by the issuer or by the owner of any security of the issuer in the name and on behalf of the issuer.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.909" offset="747275">The statute does not state that a former owner of an issue or securities can sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.133" offset="772144">Indeed neither the SEC nor the respondent now seem to be saying that a former owner can sue in the first instance, although that--</text>

            <text syncTime="180.600" offset="849989">So all we have to resolve is whether it's now moot or he has lost standing?</text>
            <text syncTime="185.933" offset="871305">What is it?</text>

            <text syncTime="187.404" offset="877261">What the Court is... must resolve is whether a former shareholder, having commenced an action, loses standing when he ceases to be an owner of the securities of the issuer.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.922" offset="923236">The further contention is made in this case that... by the SEC and the respondent, that a former share owner may lose standing in some cases but somehow not in this case, because in this case the SEC takes the position and the respondent takes the position that because the shareholder, originally a shareholder of the issuer, has wound up a shareholder of the parent corporation, that an exception should be made to the statute to cover this particular set of affairs.</text>

            <text syncTime="234.475" offset="1065551">I mean, the language of the statute just says a... an act... a suit to recover such profit may be instituted by the owner of any security of the issuer.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.604" offset="1114035">Now, this suit was instituted by an owner of the security, was it not?</text>

            <text syncTime="251.899" offset="1135246">And that distinction now seems to have become, belatedly in this Court, the linchpin of the SEC's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.142" offset="1160219">In the court below that was not the distinction on which the SEC or any party relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.588" offset="1185924">But in any event, if taken literally, if you follow that position literally, what it would mean is that a shareholder can buy stock immediately before bringing an action, which he can now.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.634" offset="1230123">He can go to the clerk's office, file his complaint, call his broker on the way out of the clerk's office, and thereafter maintain his action and point to the words of the statute that said "may be instituted".</text>

            <text syncTime="299.022" offset="1323641">I think, Your Honor, the question of mootness might come into play in appropriate cases, but what we're dealing with is a question of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.289" offset="1360735">It's quite plain that section 16(b) does not intend, or was not intended by the Congress to go to the full length of the constitutional article III jurisdiction of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.098" offset="1403994">Congress didn't simply say what we have done is we have created a statute that said somebody could get inside the courthouse door, and whatever happens to him thereafter we're going to leave up to the courts to decide under constitutional mootness standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.376" offset="1453104">What the statute says is that a shareholder should be a shareholder of the issuer.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.370" offset="1473062">It was very plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.510" offset="1477659">And the question is did it... means to say thereafter anybody can continue suit so long as they maintain, no matter how indirect, an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.937" offset="1515380">For example, suppose the plaintiff in this case was a holder of some debt, not a security at all, but a creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.983" offset="1551533">I suppose... of the parent corporation, or suppose that we had a grandparent corporation, twice removed.</text>

            <text syncTime="364.299" offset="1584761">And the question that I think that the Court should not get itself into is going through the varieties of corporate forms in deciding that under certain circumstances a plaintiff should not lose standing--</text>

            <text syncTime="378.619" offset="1642126">The question in this case is whether a shareholder of a parent of a wholly-owned subsidiary continues to have standing when he did have standing at the time he instituted the suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="591.967" offset="2495494">If the SEC believed that the word instituted was all you needed to look at, then it wouldn't have had to adopt any such rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.912" offset="2523289">And indeed, in its 1989 rule proposal where it did include a requirement that a shareholder had brought the action before a merger resulted in the loss of his shares, the SEC only applied those proposed rules to a merger situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.365" offset="2593088">It didn't apply it to a situation where there was a reverse stock split.</text>

            <text syncTime="701.842" offset="2934978">It seems to me that Congress was recognizing that if the word "instituted" meant, in that instance, that you looked at the lawsuit, at the inception of it and forget about what happens thereafter, they would not have adopted any further terminology.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.352" offset="2989000">I think what the Congress is doing where it uses the word 36(b) of the Investment Company Act which the Court had before it in the Daily Income Fund against Fox case was another such example, although litigation has not arisen under it that raises this question.</text>

            <text syncTime="861.800" offset="3574769">This Court has recognized the statute is a strict liability statute, that it sometimes operates harshly.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.883" offset="3603086">Although it is aimed at preventing the misuse of inside information, in fact there is no inquiry into whether the defendant did abuse or use inside information.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.322" offset="3652928">It catches people who are not in fact insiders, never have been, such as my clients, in a particular company, because they meet a certain statutory threshold that is arbitrarily fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.191" offset="3696395">This Court has had a number of occasions to address the inflexibility and artificiality of some of the provisions of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.505" offset="3725653">In one of the early cases that this Court has had, Blau against Lehman, Lehman Brothers was regularly trading the securities of a, what I believe was a client of Lehman Brothers, and a partner, a fairly significant partner of Lehman Brothers, Mr. Thomas, was on the board of the issuer company.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.998" offset="3803602">And the Court refused, this Court refused to hold that Lehman Brothers as an entity was a director through Mr. Thomas.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.875" offset="3835053">That conclusion I don't think was self-evident to the bar before this Court's reading of the statute, and I think the Court took into account that this statute is a inflexible statute that imposes requirements that are not necessarily going to produce just results to particular defendants or to particular plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.988" offset="3919586">Similar approaches have been taken by the Court in every case that this Court has had, I believe, involving section 16(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="957.836" offset="3958978">In the Foremost-McKesson case that was before this Court we had a situation, or the Court had a situation, of a shareholder who acquired more than 10 percent of the shares, and the question... and therefore would ordinarily be a statutory insider, and the question is when do you become an insider.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.569" offset="4025852">And you can arrange your purchases so that if, for example, you wanted to get 16 percent of the stock, you could do that consistently with the statute, to be within the statute or be without the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.906" offset="4071200">For example, you could acquire up to 9.9 percent and then look for a block of another 8 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.841" offset="4094920">And if you acquired your 16 or 17 percent that way, when you sold that block you would have no statutory liability, as a result of a decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.077" offset="4135880">The SEC, I don't think... I think opposed that result in this Court, but the Court said look, we're dealing with a statute that is a very inflexible one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.762" offset="4170675">It imposes rather strict requirements and harsh requirements, sometimes unjust, and we're going to read the words not in an expansive, not in a broad manner as the SEC there and as the SEC here has contended, but in a rather narrow fashion, because we recognize that it sometimes can produce undesirable results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.377" offset="4249147">We're going to apply the words Congress wrote in the manner in which Congress intended that they be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.300" offset="4268791">This Court thereafter had a case, the Reliance Electric case, in which somebody who did own more than 10 percent of the shares decided he would sell those shares in two pieces rather than one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.250" offset="4312572">The first piece got him from some 14 percent to 9.8 percent, and he paid his profit back to the corporation on those shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.266" offset="4348621">Then he sold all of the shares and paid no part of the profit back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.009" offset="4367638">The issue came to this Court as wasn't that a device, wasn't that some avoidance scheme, isn't that wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.603" offset="4389999">And the Court said, you know, under this statute we're going to enforce it the way it was written and let the SEC, who argued to the contrary in that case, do what they should do if it's a problem with this statute, if there's a hole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.672" offset="4442244">We, the Court, are not going to tinker with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.815" offset="4450812">Go to the proper forum to do so, which is the Congress of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.609" offset="4470038">And so the Court in cases thereafter has also applied a narrow, not a broad construction of the statute so that--</text>

            <text syncTime="1116.813" offset="4594903">One of the common characteristics I suppose we have as lawyers is that we read words and recognize that they don't always say the exact... have the exact meaning that one draws from a very strict reading of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.323" offset="4648924">So the word "institute" has got to be construed in the context in which Congress passed this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.228" offset="4668464">It was riding against the back drop of derivative actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.191" offset="4684347">Now, derivative action principles that go back over a century in this Court, which has laid down the basic principles, and they say that a shareholder... you have to be a shareholder of a corporation to bring an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.309" offset="4732830">Now that has been construed by State courts and by Federal courts as meaning that you need to own your shares throughout the litigation, not that you should only have your shares at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.047" offset="4771804">What is the point of the Congress ever adopting such a requirement if it was to be a formality that would be forgotten the moment the plaintiff leaves the clerk's office?</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.994" offset="4811615">Of course the court had... the Congress had in mind a continuing interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.157" offset="4828229">And the SEC has recognized that in its own rulemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.640" offset="4842126">But I think once you get into the problem of under what circumstances do you permit somebody who was formerly a shareholder to continue to assume that position, that is, if he's a shareholder of a parent corporation, he lost his shares involuntarily in a merger, and so on, then I suggest that what the Court is being asked to do is to make policy decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.984" offset="4939511">And I am not suggesting that those policy decisions are not real ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.898" offset="4955184">The Commission has been struggling with those policy decisions, and I think the problem with their struggle is that they keep coming up with different rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.263" offset="4984650">I don't know if the Commission has the authority to correct it, but if they do it's because they are exercising not a judicial function but a quasi-legislative function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.379" offset="5021117">This is a statute, I think, that has to be given a strict and a literal interpretation, but in accordance with the common sense with which it is... that lies behind the words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.589" offset="5065943">And I don't think that the Congress intended to say well, "instituted" is to be applied and thereafter who cares whether the plaintiff continues to have any standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.216" offset="5112441">For example, suppose that you have a shareholder that is divested of his shares in an all-cash merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.901" offset="5143161">The Commission originally and in its rules said well, we're going to continue standing for such a plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.495" offset="5165627">They now say well, we'll do that only if he sued before the merger, consistently with the literalist reading of the word "instituted".</text>

            <text syncTime="1273.645" offset="5222155">A shareholder who was cashed out in a merger, Your Honor, has no real constitutional jurisdiction, for that matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1371.232" offset="5612529">Now I'm not saying that you apply a different interpretive rule because the law has developed in other areas, but I do say then, and this Court has said in its adjudications in section 16(b) that there are other remedies that plaintiffs have if there is real insider trading going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.534" offset="5685777">There is 10(b)(5) that has, as the Court knows, is a post-1934 developments, although section 10(b) was in the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.411" offset="5725274">There is section 14(e) of the act and the regulations under that dealing with insider trading and tender offer situations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1425.871" offset="5831122">That's not this case and I don't think we need argue it, but the Court has recognized and taken some comfort from the fact that there are other remedies available in true insider trading cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.767" offset="5874694">Insofar as the issue of whether or not... I think, Justice O'Connor, you had raised this question, whether or not a shareholder of a parent or a grandparent corporation has or should continue to have standing, whether he has a sufficient interest to permit that person to sue, the statute uses the term "issuer".</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.870" offset="5955047">It doesn't use the term "grandparent" or "parent".</text>

            <text syncTime="1957.308" offset="7956862">So, as I said, it's palpable that the intent of Congress was to cast standing in as broad a compass as possible, and I gave the example that Congress didn't confine standing to stock owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.163" offset="8036275">Also there is no requirement under 16(b) that the security owner owned a security contemporaneously at the time of the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.711" offset="8086430">And that is another rule in ordinary derivative actions which is not the case in 16(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.126" offset="8120075">Thirdly, Congress made it clear in 16(b) that the shareholder is not bound by the business judgment of the issuer not to sue, which of course is not the situation in ordinary derivative actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.099" offset="8187994">So, my submission to the Court is it's as if Congress had explicitly written in 16(b) that we want shareholder standing to be as broad as possible, and further that if Congress had been presented by this case when it enacted the statute it would surely have opted for standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.443" offset="8281408">Now, to return to the formal argument, the facts in this case are quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.693" offset="8330413">First, the plaintiff owned the stock of the issuer at the time he commenced this 16(b) action, so that he satisfied the requirement of 16(b) that he be the owner of any security issuer at the time of institution of suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.396" offset="8413169">Secondly, in the merger by which the issuer became the wholly owned subsidiary of another company, that is the parent company, the plaintiff received stock as a result of the merger in the parent company, so that the plaintiff has a continuing financial interest to maintain a 16(b) action in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.947" offset="8535422">And further, since plaintiff's 16(b) action had been commenced prior to the merger and was pending at the time of the merger, this case presents the possible danger of a restructuring intentionally designed to defeat section 16(b).</text>

            <text syncTime="2211.361" offset="8973026">Moreover, in two of those four courts of appeals decisions, the plaintiff had never been a shareholder of the issuer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2357.918" offset="9559318">Now, on the point of the double derivative action, this 16(b) case is maintained not only as a single derivative action, but as a double derivative action whereby the plaintiff enforces derivatively the parent's derivative right to sue on behalf of the issuer under 16(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.725" offset="9650538">The commentators, and that's Professor Laws and Professor Blumberg, state that there is no reason why under 16(b) double derivative actions should be singled out for nonmaintainability.</text>

            <text syncTime="2999.042" offset="12123811">But, Justice Scalia, Congress has in fact made clear that it in fact intends to deal with the potential, the possibility for abuse in the misuse of inside information, and that to do that it has sought to confer standing on security holders to bring the lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.146" offset="12208134">It does not follow, in our view, that Congress necessarily was blind to the implications of eventual article III questions of mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.293" offset="12252751">But this Court resolves those questions frequently and the cases, even in Justice O'Connor's hypothetical, the cases that could arise under this statute don't necessarily pose questions of mootness that are any more difficult than the questions this Court faces in other Federal contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.905" offset="12311266">The mootness issue does arise from time to time, but in this case, in this case this plaintiff has no difficulty meeting that test of continuing economic interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.871" offset="12359122">The corporation whose securities he now holds was formed for the purpose of this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.365" offset="12385035">It engaged in no business activities until it engaged in the financing of this transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3076.243" offset="12432578">So in many ways Mendell's interest in the parent is an indirect but very strong economic equivalent of the security of the issuer he originally held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.321" offset="12480853">We would urge on the Court the plain language of 6... of section 16, but also the purposes for which the statute was originally adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.989" offset="12523589">And the argument which we feel that the defendants here are advancing to the Court, which is that on the basis of derivative analogies which we feel do not fairly apply that the Court carve out a statutory exception to the ability of a 16(b) plaintiff to continue to litigate his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.011" offset="12599658">We respectfully submit that there is nothing in the statute that warrants carving out that exception in this case and on these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.088" offset="12631945">The time and the place in which the Court should consider what the extent of an economic interest is that would satisfy or fail to satisfy article III considerations or mootness considerations should be reserved for another time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.430" offset="12689310">The plaintiff... the defendants, rather, in this case place great store by derivative analogies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.615" offset="12722015">Their only source for that purported analogy... for that purported statutory gloss based on the analogy, is to the rules that govern derivative suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.590" offset="12757960">And we respectfully submit that those really are not appropriate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.534" offset="12773738">If one examines the structure again of the statute, it is quite clear the derivative analogy simply does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.347" offset="12797039">The opening words of section 16(b) state that it was adopted for the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.383" offset="12833088">Now that stands, we would submit, in stark contrast to the compensatory or the indemnificatory natures of derivative actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.740" offset="12862554">Section 16(b) is manifestly broader.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.751" offset="12874570">Creditor holders of securities and not merely shareholders can institute these suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.054" offset="12891811">Directors cannot refuse a demand... cannot by refusing demand terminate the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.965" offset="12911455">Where Congress intended that one hold the security for purposes of being a defendant, it was quite clear in the statute that Congress intended one be a 10 percent holder of the security both at the time of the purchase and the time of the sale, which are being matched for the purposes of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.938" offset="12979373">So Congress knew how to address questions of timing of security holdings when it considered that important for granting the requisites of the statute, when invoking the enforcement apparatus of the statute.</text>
