            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73956">The second of the two cases is Yates versus Evatt 89-7691.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.735" offset="100810">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of South Carolina to determine whether burden-shifting jury instructions in a criminal case were harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.372" offset="147412">The petitioner and another man robbed a store in Greenville County, South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.766" offset="164967">The petitioner's colleague killed a woman during the course of the robbery, and the petitioner was charged as an accomplice murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.141" offset="194433">At his trial, petitioner's jury was instructed that in determining whether the killer acted with malice in stabbing the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.313" offset="223167">Malice is implied or presumed from either the willful, deliberate, or intentional doing of an unlawful act or from the use of a deadly weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.657" offset="264545">The Supreme Court of South Carolina identified these instructions is unconstitutional burden-shifting presumptions under this court's decisions in Sandstrom and Montana, and Francis and Franklin.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.454" offset="311670">The State Supreme Court correctly held that the presumptions were nonetheless subject to harmless error review under the standard articulated in Chapman and California, in which we held that a constitutional error is harmless if it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.969" offset="385754">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we hold that in applying the standard to a jury instruction raising an unconstitutional presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.913" offset="421594">The court must first look to the entire jury instructions as a guide to determine what evidence the jury actually considered on the subject matter addressed by the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.358" offset="459314">The reviewing court must then weigh the probative evidence, probative force of that evidence, as against the force of the presumption standing alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.233" offset="494841">In order to meet the test of harmless error, it is not enough that the jury considered evidence from which it could have reached the verdict without reliance on the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.420" offset="531621">The issue is whether the jury actually rested its verdict on evidence establishing the presumed fact beyond reasonable doubt independently of the presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.826" offset="569238">State Supreme Court in this case employed a deficient standard of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.544" offset="588046">Its stated inquiry was to determine whether it is beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found it unnecessary to rely on the erroneous mandatory presumption regarding malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.280" offset="630991">This inquiry can determine that the verdict could have been the same without the presumptions when there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict independently of the presumptions' effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.842" offset="669234">But it does not satisfy Champan's concerns because it fails to determine whether the jury's verdict did rest on that evidence as well as on the presumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.608" offset="704343">It fails to determine whether that evidence was of such a compelling force as to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the presumptions must have made no difference in reaching the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.240" offset="742900">The decision below must, therefore, be reversed on this ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.771" offset="760976">Because this case has already been to this court and had been remanded twice, once for harmless error analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.683" offset="788666">We have decided to make our own assessment of the harmlessness of the jury instructions on malice and we hold that they were not harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.959" offset="817714">The judgment of the Supreme Court of South Carolina is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.334" offset="847285">Justice Scalia has filed a separate opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment in which Justice Blackmun has joined in part.</text>
