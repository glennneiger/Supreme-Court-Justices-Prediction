            <text syncTime="17.394" offset="199088">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="20.546" offset="211731">This case brings before the Court an important issue of the coverage of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.851" offset="240988">The specific question is whether the results test of section 2 of that act applies to the election of judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.196" offset="274320">In its en banc opinion in the LULAC case, which will be argued next, the Fifth Circuit held that judges are not covered by the results test.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.364" offset="323013">The court's reasoning was that section 2(b) of that statute, added in 1982, by its terms applies to the election of representatives, and in the court's view, the elected judges are not representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.815" offset="392812">As a result of the opinion in LULAC, the Fifth Circuit panel in this case, which involves a challenge to the at-large election of two justices of the Louisiana Supreme Court, ordered this lawsuit dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.258" offset="458536">In our view the Fifth Circuit, with all respect, is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.559" offset="475777">It is wrong in light of the text of the Voting Rights Act, including its comprehensive definition of vote and voting set forth in section 14(c)(1), in light of the structure of the statute, including section 5, the preclearance provision, which all admit covers the election of judges, and in light of the elaborate history of the Voting Rights Act at the time of its original passage and the 1982 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.202" offset="610360">The Fifth Circuit also, we believe, erred on what it viewed as a basic point.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.516" offset="631571">That is not only are judges covered by the terms of the statute, when they are elected they are candidates for public office, and that is what the Voting Rights Act covers.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.042" offset="673680">But it is also wrong as to the meaning of the term "representatives".</text>
            <text syncTime="141.575" offset="695832">We think that for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.949" offset="705341">The first is that Congress provided no definition of the term "representatives".</text>
            <text syncTime="150.182" offset="730314">There is no indication that Congress was using this as a term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.135" offset="750062">And judges who are elected are quite literally representatives within the dictionary meaning of that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.170" offset="782245">And, as Judge Higginbotham pointed out in his concurring opinion in LULAC, judges who have been chosen by the people and are directly accountable to the people are in a very real and practical sense representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.631" offset="852044">And we see that in the Louisiana system.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.473" offset="863434">That is the candidates for a seat on the Louisiana Supreme Court are involved fully in the political process in the very basic sense of getting themselves elected to public office.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.941" offset="913275">And that's what the Voting Rights Act is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.153" offset="926128">It's about voting, and it's about elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.125" offset="938040">And whatever, the very important, the lofty function, the solemn responsibility of that justice, once the justice is in office, the plain fact remains that to get into office in Louisiana the justice had to get himself elected.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.160" offset="1134167">And I think the Court can see that both in terms of the function of that body of law and what that body of law was designed to get at, and it can see it most clearly in this Court's decision in White against Regester.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.230" offset="1186516">Because there, in analyzing the Texas districting scheme, the Court rejected a one-person one-vote challenge, but at the same time credited and upheld an attack to the minority dilution effect in the two counties... in Dallas County and Bayer County.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.701" offset="1256315">The two are entirely distinct lines of authority seeking to get at different themes.</text>

            <text syncTime="286.996" offset="1277527">But if the judges are representatives in the way that you have described, then ought we to rethink that line of authority and indicate that one-person one-vote does apply to all representatives?</text>
            <text syncTime="301.636" offset="1336146">It seems to me that, to the extent you say judges are representatives, that it may undercut the rationale of the line of authority which suggests that one-person one-vote is inapplicable.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.476" offset="1403437">And I disagree for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.660" offset="1412214">Think of a large State with perhaps quite small predominantly rural counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.623" offset="1440009">The law is, and I think the law is sound in this respect, that a State as a matter of policy can make a determination that each county should have a judge, even if the numbers don't justify that.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.373" offset="1495075">So too, it may very well be that even though the numbers may not justify in terms of population the large number of judges in an urban district as opposed to a suburban district that perhaps is less litigious, nonetheless States can determine to order their on structures in ways that are responsive to the needs of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.579" offset="1591832">That strikes us as very sensible, and this Court itself in White against Regester said those same kinds of State interests and State policies permit greater deviations in State legislative redistricting than is the case in congressional districting, which requires almost mathematical exactitude.</text>

            <text syncTime="1238.074" offset="5081896">--Well, Justice Souter, in this case because it's a State supreme court, I would suggest that if the State of Louisiana had one district with 3 million people in it and another district with 12 people in it, that would violate the Equal Protection Clause because it would be arbitrary, regardless of whether one-person one-vote applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.637" offset="5148142">That's what this Court held in Salyer against Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.152" offset="5166115">It held that even when one-person one-vote principles don't apply, the State still has to comport with the Equal Protection Clause principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.646" offset="5192133">And I think that those principles allow you to use as an illustrative example... because that is all that the first prong of Gingles asked, is is there an alternative to the present system which would afford minorities an equal opportunity to participate and to elect the candidates of their choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.458" offset="5251378">If you can show that, that establishes that first prong of Gingles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.652" offset="5268201">It doesn't require the State to adopt that as the remedy at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.844" offset="5280949">Indeed, one thing that may be of interest to the Court is that the districts upon which this Court rested in Gingles in finding dilution were not the districts that were ultimately adopted at the remedial phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.982" offset="5321491">Because the State had the right to come back with another set of districts, and as long as those districts fully remedied the violation, the State is free to do what it wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.719" offset="5352420">The second... the third point I wanted to make about that is that in light of the decision by this Court in Wells against Edwards, that's a summary affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.736" offset="5392544">I think that the dissent had the better of the argument there, but you needn't go that far in order to find that there was a mechanism for establishing dilution in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.812" offset="5428802">The second point I wanted to address is the role of section 2(b), because I think that goes to Justice O'Connor's question about whether referenda are covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.038" offset="5457746">Section 14(c)(1), the definitional provision of the act, says that the word "vote" includes any election at which propositions are voted on, as well as candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.176" offset="5498288">Now section 2 of the act is the only nationwide prohibition on discrimination, and my answer would be that section 2 in part (a) defines what is prohibited, and part (b) is just one illustration of how to go about proving that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.183" offset="5546249">And I'd like to give a concrete example of how you might challenge a referenda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.507" offset="5563594">Suppose, for example, in a county that is majority black but in which blacks are segregated in certain parts of the county, you have to get a certain number of signatures to get an initiative on a ballot from each precinct in the county, and there is racial polarization and black people can't get any signatures in a white area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.981" offset="5633498">You might be able to challenge that referenda provision for signatures and petitions under the Results Clause because it dilutes the strength there of a black majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.877" offset="5669024">So it's not just election of representatives that is covered by the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.241" offset="5686474">Even if this Court were to hold that the word representatives doesn't include judges, it would still have to grapple with 2(a), which says no voting rights standard practice or procedure, and that includes ones in which no candidate is chosen at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.629" offset="5736106">Finally with regard to the question of merit selection, yes, the Voting Rights Act would apply to merit selections as well because, for example, if the State set up its districts so that no matter what blacks did, whether they voted to retain a judge or to throw him out, they were always outvoted in that retention election by a white block vote, then the structure of the districts could be challenged itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1922.807" offset="7820782">I will, however, considering my time, like to move on to the rest of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.101" offset="7845964">Obviously we have a plain meaning question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.645" offset="7864146">Now, representatives was used, as we all know, as being a suggestion of a word rather than legislators.</text>

            <text syncTime="1944.422" offset="7907195">Senator Dole, who drew the so-called compromise amendment, said if we want to use the results test from White, let's use the language from White.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.309" offset="7946797">And that's what occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.011" offset="7953589">They didn't use the word "candidate", which would have embraced the judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.115" offset="7978040">They didn't talk about public officials, which would have embraced the judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.970" offset="7997475">Instead they used one word, representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.932" offset="8009282">Obviously candidate would have been more than representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.636" offset="8020044">Candidate appears four times within the statute itself, and for reasons only they know they chose not to use that word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.381" offset="8063094">Now I'd like to move, if I may, to the question of... well, obviously I want to make the point that if anybody knows what a representative is, surely Congress would know what a representative was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.403" offset="8127146">Now, for 18 years preceding this act or the amendment to this act there were 15 cases, admittedly in the one-man one-vote area of the law, holding that judges were not representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.135" offset="8198095">Not one of those cases has indicated, that I could see, in any of the reports, any of the suggestions, any of the arguments, why would Congress, a body who somebody quoted as being of lawyers, why would Congress ignore the entire one-third structure of all 50 States, except for the reason that it did not want to include judges as being representatives?</text>

            <text syncTime="2126.972" offset="8637475">Now, if one wants to read it out of 2(a), it's still in the Fifteenth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2132.178" offset="8658268">And incidentally, despite the fact that this Court had indicated that intent was out of the window, I would suggest to you that the authoritative, everybody agrees what the Senate report said is authoritative, in one, two, three, four, five, six places in the Senate report it said you could use the intent standard or you could use the results standard under section 2.</text>
