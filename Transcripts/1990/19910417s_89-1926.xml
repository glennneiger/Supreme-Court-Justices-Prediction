            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="74377">The second case, United States versus Centennial Savings Bank No. 89-1926, is here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.364" offset="135817">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we hold that a lending institution realizes deductible losses when it exchanges mortgage loan with another lender.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.740" offset="205303">We also hold that family withdrawal from these accounts collected by a savings account do not qualify as income from the discharge of in debt following under Section 108 of the tax code.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.308" offset="279595">We therefore affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.114" offset="306762">Justice Blackmun has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Justice White joins.</text>
