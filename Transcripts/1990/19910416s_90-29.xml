            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="6.548" offset="100251">These consolidated cases come to us on writs of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.974" offset="125956">Arkansas imposes a sales tax on all tangible personal property and on a wide range of services.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.951" offset="153855">In 1987, Arkansas included for the first time a sales tax on cable television services.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.559" offset="180291">A cable television subscriber, an operator, and a trade association representing cable operators in Arkansas, challenge the application of the sales tax to cable services and the exemption or exclusion from the tax of newspaper sales, subscription magazine sales, and sales of scrambled satellite broadcast television service to home dish antenna owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.049" offset="282273">In the Arkansas Chancery Court, they argued that the tax violated their constitutional rights under the First Amendment and under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.071" offset="326367">Shortly after the Chancery Court upheld the constitutionality of the sales tax, Arkansas' legislature extended the tax to scramble satellite television services.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.954" offset="373910">On appeal, the State Supreme Court held that the sales taxation of cable television services did not violate the First Amendment after its extension to scramble satellite television.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.813" offset="425319">Believing, however, that the First Amendment prohibits discriminatory taxation among members of the same medium and that cable and scramble satellite television services were substantially the same, the Supreme Court of Arkansas held that the tax violated the First Amendment for that period during which, it applied to cable but not to scramble satellite services.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.566" offset="520300">Both the cable petitioners and the Arkansas Commissioner of Revenue petitioned this Court for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.112" offset="546527">We granted the petitions to decide whether the First Amendment prohibits or prevents a state from exempting or excluding from its sales tax only certain segments of the media.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.686" offset="596787">We conclude that Arkansas' extension of its generally applicable sales tax to cable television services alone or to cable and satellite services, while exempting the print media did not violate the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.539" offset="660212">Arkansas' sales tax presents none of the First Amendment difficulties that have led us to strike down differential taxation among members of the press in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.585" offset="700441">Unlike our previous cases, this case involves a generally applicable sales tax that does not single out the press for special treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.191" offset="738893">There is no indication that Arkansas has targeted cable television in a purposeful attempt to interfere with its First Amendment activities, nor is the tax structured so is to raise suspicion that it was intended to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.074" offset="794377">Moreover, the tax is not content based.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.861" offset="809528">We hold that differential taxation of speakers does not violate the First Amendment unless the tax is directed at or presents the danger of suppressing particular ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.817" offset="857385">Arkansas' exemption or exclusion of certain media from its sales tax has not suggested any interest in censoring the expressive activities of cable television, nor is there an indication that the tax is likely to stifle the free exchange of ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.791" offset="929273">We leave the question of whether the state's temporary tax distinction between cable and satellite services violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause to the Arkansas Supreme Court for consideration on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.315" offset="991340">Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Blackmun has joined.</text>
