            <text syncTime="106.073" offset="561119">But I'd like to start of course with the statutory claim, because should you reverse this case, agreeing with our statutory claim, you would avoid the need to reach the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.562" offset="607094">Now, the statutory framework that governs the special trial judges is straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.095" offset="633217">It's set forth in Internal Revenue Code 7443A, which is reprinted at A100 in the cert. petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.641" offset="663414">And it divides the work of the tax court potentially between the regularly appointed tax court judges, who now number 19, and special trial judges whom Congress has authorized the chief judge of the trial court to appoint and to remove at his pleasure.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.253" offset="733840">Now special trial judges are governed by 7443A, B, and C.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.216" offset="757664">And to make it simple, they have two kinds of function.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.819" offset="772083">The special trial judges may hear and decide certain specified kinds of tax cases, specially specified declaratory judgment claims and small tax claims involving amounts under $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.160" offset="833523">They may hear and decide those cases set forth in 7443A(b)(1) to (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="181.944" offset="864661">(b)(4), the sole provision at issue in this case is the catch-all provision that says they may also hear but not decide any other proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.713" offset="915652">Now let me try to clarify the points of agreement and disagreement between petitioners and the Government with respect to the statutory claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.609" offset="951283">Petitioners and the Government agree completely that Congress did not authorize special trial judges to decide (b)(4) cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.775" offset="995901">(b)(4), coupled with (c), precludes decision by a special trial judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="278.016" offset="1248870">And I'd like to point out it... precisely how we read the rules to do just that.</text>

            <text syncTime="531.253" offset="2261899">When petitioners came to the tax court back in 1982, they sought adjudication of their alleged deficiencies before a regular tax court judge, and they were so assigned to regular tax court Judge Wilbur, presidential appointee.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.515" offset="2318950">Judge Wilbur began to try the case... try the case from June 1984 through November 1985, when he suddenly became ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.748" offset="2347790">So there was no pre-trial consent to the special trial judge presiding in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.831" offset="2368165">First key moment in the case is in November 1985, after this illness sets in, when... in mid trial... the petitioners consented to have a special trial judge, special trial Judge Powell, sit as an evidentiary referee while the proceedings were videotaped so that Judge Wilbur could still make the decision in the first instance based on the videotape.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.376" offset="2454369">Time goes by... December 1985 to June 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.040" offset="2472968">Special trial Judge Powell does conduct the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.203" offset="2481641">And then after the trial is complete, after all the evidence is taken, in July 1986 for the first time is it proposed by Chief Judge Sterrett of the tax court that Justice... Judge Powell, special trial Judge Powell, actually file the report under the provisions of (b)(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="606.637" offset="2563352">So there was a mid-trial consent to his continuing the case as an evidentiary referee.</text>

            <text syncTime="635.978" offset="2680799">In Peretz there was an issue of waiver of the statutory claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="644.947" offset="2716639">The Fifth Circuit held that the statutory claim was not waived by the petitioners' mid-trial consent to evidentiary refereeing or post-trial consent to the filing of the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.805" offset="2756031">The Government didn't cross-petition and has raised no claim of statutory waiver here.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.299" offset="2774003">So, in contrast to Peretz, I believe the statutory question really must be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.141" offset="2793439">As to the question of whether the constitutional claim can be waived, we argue quite simply that it's a structural claim of precisely the kind that you, speaking for the Court, Justice O'Connor, in CFTC v. Schor said waiver should not affect.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.321" offset="2854147">But just to return to the third key moment in the trial if I could, it's October 21st, 1987, when we argue that the key decision effectively by the special trial judge is realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.970" offset="2904720">To answer your question, Mr. Chief Justice, October 21st, 1987, is the day on which the Chief Judge of the tax court, Judge Sterrett, does two things on the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.317" offset="2946098">Number one, he issues an order reassigning the case to himself from special trial Judge Powell, who sometime in the proceeding 4 months had filed a report with the Chief Judge of the tax court.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.816" offset="2996149">Second, on the same day, he adopts and a... he states in an opinion that he agrees with and adopts the findings of the special trial judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="982.548" offset="4067065">Up until 1984, the tax court had provided by its rules for exceptions by the parties to the special trial judge's report and an opportunity to try to get the tax court judge to reject some of those findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.439" offset="4122549">That opportunity was eliminated in 1984.</text>

            <text syncTime="1060.953" offset="4380639">Mr. Chief Justice, we think clearly so and in haec verba, our first question was not contrary to the Government's suggestion, does the statute permit assignment of special trial judges only to preside at (b)(4) cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.482" offset="4434764">Our question presented and the one accepted... granted the review in the Court was, as you can see from the first page of our cert. petition, are complex tax cases allowed to be assigned to a special trial judge for trial and effective resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.123" offset="4501324">In fact, effective resolution is the heart of our statutory claim and it was the ground on which the Fifth Circuit decided below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.439" offset="4530581">The Fifth Circuit decided there was no rubber stamp, and hence, we were out of luck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.162" offset="4545523">We claim that, regardless of whether you call it a rubber stamp or not, the tax court's rules ensure that, as happened in this case, the usual opportunities for supervision and control that one would expect in an adjunct adjudicatory scheme like this are missing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.224" offset="4617726">In other words, just to put our point succinctly, Congress did not and could not have intended special trial judges in large, complex, multiparty, multimillion dollar tax shelter cases... alleged tax shelter cases such as this one... Congress did not and could not have intended such cases to be in effect decided by the autonomous actions of a special trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.453" offset="4726604">Now, if there are no further questions on the statutory claim, I'll move on to our constitutional argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.106" offset="4757220">As I mentioned at the outset, should you agree with us that the statute was violated by the tax court's rules and conduct in this case, you would then nonetheless need to reach... sorry... should... if you agree with us on the statute, you need not reach our constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.269" offset="4837886">But should you disagree with us on the statute, let me state as simply as I can what the key points of difference and agreement are between us and the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.125" offset="4873308">Now, of course, we deal here with one of the plainest texts in the Constitution... the appointments clause that permits Congress to delegate the power to appoint inferior officers to the President alone, not at issue here, to the heads of departments, or the courts of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.528" offset="4942898">Now, if I could dispose quickly of the employee point and the court of law point, I will get to the key point of difference between us and the Government, which is whether or not the tax court may possibly be considered an executive department for appointments clause purposes and thus its Chief Judge the head of that department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.551" offset="5023042">I think the employee point and the court of law argument can be dismissed quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.054" offset="5045089">It is beyond serious dispute that special trial judges are inferior officers of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.438" offset="5078630">They are far more than mere ministerial aides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.114" offset="5097334">They... and every court to have decided this question has agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.226" offset="5117710">In terms of this Court's own definition there can be no doubt that they satisfy every formal definition of what an officer is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1278.280" offset="5249994">But we would rely more heavily on your statement more recently in Buckley that the function... the functional test for an officer is whether he exercises significant authority pursuant to the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1335.896" offset="5480394">It's... it's more clear, but we absolutely disagree that the officer is demoted to employee when he is merely presiding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.023" offset="5516965">We think that's in appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.205" offset="5521667">He... a magistrate does not cease to be an officer and become a merely employee when he is carrying out pretrial hearings as opposed to disposing of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.790" offset="5556044">And just as a lawyer is still a lawyer, protected by the attorney-client privilege, if she's at the xerox machine, just as the President is still President when he's walking the dog on the White House lawn, so a special trial judge cannot become an employee just because he is performing a task that could have been performed by an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.273" offset="5629919">So we would respectfully say... respectfully suggest that even if there were effective supervision consistent with the statute, the special trial judge would still be an officer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1784.199" offset="7273648">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.441" offset="7294650">Petitioners claim that the appointment of a special trial judge to hear and report on their cases which is authorized by the plain language of section 7443A(b)(4) is unconstitutional under the appointments clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.212" offset="7349716">There are two reasons that this Court should not reach that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.732" offset="7363718">First, petitioners waived it by consenting to have their cases heard by a special trial judge in the tax court and waiting to raise their claim until it reached the court of appeals, which quite properly declined to consider it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.173" offset="7417530">Second, the special trial judge assigned to hear and report on petitioners' cases under subsection (b)(4) performed duties that may be performed by an employee and do not require an officer of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.303" offset="7470088">The appointments clause is therefore not implicated on the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.317" offset="7486075">First, the waiver point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.227" offset="7493703">When the regular tax court judge became too ill to continue hearing petitioners' cases, the chief judge did not simply reassign the cases to a special trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.633" offset="7531319">He issued an order proposing such a reassignment and inviting any objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.908" offset="7552426">Hearings were held to consider objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.449" offset="7562666">Petitioners, represented by counsel, discussed with the chief judge the issue of reassignment and settled upon terms under which they would consent to the reassignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.415" offset="7602477">One taxpayer did object, and his case was severed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.778" offset="7615956">Petitioners never did object.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.039" offset="7624942">And even after the tax court decision, in two motions to reconsider, never once raised the appointments clause problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.365" offset="7654304">Now, the reasons for a waiver rule I think we've seen this morning--</text>

            <text syncTime="3155.284" offset="12758003">That is our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.045" offset="12761034">And we know that it is not in the legislative branch, and it is not an article III court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.639" offset="12779424">They say that it... there are reasons to doubt were their words in their reply brief... that it's in the executive branch because it performs adjudicatory functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.926" offset="12816518">But it adjudicates public rights cases that Congress may leave within the executive under Murry's Lessee, which was itself a tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.062" offset="12849119">Now, it's easy, of course, to visualize what the tax court does as being adjudicatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.363" offset="12870330">It looks, acts like a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.905" offset="12876495">But it's also quite simple, as is the case in all... in every public rights' case to visualize what the tax court does as being purely executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.301" offset="12910036">There are officials in the Internal Revenue Service who sit down and decide what a taxpayer owes the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="3244.535" offset="13114941">The question becomes, what happened in 1969 that made it any different?</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.249" offset="13129883">Congress took language that said this is an agency in the executive branch and substituted language saying this is a court of record under article I.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.634" offset="13163424">We agree with the Second Circuits recent decision that what they did was change the label.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.865" offset="13180247">They didn't purport in the statute to move the tax court outside the executive branch and didn't purport to put it in any other branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.980" offset="13208772">The legislative history did say... not the statute, the legislative history... we think that the tax court should be considered an article I court rather than an executive agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.389" offset="13258405">To our way of looking at it, that's like saying something should be considered an orange rather than a fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.373" offset="13282333">It's both.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.572" offset="13287140">There... the article I court... quite happy to call it that... but it remains in the executive branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.098" offset="13313262">And we think that's confirmed by the fact that in 1969, Congress continued the incumbent tax court judges in office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.393" offset="13346386">If Congress were doing something as dramatic as moving the tax court out of the executive branch and placing it somewhere else, it plainly would have no authority to continue those judges in office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.059" offset="13385047">That would be an appointment from one entity to another.</text>
