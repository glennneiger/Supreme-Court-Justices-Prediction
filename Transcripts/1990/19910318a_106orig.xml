            <text syncTime="12.038" offset="172044">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.841" offset="179254">In 1986 Illinois filed a complaint against the Commonwealth of Kentucky in this original action.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.435" offset="205690">In the complaint Illinois alleged that Kentucky had directly infringed upon its sovereignty by exercising its boating and fishing laws north of the 1792 low-water mark on the northwestern side of the Ohio River.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.474" offset="261801">Prior to this litigation the 1792 low-water mark with respect to Illinois had never been plotted, designated, or otherwise marked.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.141" offset="300462">And prior to that action there had never been any boundary dispute between Illinois and Kentucky or any recurring litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.196" offset="332750">In the answer Kentucky denied that it had directly infringed upon Illinois' sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.820" offset="359186">Instead, Kentucky asserted that its boundary on the Ohio River is the low-water mark on the northwestern side of the river as it exists from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.705" offset="394712">In other words, the current low-water mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.837" offset="407251">Also in the answer Kentucky raised two affirmative defenses, one affirmative defense being that of acquiescence, the second affirmative defense being that of latches.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.666" offset="450614">Kentucky raised the defense of acquiescence because it wanted to invoke and employ the basic teachings of Georgia v. South Carolina, and that is Kentucky wanted to maintain, and to this day wants to maintain, the status quo on the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.006" offset="515920">Kentucky submits that the boundary between the two States, as it has been for 168 years, is the low-water mark on the northwestern side of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.961" offset="551760">By bringing the complaint, Illinois in essence seeks to change this boundary and make it the 1792 low-water mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.468" offset="581749">Kentucky submits that there are many practical considerations with respect to utilizing the low-water mark on the north side of the river as the boundary between the two States.</text>

            <label>Mr. Rickie Leon Pearson</label>
            <text syncTime="176.236" offset="828867">There was a dissent in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.455" offset="833778">And might I add, it appeared to favor Kentucky with respect to its argument here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.620" offset="858438">But there are some historical antecedents and factors that go into why Kentucky has recognized the ever-changing low-water mark on the Ohio River for 168 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.817" offset="899189">It all starts back in 1818 when you look at the Illinois Enabling Act, the 1818 constitution of Illinois, the 1848 constitution of Illinois, and the 1870 constitution of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.756" offset="950911">All these documents, when viewed, conclude that the boundary between Illinois and Kentucky is the low-water mark, as those documents put it, along the northwestern shore, meaning the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.547" offset="1006082">Perhaps maybe the most important notification that Kentucky had with respect to the low-water mark on the northwestern side of the river came from an 1849 report of the Illinois Joint Select Committee to investigate Illinois' boundary on the Ohio River.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.418" offset="1073582">That legislative body concluded that the boundary between Illinois and Kentucky is the low-water mark on the northwestern side of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.864" offset="1111408">Kentucky submits that the conclusion of the Joint Select Committee from Illinois is in keeping with the 1820 case of Handly's Lessee v. Anthony.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.240" offset="1148919">In the Anthony case the court was called upon for the first time to construe the 1784 Virginia Deed of Cession which gave lands to the United States of America, and thereby created Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.461" offset="1213808">In construing the 1784 cession, the court in Anthony's Lessee concluded that the boundary for Kentucky on the Ohio River is the low-water mark on the northern side of the river, or to put it in another term used by the court, the water's edge.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.341" offset="1273262">But there were many factors why the court reached this conclusion, one of them being that it would be convenient for future population, because at that time the United States was growing.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.379" offset="1317461">Secondly, it was an identifiable boundary mark between the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.354" offset="1337315">With that in mind, Kentucky submits that by using the low-water mark on the northwestern side of the river as it exists from time to time, or currently, or as it prevails, is the most practical approach to resolving the boundary dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.363" offset="1393426">After all--</text>

            <text syncTime="449.182" offset="1920681">That's precisely our point.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.854" offset="1927368">For instance, if we look at the bridges that cross the Ohio River between Illinois and Kentucky, there are four of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.509" offset="1954013">Basically a bridge that was constructed in 1929, the Brookport bridge, 1938 the Cairo bridge, which, that's what they call it in Illinois, they don't call it Cairo, the 1956 Shinytown bridge, and the 1974 Interstate 24 bridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.278" offset="2013050">With respect to the Interstate 24 bridge, in 1971 a construction agreement was entered between Illinois and Kentucky, and with respect to that agreement it was concluded that the boundary between the two States would be the north normal pool line, loosely translated the low-water mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.850" offset="2083372">It did not say, it did not specify 1792.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.224" offset="2100821">Kentucky submits that it's talking about the prevailing or current normal pool line on the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.500" offset="2129974">Likewise, we see the same kind of situation with respect to Illinois and Kentucky entering into a maintenance agreement regarding the Cairo bridge, which was constructed in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.126" offset="2176472">In 1954 Kentucky and Illinois officials corresponded regarding where to place the sign on the bridge indicating when you are going to be entering Illinois or leaving Kentucky.</text>

            <text syncTime="540.937" offset="2287649">Kentucky had that 1936 plan analyzed by one of its bridge engineers and of course that plan indicated that the boundary was at Pier B, Station 20 plus 10.</text>

            <text syncTime="577.381" offset="2433412">Likewise there was other situations which have come into play to show that Kentucky is exercising its jurisdiction and its dominion to the north low-water mark on the Ohio River.</text>

            <text syncTime="603.487" offset="2537902">As a result of that subsequent decisions by the Supreme Court of Kentucky, or the highest court in Kentucky at that time, concluded that the State of Kentucky likewise has the authority to lease the bed of the river from the middle of the stream to the low-water mark on the northwestern side of the river.</text>

            <text syncTime="678.342" offset="2837266">Maybe perhaps the bright-line principle that would allow Kentucky to fashion the boundary as it argues today, which has been recognized for 168 years, is California v. Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.370" offset="2885435">I think the bright-line principle in that case is that there is no particular relationship between the origins of a boundary and the legal consequences of acquiescence in that boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.696" offset="2926709">In other words, for 168 years it has been no problem between Illinois and Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.360" offset="2949383">Even as I speak today, the boundary on the river which the parties or the people who work on that river recognize, is the low-water mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.506" offset="2985955">We haven't had any problems with it for 168 years, even though it has been different than the 1792 low-water mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.362" offset="3017406">I think the... at present the Kentucky legislature, with respect to promulgating in its revised statutes the description of the boundary now, talks in terms of allowing the low-water mark on the north side of the river to intersect with the present 1792 low-water mark as we know it from Ohio v. Kentucky, and of course Kentucky v. Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.638" offset="3110506">Merely, the point being is that there has been no problem up until this lawsuit was filed regarding the boundary between the two States.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.703" offset="3146764">At present Kentucky enforces its boating and fishing laws on the entire river to the northwestern side of the river at the low-water mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.490" offset="3185843">For instance, with respect to fishing licenses, the testimony before the Special Master showed that if an individual is fishing in the Ohio River, then Kentucky officials will check that person for his or her license.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.218" offset="3236835">But if that person is fishing from the bank the Kentucky officials will not.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.002" offset="3255956">Moreover the officials from Kentucky testified that there are no Illinois water patrol or Fish and Wildlife personnel on the river.</text>

            <text syncTime="1820.426" offset="7405664">This Court disagreed, siding with Kentucky, and said the decisive question is really the line as it existed in 1792, and that it was fixed at that point and wouldn't change thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.104" offset="7444325">So beginning as early as 100 years ago Kentucky authorities themselves have acknowledged the 1792 line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.239" offset="7472851">Following that decision there have been a number of Kentucky authorities, the earliest is a 1916 Kentucky case where the question was whether or not a small island in the river was within the northern boundary of Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.567" offset="7522170">That Kentucky court cited Indiana v. Kentucky and said the boundary is defined as the low-water mark as it existed when Kentucky became a State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.521" offset="7554039">And that case, I would submit, is of significance to the present controversy since the island was located in the river near Mound City, Illinois.</text>

            <text syncTime="2033.485" offset="8257883">I do know that when you look at the line based on the pre-map, or the pre-dam survey of the Corps of Engineers, you'll see that all along the shoreline of not just Illinois, but Indiana and Ohio, that pre-dam low-water mark is for the most part south of the shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.415" offset="8317546">Another source that... another Kentucky source recognizing the 1792 line was the 1963 attorney general's opinion where the Kentucky Attorney General not only recognized the existence, or the accuracy of the 1792 low-water mark as Kentucky's boundary, he also recognized that because of the dams it would be south of the contemporary northern shoreline due to the general raising of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.070" offset="8416185">The final two Kentucky sources that contain statements incompatible with Kentucky's position here are their two bulletins issued in 1969 and 1972 by the Special Ohio River Boundary Subcommittee of the Kentucky Legislative Research Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.443" offset="8481700">The introduction or forward to the first of those bulletins, Bulletin 81, tells us that this special subcommittee was created specifically to study Kentucky's Ohio River boundary due to litigation during the preceding 150 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.160" offset="8536557">I think it's significant to note that despite Kentucky's claim here that it has always asserted its boundary to be the low-water mark as exists from time to time, that claim was somehow lost on the authors of this... these bulletins, since neither one of those bulletins advanced such a claim on Kentucky's behalf, and both of them recognize the 1792 low-water mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.053" offset="8612103">So, based on those sources running from 1890 through 1972, and those two reports were even issued while Ohio v. Kentucky was pending in this Court, it shows to me first that Kentucky has repeatedly recognized the 1792 line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.575" offset="8678245">Also that... oh, that's true, there was also confusion within Kentucky, because the legislative research commission was saying it's the 1792 line, Kentucky in their answer to Ohio's original complaint said no, it isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.121" offset="8728400">And again, that kind of uncertainty and confusion, I think, fits Illinois' position in this case because you don't have acquiescence where the State claiming the benefit of it can't show a longstanding continuous claim to the boundary they are seeking to have the Court adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.291" offset="8789109">There is additional evidence in the record, I think, also that shows that this uncertainty extends to both States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.516" offset="8813977">The best evidence of that concerns the taxation of the permanent structures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.640" offset="8830487">There are a number of structures built on the Illinois shore that extend into the river, barge loading facilities, coal loading facilities, that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.045" offset="8856087">Illinois identified 15 of these structures, and admittedly we could produce evidence that we were definitely taxing only one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.201" offset="8884717">That was part of a grain-loading facility that is located in Alexander County, Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.133" offset="8908436">Kentucky of course argued this shows that they have exercised exclusive jurisdiction over the river, Illinois hasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.298" offset="8937171">But in fact the record also shows that Kentucky, too, has only taxed one of these 15 structures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.183" offset="8956710">So really what you have, 13 out of 15 structures aren't being taxed by either State.</text>

            <text syncTime="2298.886" offset="9319499">But it's also true that the Kentucky coroner has always given his permission, even in the most recent incident where the victim was still in the river when the Kentucky coroner arrived on the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.112" offset="9356384">And I would submit again this reflects uncertainty in both States, since Kentucky doesn't suggest how one of its coroners could legally delegate authority over a death occurring in the Commonwealth to an Illinois official.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.450" offset="9401732">Plainly it's just neither of them knows what to do exactly, so they work this out between themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="2442.906" offset="9895551">Another example of Illinois' assertion of jurisdiction over the river has to do with the 1927 decision of the Illinois Supreme Court in the Joyce-Watkins case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.236" offset="9940900">That case involved an accident that occurred on a railroad incline, and it occurred some 8 to 10 feet south of the existing Illinois shoreline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.789" offset="9971097">The employer there argued that since it took place south of the shoreline it didn't take place within the State of Illinois, and the Illinois Industrial Commission has no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.064" offset="10004221">The Illinois Supreme Court rejected that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.126" offset="10016446">It cited Indiana v. Kentucky for the proposition that the boundary was the low-water mark on the northwest side of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.511" offset="10041941">But then it also observed that no commission between the States had ever actually plotted that line, and that the dispute before it really wasn't the proper vehicle for resolving an interstate boundary dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.390" offset="10085514">What it did, it was however able to resolve the controversy because it concluded that the low-water mark referred to in Indiana v. Kentucky was the record low-water mark at any given point along the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.106" offset="10132325">In other words, each time the river got lower the boundary moved further south.</text>

            <text syncTime="2536.332" offset="10269207">Well, but we haven't really picked up any shoreline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.273" offset="10281014">Regardless of what line the Court would adopt in this case, it's a water line either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.556" offset="10298150">I don't think either State is going to gain any shoreline one way or the other, no matter how it's concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.558" offset="10318108">But getting back to the Joyce-Watkins case, as the Chief Justice indicated, that's the most favorable possible version of low-water mark the State could have come up with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.406" offset="10357501">That rule was cited by the various authorities within the State of Illinois from 1927 through 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.702" offset="10386758">I would submit that that alone shows that Illinois has not acquiesced to the less favorable line that Kentucky claims in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.267" offset="10416955">So in summing up, Illinois' position in this case is first of all, of course, that the boundary between Illinois and Kentucky is controlled by the prior decisions of this Court in Ohio v. Kentucky and Indiana v. Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.904" offset="10467528">It should be the 1792 low-water mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.038" offset="10476097">Kentucky's defense of acquiescence fails, I believe, first because Kentucky authorities themselves have repeatedly recognized the 1792 low-water mark, and that is... you can juxtapose that to the fact that there is not a single witness or document in the record that says... that Kentucky can point to that says it's the low-water mark as exists from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.309" offset="10553210">That, those words appear in the pleadings before this Court, and nowhere else that I am aware of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.044" offset="10572123">In addition, Illinois rely on the fact that there is evidence of confusion in both States, and once again that's incompatible with a finding of acquiescence based on a continuous claim of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.192" offset="10620710">Finally, Kentucky has based its argument in part on the suggestion that Illinois has never exercised any jurisdiction on the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.765" offset="10651012">I think there are examples in the record at least as concrete as those Kentucky can point to to show that we have exercised jurisdiction over some part of the river south of the existing shoreline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.162" offset="10688524">And that all of those factors add up to a situation where you simply do not have acquiescence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.694" offset="10706706">If the Court has no further questions, that's all I have.</text>

            <text syncTime="2655.474" offset="10745785">Thank you very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.064" offset="10748188">With respect to the 78 permits issued by Illinois officials, Kentucky would indicate from the outset that it cannot stop Illinois from systematically developing its shoreline or its bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.843" offset="10791342">In other words, those riparians along the bank have those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.855" offset="10807329">This is exactly the teachings in New Jersey v. Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.937" offset="10819659">Because you allow the development of the Illinois shoreline, just like in New Jersey v. Delaware, the State which allows that does not abandon the defense of acquiescence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.933" offset="10855708">Secondly, with respect to the Joyce-Watkins case which was the Illinois case, as indicated in Vermont v. New Hampshire, only the U.S. Supreme Court can determine the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.412" offset="10897608">The Illinois appellate court cannot determine that boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.725" offset="10914849">Furthermore, if you read the Joyce-Watkins case extremely closely, you'll find out that they recognized that the boundary is a moving boundary, which is consistent with our theory that it's the low-water mark wherever it may exist from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.941" offset="10963646">Finally, with respect to Illinois' argument that there is uncertainty regarding where the boundary is located, this Court can end that uncertainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.276" offset="10997083">It can conclude that the boundary between the two States is the low-water mark on the northwestern side of the river, which everyone can see.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.821" offset="11023205">Every fisherperson can see.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.443" offset="11029683">Every person having a boat on the river can see.</text>
