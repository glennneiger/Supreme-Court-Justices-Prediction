          <turn speaker="l_peter_farkas" startTime="75.797" stopTime="283.978">
            <label>Mr. L. Peter Farkas</label>
            <text syncTime="75.797" offset="432134">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="78.230" offset="441851">This case concerns in the first instance international remail.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.451" offset="458779">I thought I might open up by saying a little more about remail than we said in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.605" offset="479363">I think it might be helpful to decide both the issues presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.223" offset="497858">I will then discuss the standing issue, and Mr. Larkin will go with the merits of the administrative procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.709" offset="531817">International remail involves the shipment in bulk of large volumes of business documents, publications, and business correspondence to post offices abroad for mailing to the ultimate addressee.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.438" offset="598691">For example, American banks that have overseas depositors, credit card companies that have overseas cardholders have to send the monthly statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.550" offset="663161">Rather than go to the post office, affixing U.S. Postal Service's international air rate, and sending them off to... for delivery abroad, under international remail the courier will pick up those monthly statements in bulk, will... they would be unstamped.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.665" offset="763576">They would be put on an air plane that evening, and they would be delivered to a foreign post office the following morning, where they would be mailed at... usually at negotiated rates for ultimate delivery by that post office or by another foreign post office in some other country.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.543" offset="839122">The international remail involves a savings of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.482" offset="866916">Some shipments are delivered in half the time it would take the United States Postal Service to deliver, to deliver the same correspondence.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.140" offset="917489">It involves a savings in money.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.325" offset="934207">Some of... the record shows that savings of up to 50 percent exist in certain market for delivery by international remail.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.633" offset="971510">These savings of time and money save American jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.752" offset="991990">The record shows that if remail were unavailable that certain publishers would move their printing operations abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.142" offset="1033577">Under the example I noted before, if remail were unavailable, that is, if low cost, reliable and quick service for delivery of statements were unavailable, the banks or credit card companies may think... start thinking about moving their computer billing operations abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.139" offset="1113512">So in short, this saves, saves American jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.043" offset="1145172">It promotes exports, and it does so without necessarily cutting into the business of the Postal Service because international trade is not a zero sum game.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.136" offset="1197522">Now let me turn to the standing issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.004" offset="1216957">The... in 1979 the United States Postal Service suspended the operation of the restrictions on private carriage of letters--</text>

            <text syncTime="286.061" offset="1273172">I'm having a little trouble hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="296.600" offset="1315386">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.636" offset="1323536">In 1979, the United States Postal Service suspended the restrictions on private carriage of letters by... and that... those laws... the restrictions on private carriage of letters are referred to the postal monopoly laws, also referred to in the briefs as the private express statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.501" offset="1423011">The 1979 suspension related to both domestic urgent letters and international urgent letters.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.357" offset="1458433">Soon after the suspension, the practice... the international side of the urgent letter rule was used both to deliver urgent letters to... individually to foreign addressees and also to deliver international letters, urgent letters in bulk, to foreign post offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.007" offset="1565012">In 1985 the United States Postal Service took exception to the delivery of letters, urgent letters, to foreign post offices and initiated a rule making to prohibit that practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.534" offset="1623109">The users of remail, the remailers themselves with the help of the administration and members of Congress, participated in that rule making and the... eventually the Postal Service turned around and issued a rule that said remail was okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.697" offset="1703775">It was lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.513" offset="1710985">The American Postal Workers Union and the National Association of Letter Carriers then sued the Postal Service, saying that the suspension was improper and therefore violated the postal monopoly laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.492" offset="1778903">They alleged as their injury the possibility of losses of jobs, postal employment jobs, and the district court found that to meet the Article III injuring fact test but dismissed the case on the grounds that the postal employees were not in the zone of interest of the postal monopoly laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.761" offset="1891961">The court of appeals reversed, and we're here on petition for certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="466.277" offset="1994047">In order to... under the zone of interest test, in order to look at whether... one looks to the statute and its legislative history to determine whether a party asserting a violation of an act was the party who's rightfully entitled to pursue that suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.677" offset="2095716">The private express statutes were originated in the late 19... late 1700's as a general tax provisions and as a means of paying for post roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.687" offset="2151722">The only time that Congress ever debated the postal monopoly laws were in 1845.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.357" offset="2182338">And at that time, there were two... two reasons advanced for the postal monopolies.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.493" offset="2202922">The first one was to help bind and build the frontier and connect it to the rest of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.582" offset="2231239">The second reason was to control the flow of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.586" offset="2259347">At the time it was believed unfair that some individuals might take advantage of commercially useful information that travelled faster than the mails could carry them.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.210" offset="2301770">Never in the history of any consideration of, of a postal monopoly laws were the interests of postal employees ever considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.535" offset="2355060">Therefore, we contend that the postal employees are not within the zone of interest of the postal monopoly laws and the case was properly dismissed by the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.159" offset="2405633">The unions here have not seriously challenged... in fact they appear to have abandoned the contention that the private express statutes give them standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.252" offset="2457982">They now turn to the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 as the appropriate statute to look to for standing purposes for zone of interest purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.941" offset="2500718">We believe that the Postal Reorganization Act does not confer standing because it was no more a postal employment act... it no more promoted postal employment... Congress no more considered postal employment... that is, in numbers... in promulgating that act--</text>

            <text syncTime="662.787" offset="2780124">In short, the Postal Reorganization Act was intended to make the Post Office into a more businesslike... Government-owned corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.547" offset="2839161">The unions opposed the Postal Reorganization Act because they ended Civil Service protection for employees, and it was predicted to reduce postal employment in the long run because it was predicted to, to help the Post Office automate and help the Post Office get the Congress off its back to keep it from automating.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.447" offset="2946785">And, therefore, the purposes of the act, of the 1970 act, do not bring the postal employees within the zone of interest of the private express statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="873.307" offset="3622207">The exception would be where the matter is jurisdictional, and we think that the way this Court discussed this type of issue in the case of Block v. Community Nutrition Institute that it treated these types of issues as being... as the Court said in Block... in effect jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.133" offset="3685528">The last footnote in the Block case, footnote 4, was the footnote in which the Court said that it declined in that case to resolve the Article III question that was before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.524" offset="3731086">The question in that case under Article III was whether the plaintiff's net lawsuit had standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.195" offset="3753760">There was an additional question in that case of whether or not review was precluded under the APA.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.766" offset="3779987">The Court resolved the case by looking to the preclusion issue and not resolving the standing issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.772" offset="3804020">So we think that both what the Court said in the Block case and what the Court did in the Block case indicates that the Court believes an issue like this is one that can be raised in this sort of matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="942.285" offset="3898060">For example, sometimes the word jurisdictional is used when really the word authority is an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.755" offset="3915928">Sometimes the word jurisdictional is used to discuss threshold issues which would normally not be jurisdictional in the Article III sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="959.647" offset="3967546">But the peculiar factual scenario in the Block case tends to indicate, I think, that the Court meant that in the stronger jurisdictional sense because there was in fact an Article III question that was presented by the Government in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.489" offset="4022926">We brought a challenge on that type of ground to the decision below.</text>

            <text syncTime="1284.690" offset="5267713">--Well, you... the zone of interest test wouldn't be applied differently, but as you say, you may or may not want to apply it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.159" offset="5289551">Now, in our view they haven't satisfied the zone of interest test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.195" offset="5301776">The private express statutes are the relevant statutes to look to in this sort of context, and the unions cannot make out a satisfactory showing that they are within the zone of interest of the private express statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.151" offset="5341587">For that reason I believe the unions have in part also tried to raise what they call a common law, non-statutory type of claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.823" offset="5368232">Now, this Court has in some limited circumstances allowed that type of showing to be sufficient, basically in two types of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.394" offset="5398534">One is where someone can satisfy the prerequisites for obtaining mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.048" offset="5413162">That the unions cannot do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.814" offset="5420163">In fact, they've made no real effort to try to satisfy the strict requirements for mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.583" offset="5435314">And the other is best illustrated by the Court's discussion in the case of Stark v. Wickard... is a situation in which Congress has implicitly granted someone the right to bring a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.141" offset="5473558">That also is not the type of showing that we think the unions can make out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.176" offset="5489649">That is essentially the type of showing a union would have to make out to satisfy the Cort v. Ash test, and we don't think they can satisfy that very strict showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.448" offset="5522772">So if you look at it as a matter of the zone of interests analysis, we don't the unions can satisfy that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.685" offset="5551716">They can't show that they are within the zone of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.387" offset="5558508">And to be perfectly candid, I think no one is within the zone of interest except the Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.839" offset="5576271">The purpose of the private express statutes was to protect the Postal Service's ability to obtain sufficient revenue so that it could serve the Nation at a uniform rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.045" offset="5613156">It wasn't designed to protect the unions or postal employees, which... and the concept of postal employees unions would have been unheard of in 1845, when the statutes essentially took their current shape... and the statutes weren't designed to protect anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.371" offset="5670416">It was designed basically to protect the union... excuse me, the Postal Service and, therefore, the public as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.942" offset="5688702">So therefore, it's really the Postal Service that fits within the... the zone of interest of the private express statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.696" offset="5715765">And as we've explained in our brief and I've tried to summarize here, the unions also cannot satisfy the necessary prerequisites for making out an implied right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.868" offset="5748470">If I can, then, I'd like to say a few words about the merits of the case in the remaining time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.987" offset="5764875">And that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.356" offset="5770413">We think that this record here is an excellent example of precisely how Congress intended the rule-making process to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.510" offset="5799043">The Postal Service started out with a rule, a proposed rule, in which it believe that the international remailing practice was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.615" offset="5827465">After hearing from considerable commentary by both members of the public and... as well as other Government officials, the Postal Service changed its mind in reliance on those comments and ultimately adopted the international remailing rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.839" offset="5876261">The unions have, I think, essentially two arguments that they've made to try to criticize the Postal Service in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.910" offset="5900607">The first is that the rule is not likely to benefit the public as a whole and is likely to benefit those businesses that engage in international business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.433" offset="5934671">I think that's a misdirected inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.885" offset="5944493">The question is not whether the entire public can make use of a suspension, but is whether the suspension will benefit the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.039" offset="5969153">In this case, the Postal Service concluded that it would for a variety of reasons benefit the public, and that was based upon information from parties not only in the private sector, as I said, but also from Secretary of Commerce, the Chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisors, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and the Attorney General of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.666" offset="6039579">Those comments indicated that this will help American businesses sell goods overseas, which is in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.404" offset="6066537">The second challenge that the unions have raised is that the postal service did not adequately consider the potential revenue effect of the suspension on its ability to serve the public as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.426" offset="6102691">And we think that criticism is unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.010" offset="6108960">The Postal Service admitted both at the out--</text>

            <text syncTime="1502.032" offset="6137068">It's unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.682" offset="6139680">The Postal Service at the outset and at the conclusion of the process admitted that it did not have the hard data that it would have liked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.835" offset="6164340">It asked the public for that data, but it wasn't forthcoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.870" offset="6176460">The Postal Service therefore faced a decision, because making no decision... that is, not adopting a suspension or deferring a suspension would be as much of a decision as allowing suspension to go into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.976" offset="6216898">What the Postal Service did was use a worst-case scenario.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.928" offset="6228705">It took a very high over-estimate of the potential loss that it would suffer, and using that over-estimate of its potential loss, nonetheless came to the conclusion that the potential benefits out weighed the potential loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.819" offset="6284189">And that's not an irrational result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.688" offset="6291713">Under a public interest standard, an agency is entitled to make that sort of assessment, particularly since the agency has the ability over time to monitor the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.543" offset="6323164">If in fact it were to prove that this would be too financially debilitating, the Postal Service would have the ability to modify the suspension or repeal it entire... in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.732" offset="6359840">But what the respondents would have us do in this case is, in the absence of complete and perfect data, take no action at all, basically to stymie the agency until it had the type of data that, I'm told by the Postal Service, it really can't ever get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.707" offset="6411771">In those circumstances, that would simply be forcing upon the Postal Service a rule that's inconsistent with this Court's decisions in cases such as Listeners Guild.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.563" offset="6443223">For these sorts of reasons and the ones laid out in our brief, we ask the Court to uphold the Postal Service's decision in this case on the ground that it was eminently reasonable and satisfied all of the requirements of the APA.</text>

            <text syncTime="1613.652" offset="6583553">The Postal Service included its most forthright way of resolving this problem was to go ahead and adopt a regulation setting forth its considered view of the matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1639.951" offset="6688774">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.271" offset="6714060">I'd like to begin by just following up on Justice Scalia's last question and the response.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.925" offset="6736630">This case is not, and I really want to emphasize this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.544" offset="6755125">This case is not about the legality or the illegality of international remailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.697" offset="6775709">Mr. Farkas' clients were in business before the suspension, and regardless of what happens here, they're going to continue to be in business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.184" offset="6805698">This case really has to be understood in the context of the 1979 urgent letter suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.374" offset="6838403">That's the suspension under which the international remail practice grew up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.711" offset="6859824">That suspension prescribed two tests, certain delivery deadlines which had to be satisfied and it prescribed an alternative cost test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.752" offset="6903918">The private courier had to charge a certain minimum amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.538" offset="6919069">And if that minimum amount was charge then there was presumably a reason why the mailer wanted to use a private courier rather than the Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.309" offset="6958149">That was the balance the Postal Service struck to meet the needs of mailers who needed to go outside the Postal Service while at the same time safe guarding the monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.301" offset="7006109">What the regulation here did, and this is the point that petitioners' arguments are missing, is to release the international remailers and their customers from those requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.923" offset="7052607">To simplify it, there's a minimum requirement of a charge of twice the applicable postage or $3... let's just say $3... for a given mailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.529" offset="7095030">Under the international remail suspension, that charge is no longer in effect for this one group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.318" offset="7126273">And it was that that we... that we attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.586" offset="7139334">It was the... what we saw as an arbitrary and capricious release of this one group from the same requirements that are applicable to all other mailers who wish to use private carriage rather than the Postal Service, and it's that aspect of the case that we contended was unjustified by anything in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1788.760" offset="7283948">The issue with respect to revenue loss, which was the primary concern of the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.413" offset="7310593">It's not simply whether or not the Postal Service forecasted or attempted to forecast how much revenue would be lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.785" offset="7344134">The question is the failure of the Postal Service to examine the economic tradeoffs that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.839" offset="7364300">For example, international mail, just like any other class of mail, is expected to make a contribution to the maintenance of the Postal Service's institutional infrastructure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.147" offset="7417590">The Court has examined the rate-making procedures set forth in the Postal Reorganization Act in the National Greeting Card case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.503" offset="7450922">And essentially there are two types of costs which arise in the Postal Service rate-making scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.692" offset="7479762">One are attributable costs, those costs which can be attributed to a specific class of mail, and other cost, which is simply assigned on an equitable basis, based on statutory criteria, to all the classes of mail in order to preserve the Postal Service's institutional infrastructure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.618" offset="7543396">Now, while international mail is outside the scheme of the Postal Rate Commission, it has historically... and the evidence we submitted in the record makes that clear... it has historically made a contribution to the, to the Postal Service's institutional costs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1909.602" offset="7767318">I think it's consistent with the function of the zone of interest tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.090" offset="7789365">The zone of interest test, as most recently articulated in Clarke, is a guide to the Court to determine who is an appropriate plaintiff, who should the Court hear from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.696" offset="7831788">It's, in effect, to screen out inappropriate plaintiffs, those plaintiffs whose interests are so marginal or inconsistent with the statute that presumption is fair that that particular plaintiff would not be a reasonable plaintiff for the Court to hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.692" offset="7907752">But once someone has satisfied the zone of interest test and comes before the Court as a reasonable plaintiff, I think the cases then allow that plaintiff to challenge the legality under the statute without regard to the specifics of his interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.052" offset="7973162">Just to finish up the point on costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.587" offset="7995314">The question that the Postal Service did not examine was what effect would the loss of revenue that it forecasted have on the remaining users of the mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.894" offset="8032513">This is very, very simplistic for anyone who is familiar with the rate-making process, but the Postal Service calculated the cost under its worst-case scenario as a little bit over 3 percent of its total revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.219" offset="8085802">That's an enormous amount of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.987" offset="8096878">3 percent, if it were distributed evenly over the rest of the rate structure, could mean, for example, close to a penny increase on the first class stamp.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.343" offset="8134286">The question is what is the rationale for making the remaining users of the mail pay ultimately more for their postage so that the customers of the international remailers could have, in essence, free access to the remailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.852" offset="8200323">Maybe there is a public interest rationale.</text>

            <text syncTime="2181.948" offset="8856728">I think there are a couple of questions that are raised by the urgent letter exception, and one is whether or not there was any diversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.269" offset="8885985">The philosophical assumption of the urgent letter exemption was that there was a type of service that the public needed the Postal Service couldn't provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.624" offset="8923497">So, in theory at least, the mail volume that was generated by the urgent letter exemption is not volume that the Postal Service was already processing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2207.896" offset="8960591">It's also... now I'm really just speculating but I think it's fair... one could theorize that the marketing activities of the express mail industry have increased the overall market, and possibly increased the Postal Service's express mail business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.624" offset="9035406">So it would be difficult to forecast the loss in revenue or job impact from the urgent letter exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.528" offset="9059020">As to... briefly on the question of judicial review and whether or not the... this case can probably brought under the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.120" offset="9125476">The only justification that's been offered for raising that issue for the first time is the notion that this is in essence a jurisdictional claim, and the authority for that proposition is Block v. Community Nutrition Institute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.999" offset="9192976">I would point out that what Block was focusing on is whether the substantive statute precluded review in its entirety, not simply a question of whether the APA was applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.807" offset="9240206">And it was on that basis that the Court characterized the preclusion... the issue as jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.079" offset="9273225">There's no basis in the case law for treating the availability of the APA as jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.582" offset="9303318">In fact, Califano v. Sanders settled that the APA was not a jurisdictional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.200" offset="9325783">This... the jurisdictional statutes involved here were the Federal question statute and section 409 of the Postal Reorganization Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.806" offset="9360160">That's what creates jurisdiction in the district courts for bringing this lawsuit and seeking the relief that we sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.662" offset="9387641">At that point, I would point out, it's the Government that focused and defined the issues in terms of the APA zone of interest test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.816" offset="9420242">So I think there's no basis for that issue being raised here for the first time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2337.442" offset="9478756">As I indicated in earlier responses, the standing question as the case now... as the case now appears before the Court is defined solely in terms of the zone of interest test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.739" offset="9551899">The zone of interest test focuses on whether the plaintiff is arguably within the zone of interest to be protected or regulated by the statute in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.564" offset="9607174">Now, the argument advanced by petitioner in this case focuses primarily on the notion that the private express statutes are different from the Postal Reorganization Act, which is the organic statute involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.925" offset="9676660">And we're claiming a violation of the postal... of the private express statutes, which date back to the seven... 1700's, when there were no postal unions, and therefore we couldn't be within the zone of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.150" offset="9721590">I'd like to address that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.435" offset="9730681">First of all, let's start with what it is we're contending, because I think that's the beginning of a standing inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.172" offset="9757639">Our contention on the merits is that the Postal Service acted in excess of its authority, that it abused its discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.194" offset="9793688">It acted arbitrarily in... and capriciously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.563" offset="9807167">The source of the authority to act that we claim the Postal Service exceeded, or the source of discretion which we say it abused, is 39 U.S.C. 601(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.405" offset="9874563">That is the one provision which the Postal Service claims is the source of its authority to suspend the private express statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.095" offset="9905388">The argument that is being made is that 601 should not be considered part of the Postal Reorganization Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.099" offset="9937362">It should be considered some sort of 19th century enactment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2550.578" offset="10331288">In 1864, Congress passed another statute which authorized the Postmaster General to suspend the 1852 law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2960.843" offset="11972300">Well, there was no finding at any time by the court that the Glass-Steigal Act was designed to protect the interests of businesses in the stock brokerage business.</text>

            <text syncTime="3184.773" offset="12868091">The result of that would be that the rates charged by the Postal Service would skyrocket above and beyond the rate of inflation, which would have a devastating impact on volume.</text>

            <text syncTime="3206.120" offset="12953460">3 percent loss of revenue, if that's all that the Postal Service is talking about, could very well be the difference between whether or not rates go up more than or less than the rate of inflation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3234.539" offset="13067145">Well, the problem with that is that the Postal Service has to maintain a fixed, nationwide infrastructure, which prevents it, I think, from responding to competition out on the fringes in those particular areas where rates... where rates... where a lower rate could be charged by a private business while competing with the Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.655" offset="13167559">That's essentially the rationale that was articulated in the 1973 Governor's Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.277" offset="13198070">It's the rationale that underscores the conditions which the Postal Service imposed when it suspended the private express statutes for urgent letters, and it's that basic rationale that the Postal Service ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.805" offset="13272153">There's one other point I want to make, just to follow up on Justice Scalia's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.507" offset="13290962">One of the... another one of the policies of the Postal Reorganization Act which I may have neglected to mention is the requirement that the Postal Service break even, that it... it's... it cannot run at a loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.684" offset="13343729">It cannot make a profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.200" offset="13349789">Over time the Postal Service is to break even.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.302" offset="13362119">And the basic thrust of that, in terms of the 1970 reorganization, was to ensure that the Postal Service would no longer ultimately have to depend on subsidies from the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.276" offset="13406109">That's another aspect of the Postal Reorganization Act which is dependent on the maintenance of the private express statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3390.506" offset="13690949">Mr. Secular mentioned that the Postal Service had failed to consider the economic tradeoffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.793" offset="13716131">At Joint Appendix, page 72 to 73, the Postal Service did state... give notice of the estimates of $25 million to $250 million in gross revenue losses and net losses of $3 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.536" offset="13775063">The postal unions failed to present any evidence, contrary evidence, of tradeoffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.059" offset="13801185">There's no reason for the Postal Service to have considered evidence or arguments that weren't raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.094" offset="13821352">As to the APA argument, it's really not an APA argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.665" offset="13839638">It's a reviewability argument, and independently of the APA, there's a presumption of reviewability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.984" offset="13864924">And there's nothing in the private express statutes that precludes reviewability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.020" offset="13881016">In fact, the court, as early as 1921 in the Burleson case, recognized the right to review Postal Service... at that time, Postmaster General's... administrative determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.530" offset="13931066">When the APA was passed, there was... it intended to broaden, not limit, reviewability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.100" offset="13953322">The APA did not include the postal... the Post Office in either section 551 or 701 under the list of exempt agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.040" offset="13993133">In 1970, when the Postal Reorganization Act was passed, the Congress did not amend 551 or 701.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.395" offset="14030540">Therefore, 410, section 410 of the PRA, has to be limited to the purposes of the PRA and do not overcome the presumption of reviewability of administrative actions under the private express statutes.</text>
