            <label>Mr. Keith B. Nordyre</label>
            <text syncTime="63.733" offset="384599">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.483" offset="391599">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="67.135" offset="398287">The question before the Court today is whether or not the State of Louisiana may, for the sole purpose of executing an inmate, forcibly medicate a mentally ill inmate with psychotropic drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.152" offset="442277">The Louisiana Supreme Court, confirming conviction and sentence on direct appeal, restated that Louisiana does not execute the insane, and invited inquiry as to competency to be executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.471" offset="495567">The trial court on its own motion determined that Mr. Perry has met the threshold test of Ford v. Wainwright as adopted by Louisiana and held a hearing to determine competency to be executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.890" offset="549275">The result of that hearing was an order which we contend is without any limits, without any exercise of medical judgment, without review, without any ability to terminate medication, that is, without the medical approach that this Court has previously used.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.930" offset="609461">That order said that the medical staff of the Louisiana State Penitentiary should medicate Mr. Perry with the drug Haldol solely for the purpose of preparing him for execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.446" offset="647495">Mr. Perry has schizoaffective disorder, which is a major mental illness that is incurable.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.340" offset="671005">There are two major components to this disorder, the first of which is a mood component... we commonly think of it as a bipolar disorder or manic depressive... and the second is a psychotic component where Mr. Perry has delusions, has auditory hallucinations, and very often does not know where he is.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.654" offset="756269">It's also marked by very strong ambivalence, meaning that he cannot say consistently and know consistently from one minute to the next the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.199" offset="794512">The classic example that appears throughout the record is Mr. Perry on the one hand will say, I killed my mother and my father, and within the same sentence will say, for $20,000 I'll tell you who killed my mother and my father.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.739" offset="848638">The Louisiana Supreme Court initially stayed the forcible medication order in this case and then denied writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.744" offset="880716">Under Louisiana law a writ denial is not to be considered an expression of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.167" offset="902346">The tension in this case as Petitioner sees it is the pitting of the... the medication model of treatment versus the punitive model of treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="238.627" offset="1084158">The problem with him simply doing that is that 830.1 sets up a whole panoply of due process protections virtually similar to the Harper decision last year.</text>

            <text syncTime="3222.703" offset="13020550">They adopted exactly the approach that the AMA would suggest in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.045" offset="13037895">There is a legislative task force history of that statute that is available and subsequent to Ford v. Wainwright, that statute was reenacted and they commute after one opportunity at a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.145" offset="13090244">The statute does say that a person is not incompetent merely because of the continued administration of psychotropic medication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.459" offset="13119501">But what I suggest that suggests is somebody that would otherwise be sane even without the medication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.932" offset="13137474">Secondly, turning to the Turner v. Safley analysis that counsel suggested, Turner simply doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.635" offset="13164223">Turner is a method of analysis that applies to a prison regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.719" offset="13184599">This is a statute that we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.209" offset="13190555">And if it's not a statute it's certainly the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.823" offset="13201004">Justice Marshall asked about the injections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.835" offset="13213020">They are in fact injections and the Haldoldeconate is a large enough injection where they have to be broken down into several shots each time in order to give them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.390" offset="13247292">The question of whether it was good for him and it doesn't appear anywhere in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.204" offset="13270489">I still think it doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.356" offset="13275087">And the reason that I think counsel says that it appears in the record is that the questions that were posed were, can you make him competent to be executed?</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.108" offset="13310091">The questions that were directed to the physicians on the witness stand had to do with competency to be executed and not whether or not any of these medications were in Mr. Perry's best interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.785" offset="13340811">We likewise have spoken to Mr. Perry, not the physicians, in the last 2 weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.698" offset="13360455">He believes that the monthly shots he's getting are lethal injections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.661" offset="13376337">Thank you.</text>
