            <label>Mr. Richard K. Willard</label>
            <text syncTime="133.909" offset="665875">The court of appeals, although it rejected generalist jurisdiction, found specific jurisdiction, because it said there was a sufficient nexus in this case between the Carnival's advertising activities in the State of Washington and the resulting... and the ultimate accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.769" offset="729300">They applied a test of but for causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.310" offset="739436">The court said that but for Carnival's advertising and promotional activities, Mrs. Shute would not have gone on this cruise and but for going on the cruise, of course, she would not have been injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.158" offset="778828">We submit that this connection is too tenuous to support the assertion of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.561" offset="800458">And we recognize the State of Washington has an interest in providing a forum for its residents who may want to pursue claims for injuries they have suffered while traveling out of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.748" offset="845179">But this Court has never held that that kind of interest is sufficient to support an assertion of jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.852" offset="877571">No matter how strong the State's interest in providing a convenient forum for its plaintiffs to pursue claims, those claims still must arise out of or relate to contacts with the forum State by the defendant in order to support an assertion of long arm jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.463" offset="940056">This Court has been mindful of the territorial limits on State power in connection with the assertion of personal jurisdiction, and those territorial contacts here are pretty close to their nadir.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.831" offset="985509">Here we have a nonresident corporation that does not have continuous and systematic contacts in a case involving acts of negligence which occurred out-of-state and which caused injury out-of-state.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.357" offset="1031589">Thus, this case is readily distinguishable for situations where a defendant, for example, may send a libellous publications into a State or may send a defective product into a State where it causes injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.137" offset="1082789">In this case, all of the acts on which liability is based and all of the injuries that support the claim for damages occurred out-of-state.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.302" offset="1123436">The sole contact of the defendant with the State involved the advertising and promotional activities and the relationship between these activities and the allegations of negligence and failing to maintain a safe passageway through the galley are so slight as to create really a virtual fiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.144" offset="1194802">This case is many ways like the case of Kulko against Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.627" offset="1216745">In that case, as the Court recalled, you rejected an assertion of jurisdiction in a case where, admittedly, the marriage of the parties had originated in California during a brief visit, but thereafter they moved to New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.898" offset="1277767">Later, the wife moved back to California and the Court held that California could not assert long arm jurisdiction over the husband, who had remained in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.735" offset="1317160">Now it could be said that the marriage in that case was a but for cause of the subsequent lawsuit to establish a divorce decree, since but for a marriage you do not have a divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.100" offset="1358642">But the Court did not devote much attention and found it unnecessary even to seriously consider the thought that the prior marriage in California, even though that sort of a but for cause could form the basis for the establishment of long arm jurisdiction over the husband in a lawsuit involving, among other things, child support and establishment of the marriage decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.035" offset="1442338">So, for those reasons, we would submit that the contacts here were too tenuous and unrelated to the cause of action to support an assertion of personal jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="351.990" offset="1538156">If the plaintiff here were... had shown that she relied on the advertising to find the safe and reliable ship line, could you say that there's some connection between the negligence cause of action and the advertising that she saw?</text>
            <text syncTime="371.925" offset="1617881">I recognize that those aren't shown in the case, but just to test whether or not it's arising out of or related to.</text>

            <text syncTime="378.568" offset="1644526">Well, certainly, Justice Kennedy, if she were to sue on the basis of fraudulent or false advertising, that would be like the Keeton case in which the contact with the forum gave rise to the cause of action, because the advertising itself would cause the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.976" offset="1702100">In your hypothetical, though, the advertising would not be a necessary part of the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.273" offset="1731253">She might allege that the advertising promised a safe ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.684" offset="1748911">But of course she could sue for negligence whether the advertising promised a safe ship or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="409.239" offset="1767197">Well, but the context... do the context have to be necessary to the cause of action under your test?</text>
            <text syncTime="413.910" offset="1785796">It has to be related to I thought our cases say.</text>

            <text syncTime="419.444" offset="1807948">That is, it should relate to the substance of the cause of action and not just a sort of a narrative relationship in which it's something that is part of the story that's told.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.199" offset="1842952">And so, although she could have drafted her complaint in a way that might have indicated that the advertising somehow contained a promise of a safe ship, unless she were actually suing for a breach of warranty or something like that, it would be necessary to a cause of action for negligence.</text>

Congress has never provided a special rule of service for foreign defendants in this kind of a case, and so as long as Rule 4(e) provides that the State long arm statute is the basis for service of process, this Court's decision in the Omni case indicates that that would be the form of analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1048.074" offset="4322495">Well, one reason why it is reasonable to have a single forum is that the time a cruise occurs it's difficult to know where all of the witnesses in evidence will be months or years later when a lawsuit occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.393" offset="4371814">For example, the respondents seems to suggest that if the designated forum had been the place where the ship departed and returned, that would have been more reasonable, by analogy to the Hodes case which designated Naples.</text>

            <text syncTime="1084.869" offset="4469721">And so that is more likely to be a forum where at least some documents, some witnesses will be available.</text>

            <text syncTime="1093.234" offset="4503158">Its ships frequently land and take off there, so employees of the shipping line may be thought to be more readily available there than they would be somewhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.031" offset="4538371">But back to the question, if I may, of whether it's reasonable to select one forum rather than saying every passenger can bring a lawsuit in their own home city.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.858" offset="4577659">Many situations can arise in which an incident involves passengers from all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.952" offset="4602005">Carnival carries hundreds of thousands of passengers from all of the states and many foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.615" offset="4624680">And if each of them could go home and file a lawsuit about an injury, there would be a litigation on these conditions all over the country, maybe arising out of the same incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.640" offset="4664804">We cite the California... the Williams litigation in California in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.916" offset="4685911">And that case, which Carnival has sought a stay from this Court and announced an intention to file a petition for certiorari, involves this same forum selection issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.773" offset="4729274">There, over 200 passengers from a number of different States filed a lawsuit claiming to have been injured in an incident of rough passage on the same cruise from Los Angeles to Puerto Vallarto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.838" offset="4773578">Now, if all of them could go home and litigate the same issue in different State courts or Federal courts, that would be very inefficient and burdensome.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.963" offset="4806074">And so by designating a signal forum in the passenger ticket, Carnival's designation serves the interest of judicial efficiency as well as reducing its costs by providing that all the litigation should take place in one place.</text>

            <text syncTime="1215.305" offset="4991439">So there would be some cases where that could happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.618" offset="5004709">So, in summary, our view is that it makes sense in a situation where a cruise line operates with passengers from all different States as well as different countries to designate in the ticket a single forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.548" offset="5064373">And certainly if a single forum had to be designated, Florida is the most reasonable forum that could have been selected in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1251.279" offset="5135321">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.983" offset="5166146">This is a case brought in admiralty in the western district of Washington dealing with an injury to a Washington resident which occurred in international waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.900" offset="5213793">The question for this Court is whether that case can be brought where the plaintiff purchased her tickets, where she resides, where the witnesses mainly reside, or will she have to travel 3,000 miles to probably the farthest point in the continental United States from where she resides to try this case and to do so in a State where there are no witnesses which are relevant to this lawsuit and which, in effect, have very little to do with this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.897" offset="5317760">The petitioner has taken the position, both in oral argument and in its brief, that due process only allows it to be sued where its corporate headquarters are currently located which is in Miami, Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.436" offset="5367916">We take the position that due process, based upon their contacts with the State of Washington, allow them to be sued in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.543" offset="5400412">And the forum selection clause I will address a little bit later, but we take the position that it essentially shouldn't be enforced in this case, because it is unreasonable under the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.588" offset="5448582">Counsel's correct that the contacts with the State of Washington are primarily promotional and advertising in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.105" offset="5486616">However, many of these... some of these promotions took place in the State of Washington... these seminars for travel agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.320" offset="5511484">He left, however, the very important ones which are the sales of these tickets in the State of Washington which occur there, and in addition, the purchasing of travel agents' services, essentially, by paying a commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.499" offset="5564252">These are significant contacts, and they are systematic and they are continuous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.934" offset="5589956">While the Ninth Circuit did not feel they were sufficient for the exertion of general jurisdiction, we've never taken that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.216" offset="5615034">But in any case, we feel that a specific jurisdiction is warranted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.221" offset="5635096">This case has already been to the Ninth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit, because of a question... because State laws play such a large part in jurisdictional questions involving the Long Arm Act, certified a question to the Washington Supreme Court which specifically asked them if the long arm statute would encompass this case if the conduct of the petitioner was sufficient in order to invoke long arm jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.709" offset="5757036">Specifically, does this accident arise out of their contacts with the State?</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.105" offset="5786606">In a unanimous decision, the Washington Supreme Court decided that as a matter of State law--</text>

            <text syncTime="1497.220" offset="6119093">But your client bought it... bought the ticket from a travel agent, but the travel... but the sale by Carnival Lines was made in Florida.</text>

            <text syncTime="1506.586" offset="6156604">I suppose it's a matter of one's view, Justice Scalia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.637" offset="6168725">One is... my client paid her money to a travel agent and received her money... received her ticket from the same travel agent, who was an agent paid a commission by Carnival.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.221" offset="6203102">Carnival's assertion is that, because the ticket is printed in Miami and that it is... the money is eventually received in Miami, that the sale took place there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.708" offset="6241032">Our contention is is that's a rather illogical way of looking at it, because cars are made in Detroit and the money finally... usually winds up there, too, but that doesn't mean the sale occurs there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.635" offset="6280738">It occurs where you pay your money and where you receive the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.207" offset="6291083">And in this case my client paid her money in Washington and received the ticket in Washington from the agent of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.063" offset="6318459">And so we contend that the sale and numerous sales... other sales take place in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.926" offset="6341865">And I should point out the travel agent in this case was specifically trained by Carnival at seminars in the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="2597.798" offset="10521352">In this case, I think what the Ninth Circuit meant when they said it was not bargained for and was unreasonable was that because it's not bargained for, we can look at it and say, is this reasonable?</text>

            <text syncTime="2617.390" offset="10599720">And we cited the Carnival Cruise Lines v. Superior Court case, which is the Williams case counsel referred to, in which he says... in which it's made pretty clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="3030.492" offset="12252226">The one question I wanted to address was the one of the choice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.653" offset="12268840">The Ninth Circuit did hold, and it's in their opinion in page 21a of the appendix to the petition, that Federal law governs the validity of the forum selection clause, citing Manetti-Farrow and a Ninth Circuit decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.892" offset="12325787">And then the court went on to say, thus, the starting point for analysis is the Supreme Court's decision in the Bremen.</text>

            <text syncTime="3076.982" offset="12438113">But it cited the Bremen, so it seemed to indicate that that was... it was deciding that as a matter of Federal admiralty law rather than looking to State law as the source of that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.048" offset="12474371">Similarly, we did cite in our opening brief at page 21 in footnote 18 two decisions of this Court to the effect that the steamship passenger ticket contract would be governed by Federal admiralty law, one actually as recently as 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.408" offset="12543857">So our position is that this is a question of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.169" offset="12558903">Now the question of whether Federal law would control if this case were in State court or perhaps if it had been brought on the law side of a Federal court is one to which we think this Court's decisions in the past have indicated Federal law would control, and we think that's the better view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.822" offset="12625463">But obviously it's not presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.732" offset="12633091">It was brought as an admiralty case in Federal court.</text>
