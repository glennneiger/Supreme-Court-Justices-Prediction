            <text syncTime="11.808" offset="177605">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.593" offset="192652">This case involves the interpretation of Section 401(c) of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, which places a duty upon unions to distribute, on behalf of candidates for union office, campaign literature upon their reasonable requests.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.804" offset="261511">In posing the issue of how to determine what is reasonable request, the case raises issues involving the competing policies underlying LMRDA, which are the furtherance of union democracy and the prevention of unnecessary interference with the internal affairs of unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.016" offset="338415">We submit that the holding of the Fourth Circuit, which held that the MM&amp;P's election procedure was not entitled to consideration in determining whether Respondent's request to distribute literature was reasonable, not only unduly impairs the MM&amp;P's right to govern its own affairs, but also ultimately is contrary to union democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.512" offset="424410">The case arose in the summer of 1988 when Brown, stating that he wished to be a candidate for president in the upcoming election of MM&amp;P officers, made a request to the union to be permitted to disseminate literature prior to the convention, which was scheduled for August of 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.510" offset="504345">The union denied the request based upon its longstanding election procedure set forth in its constitution, which provides that the right to mailing begins only when the ballot committee of rank-and-file members that runs the election is elected at the convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.071" offset="574562">Brown brought suit under section 401(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="114.339" offset="587728">The case was heard 2 weeks later on a motion for temporary restraining order, and the district court held in favor of respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.279" offset="615418">The court not only held that the focus should be on whether the request was reasonable, but that the rule itself was unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.282" offset="647496">The case then went to the Fourth Circuit, which affirmed, expressly distinguishing precedent from other circuits, and the case came to this Court on petition for writ of certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.312" offset="1451545">--Well, I would say that rationality is one aspect of it, but I would also say that if there is a showing that the rule was adopted solely to impair the rights of candidates to communicate with the membership... now, I suppose that's an aspect of rationality because it goes to the question of what were the reasons for adoption of the rule and the circumstances of the adoption of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.362" offset="1547780">But I would not see any reason for heightened scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.830" offset="1565648">It seems to me that the basic rationality test would be adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.766" offset="1581426">If we begin with the words of the statute, the statute speaks in terms of reasonable requests, and by fashioning that standard the statute imposes a duty upon unions to measure requests to determine whether they are reasonable or unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.728" offset="1653210">In performing that duty, we submit that it is far preferable for the union to have a rule that governs all requests.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.584" offset="1684662">It eliminates any possibility of discrimination, it provides advance notice to all candidates of the conditions under which distribution of literature can be made, and it prevents manipulation of the election procedures by the incumbents in the granting or denial of requests.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.311" offset="1759581">So that in terms of the statute itself, the statute does not preclude the adoption of a reasonable rule, and therefore we must look at the policy underlying the statute to resolve this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.638" offset="1812871">Now, it is certainly true that one of the policies underlying LMRDA was the prevention of abuse by entrenched incumbents, and Congress passed LMRDA in order to further union democracy in the face of evidence that was presented to the McClellan Committee of abuse by entrenched incumbents in a sample of unions that the committee examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.407" offset="1927914">But the fact that that was one of the purposes of the statute does not necessarily say anything about the construction of section 401(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="460.196" offset="1971068">There is nothing peculiar about section 401(c) in terms of incumbents or insurgents.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.584" offset="1992698">In fact, the entire statute, all of LMRDA, was passed for this very reason, that is to prevent abuse by incumbents because of evidence that incumbents had abused their advantages in a number of ways: not holding elections, disenfranchising significant portions of the membership, everything to violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.615" offset="2080783">Nonetheless, the balance of LMRDA, the sections other than 401(c), make repeated reference to union rules and union constitutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.555" offset="2124564">In fact, throughout the statute there are no less than eight references to union constitutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.042" offset="2146507">The statute requires labor organization to adopt constitutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.463" offset="2164165">The statute provides that labor organizations may not impair members rights under the constitutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.017" offset="2186422">The election procedures themselves make repeated reference to union rules that regulate the election procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.270" offset="2211395">One of the ways that Congress intended to combat abuse by entrenched incumbents was by requiring adherence to union constitutions and union rules of procedure, and that is apparent from the structure of the entire act.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.715" offset="2285165">So there is nothing peculiar about section 401(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="542.667" offset="2300943">Section 401(c) is not the only section that affects the rights of insurgents or the power of incumbents to preserve their position in office.</text>

            <text syncTime="1852.311" offset="7539538">And the fact that the union had announced its procedure in advance would be of assistance to the court ultimately in deciding whether the request was reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1929.478" offset="7848201">At the beginning of the hearing the union said we may be able to solve... resolve this case on the record as it is, but if there are factual conflicts we reserve the right to put on evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.619" offset="7888848">The union never disputed that fact, it never disputed the fact that the union, the incumbents had used the union newspaper, not abused it, just used the union newspaper to communicate their views and exclude the views of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.677" offset="7940988">So we don't think that to the extent that the Court finds it necessary to get to the question of whether the rule is reasonable, we don't think that the state of the record is a bar to the Court's deciding the case on the record as it stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.103" offset="8002742">The union also, although Mr. Pierson, I don't know whether he finally answered your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.292" offset="8031476">It certainly attempted to equivocate in answer to Justice O'Connor's question, the union has never argued in this case that the request is unreasonable except insofar as it contradicts a rule which it regards as reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.969" offset="8090200">We think that the language of the statute decides this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.004" offset="8106291">The statute does not require members to comply with, quote, "reasonable union rules".</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.158" offset="8130951">It requires unions to comply with all of a candidate's reasonable requests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.411" offset="8155924">We think this language of the statute could not be clearer, particularly in light of the fact that there are, as Mr. Pierson points out, other parts of the statute which do refer to reasonable union rules and which subject rights to reasonable union rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.505" offset="8216319">Congress chose not to do so here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.940" offset="8226036">The union makes a variety of arguments about why it would be a good idea to focus on the reasonableness of the union's rules, but the fundamental objection to that argument is that that is not what Congress said to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.748" offset="8273266">And what they really want the Court to do is to rewrite the statute in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.069" offset="8290611">Moreover, focusing on the reasonableness of the request rather than on the union's rule is also supported by Congress' purpose in passing this part of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.208" offset="8343169">Congress recognized that union candidates have special problems in communicating with the voters, and it enacted section 401(c) to help candidates overcome those disadvantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.719" offset="8397191">And to understand why it's appropriate to look at the reasonable... inappropriate, excuse me, to look at the reasonableness of the union rule in deciding when the right to do a mailing should be limited, it is important to appreciate the serious communications problem that an insurgent candidate faces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.014" offset="8470334">Unlike a public election, the complete list of voters is secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.732" offset="8489246">Only the union has it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.766" offset="8497396">And unlike a public election, the union leaders, in addition to being in constant contact with the membership in the course of their duties, also control the union newspaper, which they use to communicate their views on union affairs and to trumpet their successes on the members behalf, which they do year in and year out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.348" offset="8583705">Union newspapers do not provide campaign coverage, as the public press does with respect to public elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.937" offset="8614112">And, at least in most unions, a candidate cannot buy advertising space in a camp... in a union publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.940" offset="8642115">Finally, the union members are widely dispersed through the general population.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.363" offset="8667819">Admittedly in this union the problem of dispersion is somewhat extreme, but the problem exists to some extent in every union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.867" offset="8701778">And to reach all the voters by... through the public media, a candidate would have to buy space or time in media which are disseminated to the general public, and particularly in a national election, that would be a prohibitive cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="2174.238" offset="8827271">--As we argued in opposing cert in this case, this case can be disposed of on the ground that it is a patently unreasonable rule, and maybe you should wait for a better case to decide this question of whether you look at the reasonableness of the rule or the reasonableness of the request.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.165" offset="8886934">But the points I am making also go to the question of how you should construe the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.319" offset="8907623">What we're arguing is that because section 401(c) was a remedy for the problem that I have just described, it should be construed in a way which helps to even the playing field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.127" offset="8954853">Adoption of the union's approach, we submit, would make it far more difficult for union members to exercise the right to do campaign mailings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.248" offset="8991320">And there are three reasons why that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.867" offset="9001769">First, the union concedes that its approach establishes a presumption that the union's rule is proper, and it is up to the candidate to establish that the union's rule is unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.242" offset="9055267">So under the union's rule, approach, which they set forth in their reply brief at page 11, some requests which are otherwise reasonable could be denied because the union has a rule which is reasonable in its general application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.502" offset="9108348">The fact that a particular candidate has particular needs could not be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.905" offset="9129978">And so the question is whose interests should receive deference in the close cases, which we submit this is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.427" offset="9164041">In the close cases, whose interests should receive deference?</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.629" offset="9176789">It's close cases where deference makes a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.165" offset="9187029">Should it be the interests of the union leadership in denying a mailing, or should it be the interest of the candidate in having it done?</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.152" offset="9218898">And what we argue is that because it is so clear that this part of the statute was meant to favor challengers by providing them with a vital means for overcoming the advantages of incumbency, and because the market provides a strong incentive for candidates not to make unreasonable requests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.898" offset="9301968">They have to pay for the mailings, so they're less likely to make a request for mailing where they don't really need it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.136" offset="9326836">It is most consistent with the congressional purpose in those circumstances to tip the balance in favor of the challenger, and hold that it is the challenger who has the power to make any request within the range of reasonableness, rather than that the union has the power.</text>

            <text syncTime="2314.681" offset="9389008">Mr. Levy, the Secretary says that she is entitled to deference in interpreting the statute, and yet one of her regulations says that in order to avoid charges of disparity of treatment among candidates, it is advised that a union inform all candidates in advance of the conditions under which distribution will be made, and promptly advise them of any change in those conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.283" offset="9515440">Now, does that, in your view, enable unions to establish a range of conditions that have to be considered in evaluating the reasonableness of a request?</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.543" offset="9572492">Some of them might include the things mentioned by the Chief Justice, for instance, 2 days' notice so we can assemble a list, or, as Justice Scalia suggested, in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.867" offset="9621811">And maybe another could be payment in cash in advance of the mailing of the cost that we determine it will entail.</text>

            <text syncTime="2400.584" offset="9732675">First with respect to how I understand the Secretary's rule and, second, a more general response.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.422" offset="9755976">I understand the Secretary's regulation to say that unions, to the extent that they have established procedure, should provide notice of those procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.843" offset="9793697">But the Secretary does not anticipate fixed, unchanging rules, because the very same regulation says, and if you change the procedures, be sure you send out notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.366" offset="9831836">So it doesn't... the Secretary obviously doesn't anticipate a fixed, unchanging rule, but rather procedures--</text>

            <text syncTime="2433.389" offset="9863914">--The second point... the second point is that, with respect to the kinds of procedures or rules, if you were, that you are describing, those kinds of rules, because they deal with administrative burdens which have to be handled some way in connection with any request, given the statutory, for example, requirement of payment for the mailing, my arguments about adopting a non-deference to the union rule approach because it would disserve the purpose of the statute would not apply to those kinds of rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.518" offset="10040397">But with respect to the rule which says you simply can't, no matter how much notice you give us, do a mailing at a certain amount of time before, more than, say, 10 days before the ballots go out, or the few days which are allowed by the current union rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.928" offset="10098076">With respect to that kind of rule, the argument that I make fully applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.879" offset="10113854">I don't know if I--</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.181" offset="10127019">The second problem with the union's approach is that every time a union member wanted to challenge the denial of a mailing request he would have to show that the union's system with respect to mailing requests as a whole was unreasonable, or he would have to show that the rule had been misapplied, subject, at least according to the union, to the rule that you defer to the incumbent's interpretation of their own constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.201" offset="10243107">Now, especially because the union member has to hire his own lawyer... the union, of course, is defended by union counsel at union expense... it would be very difficult to make that kind of proof in the context of a preliminary injunction hearing, with the election looming, these burdens would make it difficult, in our judgment, for the court to, in Senator Javitz's words, act and act in time, except in the most egregious of cases, which again, I would emphasize we think this is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.905" offset="10365987">So that's another way in which the union's approach, focusing on the reasonableness of the rule, disserves Congress' purpose of helping challengers to make mailing requests when they need them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3272.994" offset="13222320">The argument in the district court in this case, it is clear from a review of the transcript, proceeded solely upon the legal question of how to determine whether a request was reasonable, that is by reference to the rule or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.825" offset="13297658">And in fact, the first thing that the union tried to show at the time of the hearing was that respondent had made other communications with the membership and had other channels of communication, and then the case immediately went off on the discussion of how to construe the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.585" offset="13360665">We therefore submit that if this Court should agree with our position a remand is necessary, and that this Court cannot determine the reasonableness of this rule upon the face of this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.225" offset="13411238">With respect to the test in terms of the statute itself, it seems to me that two things are apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.998" offset="13442272">Number one that, and I do not mean to equivocate in answer to a question, but the argument that there is an intersection between reasonable rules and reasonable requests, and that applying the union's approach will result in the denial of reasonable requests because of the rule, really is not the way that the section intends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.148" offset="13550941">What I mean is this, that it is impossible to determine whether a request is reasonable or unreasonable without looking at the context of the union's election procedure, and therefore it is meaningless to talk about whether a rule is reasonable in the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.360" offset="13615725">And that what the district judge did in this case was meaningless, because he said I find per se that this request is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.347" offset="13647698">Second, it also seems apparent that any rule that can be posited could work a disadvantage to an insurgent candidate, regardless of whether it's a rule that deals with the timing of requests, regardless of whether it's a rule such as in the Provision House case from the Ninth Circuit that says that requests have to be in by a certain date in order to mail literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.212" offset="13739127">Any rule, no matter what the reasons for that rule, may have some impact upon the candidate's ability to conduct a campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.402" offset="13771937">That, however, is not the only factor in determining whether the statute is complied with or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.056" offset="13798582">And the test we propose that looks at the rule first, that permits the candidate to show that it is unreasonable, based upon a variety of factors, effectuates not only the union's reasonable interest in governing its own elections, but also the candidate's interest in that he permits... it permits him to show that somehow there has been abuse or somehow the rule does unfairly impede democracy.</text>
