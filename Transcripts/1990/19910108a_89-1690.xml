            <text syncTime="10.778" offset="173609">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.933" offset="182281">This case is here on the State of California's Petition for Certiorari to the California Court of Appeals, Fourth Appellate District, Division 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.632" offset="221047">California contends that the lower appellate court erred when it ordered the illegal drugs found in the trunk of Mr. Acevedo's car suppressed, because the officers had too much probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.657" offset="273083">That is, they had particularized probable cause as to the paper bag containing the drugs, rather than unparticularized probable cause to the entire vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.561" offset="308714">The State contends that when Mr. Acevedo voluntarily and intentionally placed the bag into the trunk of the car, it attained the same degree of mobility as the car, and by being in the car, it was subject to the lesser expectation of privacy that surrounds a vehicle and its contents.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.926" offset="398262">What I'd like to do this morning is briefly go through the facts with you, and then explain why we believe this Court's decisions in Carroll, Ross, and Carney should be held to control in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.140" offset="447059">We believe this Court should rule that the decisions in Chadwick and Sanders have been limited by the subsequent decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.247" offset="475480">The facts are not in any dispute in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.230" offset="491467">Back in 1987 Federal drug agents in Hawaii intercepted a shipment of drugs bound for the mainland, nine bags... nine kilo bags of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.117" offset="526993">They contacted the Santa Ana police department, allowed the drugs to proceed to the Federal Express office, and the local police officers arranged a controlled delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.660" offset="565132">They followed the drugs back to Mr. Daza's apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.423" offset="580179">After a few minutes Mr. Daza came out and threw away the outer wrapping material and the inner wrapping material, so it was clear to the officers that he was manipulating the contents, the drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.779" offset="621661">And at that point they did what we want officers to do under those circumstances, they went to get a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.073" offset="642768">While the officer was gone... one of the officers was gone getting the search warrant, co-defendant St. Gregory exited, I'm sorry, St. George exited with a knapsack.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.163" offset="687176">The officer stopped him and discovered a pound and half of marijuana in his knapsack.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.209" offset="703372">Shortly thereafter Mr. Acevedo arrived, carrying nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.284" offset="719672">He entered the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.909" offset="726151">About 10 minutes later he came out carrying a bag, a paper bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.968" offset="746422">The bag appeared to be... the bag appeared to be full.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.124" offset="758961">He got in... he walked to his vehicle, placed it in the trunk of his vehicle, and drove off.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.715" offset="781321">The officers had a... had a marked car stop him nearby.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.121" offset="798980">The trunk was opened, the bag was opened, and they found approximately a pound, I'm sorry, a half a pound of marijuana.</text>

            <text syncTime="202.871" offset="942027">I believe either as a... as a search incident to the arrest... and as we point out in the brief, Your Honor, I think there's another way that it could have been searched, which is once he placed it into the vehicle, voluntarily and intentionally taking advantage of the mobility of the car, when he takes advantage of that aspect of the vehicle he has to take at the same time the limitations that come with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.394" offset="1024051">The limitations that come with it, this Court has clearly marked in Ross, Carroll, and Carney, which is a lesser expectation of privacy, because of the mobility of the vehicle.</text>

            <text syncTime="237.514" offset="1080580">That's a little bit of a weak argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.967" offset="1086327">When you put something in the trunk of a car you don't really expect the world to be looking in and seeing what's there, do you?</text>

            <text syncTime="259.380" offset="1168038">I am sure when Mr. Ross in that case placed the bag of drugs and the pouch of money into the trunk he had the same subjective expectation as Mr. Acevedo.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.689" offset="1205237">In that sense the cases are very parallel, because both Mr. Ross and Mr. Acevedo placed bags of drugs into the trunk of their vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.059" offset="1242748">And in Ross this Court held that that subjective expectation of privacy was not objectively reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="287.665" offset="1281201">I think the point is that he... that it was a voluntary and intentional act in his part in putting the bag into the vehicle.</text>

            <text syncTime="351.904" offset="1538141">And I don't think that's an accurate analysis, with all due respect to the Chief Justice, because it perceives the relationship as a fortuity, and it was not a fortuity.</text>

            <text syncTime="452.831" offset="1941785">And I think that the... as we spoke in that discussion, the underpinnings of Chadwick and Sanders have been eaten away by this Court's subsequent decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.842" offset="1993926">As we talked about in answering your question, Chadwick and Sanders look at the search of the bag, or the search of the closed container at the point of the actual search, whereas this Court made it clear in Ross that you look at it, the mobility, at the moment of seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.428" offset="2064247">Because if you look at it the other way the Ross holding would not stand, Your Honor, because as you well recall, they searched the bag in the field, found it, took it to the police station and then opened it again without a warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1252.884" offset="5141994">The California court of appeal ruled there is, and I think the facts abundantly show there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.037" offset="5158608">I mean, they knew for a fact there was marijuana in the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.894" offset="5174072">When Mr. St. George came out he was carrying part of the marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.472" offset="5188388">It was clear that Mr. Daza was manipulating the marijuana because he had thrown away the inner and outer wrappings of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.657" offset="5213152">And then Mr. Acevedo goes in carrying nothing and comes out carrying a paper bag that appears to be full.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.779" offset="5233632">It seems to me that the reasonable conclusion to draw from that is they are breaking up the load of marijuana, and it's starting to be distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.059" offset="5262784">I think there's abundant probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.042" offset="5270726">And I think given that, then the question becomes what conduct we want from the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.759" offset="5297579">And it's clear these officers were trying to comply with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.304" offset="5307715">They had left to get the search warrant at the time for the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.959" offset="5322343">It was only the fortuity of Mr. Acevedo showing up at 10 minutes after 12 as opposed to 40 minutes after 12 that brought this situation about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.252" offset="5355467">You know, the Fourth Amendment talks about reasonable conduct on the part of the officers, and I think it was under these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.718" offset="5377410">They were trying to get the warrant at the time Mr. Acevedo appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.623" offset="5392979">The problem, of course, remains, and this Court had talked about it in Ross, about the convenience factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.230" offset="5415444">That what do you do with the vehicle, and what do you do with the individual if we're going to require a warrant for the container?</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.586" offset="5444806">Well, if the container... if you have probable cause to believe that the container contains drugs, you have then suspicion that the individual has been possessing and/or transporting drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.128" offset="5495065">You are still going to end up then, if you require a warrant, holding the defendant and the passengers and holding the vehicle until you have obtained the warrant and learned what is inside of the bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.717" offset="5537383">So you don't gain anything in terms of the convenience that this Court was concerned with in Ross.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.888" offset="5554102">If you give... the analogy might be to the Payton case that this Court talked about, that when Mr.... you need a search warrant, you need an arrest warrant or a search warrant to arrest an individual in his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.085" offset="5610840">Where that individual goes outside of the home and goes elsewhere, you don't need the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.616" offset="5629021">I think that's the same situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.770" offset="5633619">Where the individual has a closed container, you would need a warrant to search that closed container.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.861" offset="5657965">But when he coluntarily and intentionally places it into the vehicle, he places it in there to a different zone, a zone of mobility, a zone of a lesser expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.686" offset="5701223">And given that rapid mobility on the part of the vehicle, you should be able to search it without a warrant, since there is probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.026" offset="5734660">The question remains under those circumstances what Fourth Amendment value is served by requiring a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.085" offset="5774889">As this Court talked about in Carroll, the first United States Congress, the Congress that wrote the Fourth Amendment and sent the document out for ratification by the States, made a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.829" offset="5821805">And in dealing with the search of effects in an individual's home, in the home you needed a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.184" offset="5855241">But they... that came out of the problem with the Writs of Assistance under the British.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.731" offset="5865481">But the... one of the very first bills they passed was a customs and tonnage revenue raising document, and in that they allowed for searches in homes only with the warrant, but they allowed for warrantless searches based on probable cause of vessels and vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.989" offset="5938415">The point being that the search of effects outside of the home in a movable vehicle has always been treated differently, even by those founding fathers who wrote the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.595" offset="5984913">Unless the Court has any further questions, I'd like to reserve the remaining time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1530.349" offset="6251885">If there is probable cause to search a vehicle, you can search and seize everything in it, including the containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.128" offset="6279052">This is the search of a package not incident to an arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2605.149" offset="10551117">Acevedo's bag containing marijuana weighed between a quarter and a half pound.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.850" offset="10565955">The Attorney General alludes to a footnote... in his first footnote to the reply brief, but there is nothing in the record to support that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.393" offset="10600123">Now, the other problem with probable cause is that the Attorney General points out that you have to look at the totality of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.421" offset="10640143">I don't argue with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.389" offset="10644113">However, in his totality you have the police officer that stops Acevedo and searches his vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.715" offset="10669400">He assumes that he knows about St. George, and that's not in the record either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.384" offset="10687999">We have no information in the record that the officer that searched Acevedo's bag knew anything about the results of the search of St. George.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.272" offset="10723630">In fact we have no information in the record which even indicates that the officer that searched Acevedo's bag knew anything about St. George even leaving the apartment, let alone what was in St. George's knapsack.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.688" offset="10777233">So the record is really deficient, and my example in the brief I believe sets forth the facts as they are on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.105" offset="10814954">And that is that you have an individual who walks into a house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.166" offset="10827179">I will concede that there is... that there's no question that we know that there is marijuana in the, in the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.665" offset="10857168">He walks in there empty-handed, he walks out 10 minutes later with a brown paper bag that appears to be full.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.459" offset="10880365">The officer described it as similar to a lunch bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.646" offset="10889142">And on the basis of that, I would think that it's deficient in probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.409" offset="10912130">I think that there may be a suspicion, as in Place, and the officer could have stopped and run some kind of a cursory Terry-type situation investigation, but nothing more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.921" offset="10958210">There's been a lot of talk about mobility of the vehicle, but again, if you view this as the search of a package and not the search of a vehicle, then you don't even need to get into the mobility of the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.445" offset="11024247">Furthermore, Justice O'Connor mentioned couldn't he be searched as incident to arrest?</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.786" offset="11061655">Yes, he could, but he wasn't in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.487" offset="11068446">He wasn't placed under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.800" offset="11073671">He wasn't searched incident to the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.783" offset="11081612">However, a search incident to an arrest when he was in the vehicle would not cover what was in the trunk, because under Belton you can search what's in the car, but you can't get into the trunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.921" offset="11122154">Now, the other thing as to an inventory search, yes, if they had arrested him, hauled his car in, and searched it on an inventory search, yes, they could have gotten there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.745" offset="11157472">But again, they didn't do it in this case, nor did they arrest him for transportation of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.914" offset="11182131">In summary, I urge this Court to affirm the lower court's decision on either of two bases: that there was no probable cause for any type of search, or secondly, that this is the search of a package and not the search of a vehicle.</text>
