            <text syncTime="784.013" offset="3260383">In this case, clearly demand was futile.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.165" offset="3276893">And I would submit that the arguments that even where it is futile some good may nevertheless come out of making a demand is not really an appropriate consideration for courts to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.589" offset="3362679">For example, in the Fox case which is oft cited in the briefs, the Court came to the conclusion that demand would be futile because under the statute the corporation was disabled from bringing the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.792" offset="3443449">And that's a little bit different from what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.716" offset="3459123">But in that case the petitioner argued that even though the corporation could not bring the claim... it also involved a mutual fund... demand would serve many useful intra-corporate purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.566" offset="3526519">It would cause the directors to focus on the contract with the investment advisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.519" offset="3550342">They might revise the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="867.669" offset="3594960">That's always true, but I submit that the purpose of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are, while undoubtedly having some effect on corporate governments, are really directed toward corporate litigation and not with the operation of corporate law internally.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.953" offset="3688060">And therefore I don't subscribe, obviously, to the Seventh Circuit's views on this matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="924.334" offset="3821598">Our view is that State law should apply to the case, in this case Maryland law, unless that State law is so inconsistent with the enforcement of the important Federal public policies underlying the proxy rules, in this case section 20 of the Investment Company Act, that to insist upon the enforcement of the rule and impose burdens upon plaintiffs seeking to enforce that public policy would thwart the public policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1126.236" offset="4629200">Well, there are two responses I'd like to give to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.979" offset="4644246">First of all, the question of whether demand is required or not is a Federal question because the cause of action arises under a Federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.805" offset="4687505">There is no doubt about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.867" offset="4691789">The next issue is from what source does Federal law derive the rule of decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.351" offset="4713732">This Court has in many contexts held that even when a question is governed by Federal law, Federal law may turn to State law rather than fashioning an entire body of law on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.576" offset="4758558">I think the Kimbell Foods case is the outstanding example of this, and the Court applied a very similar principle in Burks v. Lasker when it comes to the law of corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.035" offset="4800458">Corporations, after all, are created under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.946" offset="4816027">When Congress regulated in the Investment Company Act, as it did in the other securities acts to regulate corporate activities, it did not provide for Federal chartering of corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.336" offset="4861585">It relied on States to charter corporations and to basically regulate the activities of corporations subject only to the predominant Federal policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.840" offset="4899619">So Federal law displaces State law to the extent it is necessary to achieve Federal goals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1215.835" offset="4987600">That question, of course, isn't here today, since we don't have a State that provided for universal demand, although there are several.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.002" offset="5016334">I think that the real way to answer whether it conforms to Federal policy is to look at what happens after demand is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.616" offset="5046741">Does that... does the making of demand in a particular State give the corporation a leg-up in dismissing the derivative action?</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.539" offset="5078401">If it does and the corporation is invested with too much power to cut off a Federal claim, there may very well be a conflict with Federal policy.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="1259.624" offset="5162724">Well, the Seventh Circuit thought it could achieve a nice distinction, a very logical, tidy distinction between a Federal rule of universal demand and State law governing what happens after demand is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.621" offset="5218731">The problem with that approach is, although it sounds nice in theory, in fact it doesn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.177" offset="5244958">The reason it doesn't work is because many States place an integral connection between whether a shareholder has to make demand and what standard of review is subsequently applied to the board of directors' decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.024" offset="5292396">So Delaware, for example, which is a leading State in corporate law, says that if a demand is required of the shareholder and not excused, then the directors' subsequent decision not to sue is judged very deferentially under the business judgment rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.586" offset="5354672">On the other hand, if demand is futile because the board is either biased or too implicated in the transaction to act on it, then a much higher standard of review applies when the corporation attempts to terminate the suit.</text>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="1321.423" offset="5409947">Mr. Dreeben, I understood the Seventh Circuit to avoid that problem by federalizing the latter question as well, that is by saying how much deference you give to the board decision is also a Federal question, and we will not adopt as a matter of Federal law the business judgment rule.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="1337.335" offset="5473582">Well, I am not sure that the court said exactly either of those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.747" offset="5491240">If it said... if it thought it was saying that it's a Federal question what standard of review applies to the board of directors' decision, then in effect it overruled Burks v. Lasker, because Burks v. Lasker held that the power of corporate directors to terminate a derivative action, even based on a Federal statute, derives in the first instance from State law unless it conflicts with Federal policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.220" offset="5573160">So there's a two-pronged inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.872" offset="5579743">I don't think that the court of appeals actually intended that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.213" offset="5589147">I think what the court of appeals thought is that we can have a Federal rule, which it thought was procedural, of universal demand followed by the application of State law as it's found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.361" offset="5629689">But the real difficulty with that proposition, I think, is that State law simply does not draw the distinction between demand and the standard of review in every instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.416" offset="5669918">In some cases, in many, it ties them together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.739" offset="5683188">And once a shareholder makes a demand under Delaware law, the business judgment rule applies in every single case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.724" offset="5711191">So under the Seventh Circuit's Federal universal demand rule you have two options.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.386" offset="5729791">One option would be to say since the shareholder made a demand we now apply the Delaware standard of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.109" offset="5752674">It's the business judgment rule, in every single case, even though Delaware might have applied a different standard because demand was actually futile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.596" offset="5782662">The other alternative... that alternative I think is not only conceptually incorrect, it overrides State policy needlessly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.190" offset="5813069">The other alternative would be for the court to engage in a hypothetical inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.923" offset="5828011">Would Delaware have excused demand in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.145" offset="5840863">If we answer that question we'll then know what standard of review Delaware wanted to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.738" offset="5859253">But if you engage in that inquiry you're right back where you started.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.160" offset="5872942">You're litigating demand futility, and the court of appeals rule serves no purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.471" offset="5890182">The basic reason why the court of appeals got off on the wrong foot, I think, is it evaluated the demand question as one of Federal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.378" offset="5921843">It's really not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.577" offset="5926545">It's really a rule that governs substantive law of corporate internal affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.541" offset="5942427">A corporation may have a claim that can be asserted in court, but it is an artificial entity, and the question in a derivative action is who has the right to speak for a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.798" offset="5987462">Normally it's the board of directors under State law, but State law almost universally recognizes an exception for derivative actions where the directors have wrongfully refused to protect corporate claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.835" offset="6035632">In that instance shareholders may step in and speak for the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.808" offset="6055485">The demand rule stands as a threshold requirement that helps to regulate when shareholders can do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.373" offset="6081817">The demand rule says that before shareholders may take the extraordinary step of usurping the board of directors' prerogatives, they have to make a demand on the directors to see whether the directors want to take over the suit or how they will react to it, to give them a chance to make a corporate judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.804" offset="6143466">State law, however, recognizes that in some instances it would only obstruct the protection of shareholder rights, who are, after all, the owners of the corporation, to have to go to the very board of directors that may be implicated in the transaction--</text>

            <text syncTime="1535.134" offset="6264778">But the way that many States regulate derivative actions is that if demand is excused the courts take a more active role in regulating the directors' efforts to cut it off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.151" offset="6308873">If demand is required, then the directors have a greater power.</text>

            <text syncTime="1617.698" offset="6595071">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.314" offset="6637493">The district court correctly dismissed the proxy claim in this case, and the court of appeals correctly affirmed that dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.500" offset="6666228">We respectfully submit that regardless of whether this Court chooses to apply Federal law or State law, and regardless of whether the futility exception is applied or the futility exception is abolished, this Court should affirm the dismissal of the proxy claim in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.331" offset="6737595">I would like to make three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.792" offset="6747417">First, both courts below correctly concluded that the allegations of futility in the complaint in this case were totally inadequate to excuse the making of a demand upon the directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.441" offset="6802065">Second, both courts below correctly concluded that Federal law should apply in dealing with the demand issue on this Federal cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.847" offset="6847622">And third, the court of appeals correctly held that under Federal law the futility exception to the demand requirement should be eliminated in order to promote important policies underlying the demand requirement, including judicial economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.471" offset="6918153">Turning first to the insufficiency of the allegations, the district court found that if you disregard the conclusory allegations in petitioner's complaint only two factual allegations of futility remain, that the directors receive fees for serving as directors, and the directors voted to send out the challenged proxy material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.065" offset="7008537">Petitioner cites no case, State or Federal, in which boilerplate allegations of futility such as these have been held to excuse demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.461" offset="7050124">The Federal law as to facts which would be sufficient to excuse the making of a demand is well stated in the Kauffman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.218" offset="7089203">In Kauffman the First Circuit said that demand could be excused only upon a particularized showing that the directors are so antagonistic to the interests of the corporation that they could not discharge their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.579" offset="7150643">In our case the directors are not named as defendants, nor are they alleged to have engaged in any wrongdoing whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.804" offset="7187528">This is particularly significant because full discovery on the merits was available to petitioner in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2619.926" offset="10604031">The virtue of a uniform Federal law of demand is particularly evident under the Federal policy that is reflected in the independent director provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940.</text>

            <text syncTime="2649.047" offset="10720432">Applying a uniform Federal law of demand will help ensure that the demand rules do not evolve in such a way as to usurp the watch dog role of the independent directors under the Investment Company Act of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.427" offset="10790022">As my third argument, Your Honors, I submit that this judgment can be approved on the separate ground that the court of appeals correctly held that the futility exception to the demand requirement should be abolished.</text>

            <text syncTime="3198.164" offset="12916912">Your Honor, we respectfully request that the dismissal of the proxy claim in this case be affirmed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard M. Meyer</label>
            <text syncTime="3210.133" offset="12964769">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.425" offset="12977934">I will be very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.405" offset="12985875">Hopefully I won't need to use the 3 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.627" offset="12994757">At the risk of helping my opponent, I believe Ms. Hall intended to have reference to page 17A of the appendix with respect to the discussion of futility, the last paragraph on that page.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.606" offset="13062675">I won't take time to read it, but I think if Your Honors read it you will see that the court below says both things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.243" offset="13101232">And it's pretty clear that it can't make up its mind whether the allegations are sufficient to establish futility or not, and therefore adopts a rule saying whether or not futile we must insist on demand in all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.285" offset="13173435">I should have referred before to the Borak case as a case which insists on applying the Federal standards no matter... to proxy fraud case no matter what State law would apply, and I submit that on that reasoning, which was adopted in Galef subsequent to the Burks decision, Burks is clearly distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.086" offset="13300599">Burks was that unusual type of derivative action that really was a business judgment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.941" offset="13324004">There was no self-dealing involved in Burks at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.283" offset="13341454">That was a question of whether management made a business judgment mistake in purchasing Penn Central Commercial Paper from Goldman Sachs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.449" offset="13382101">And in fact prior to the decision, I think, management had instituted an action against Goldman Sachs and effected a recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.754" offset="13415329">The only other point I might make is that on this question of waiver of State law, the State law question was never really waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.461" offset="13454094">It was never really raised by either party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.715" offset="13471126">We said in our initial complaint, we hadn't really made any demand allegations except with respect to 36B.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.741" offset="13515221">On the motion to dismiss, we amended the complaint, added the demand allegations, and addressed the argument of the defendants by saying we now have allegations in the complaint that excuse demand, that it's not merely a question, as you know from having read the papers, of the fact that they got paid for being directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.985" offset="13604246">That would be simplistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.217" offset="13609157">Basically those are the points that I wanted to raise on rebuttal, and unless the Court has questions I thank you very much.</text>
