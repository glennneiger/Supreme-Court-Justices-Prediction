            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73977">The opinion of the Court in No. 89-680, James Beam Distilling Company against Georgia will be announced by Justice Souter.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="10.686" offset="116713">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.655" offset="136566">Before 1985, Georgia law imposed an excise tax on imported liquor at double the rate it imposed on liquor manufactured from Gerogia-grown products.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.659" offset="180557">In 1984, this Court in Bacchus Imports Limited against Dias held that a similar Hawaii law violated the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.492" offset="219845">Petitioner, Manufacturer and Distributor of Kentucky Bourbon, thereafter, filed an action in the Georgia State Court seeking a refund of taxes it had paid under Georgia's law for the years 1982, '83, and '84.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.464" offset="283793">On the basis of our decision in Bacchus, the court declared the statute unconstitutional but refused to apply its ruling on a retroactive basis and thus, denied petitioner's request for a refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.230" offset="330813">The State Supreme Court affirmed and the petitioners sought review by this Court on the retroactivity question.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.507" offset="355995">The judgment is reversed and the case remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.573" offset="368220">In an opinion filed today with the Clerk of the Court in which Justice Stevens joins, I conclude that because Bacchus applied its own rule retroactively to the litigants there before the court, the rule must also be so applied to the parties in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.872" offset="429451">I believe this result to be demanded by principles of equality and stare decisis which do not allow this court to apply new rules of law on a selective basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.232" offset="470829">Justice White has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment; Justice Blackmun has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justice Marshall and Justice Scalia join; Justice Scalia has also filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justice Marshall and Justice Blackmun join. Justice O'Connor has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy join.</text>
