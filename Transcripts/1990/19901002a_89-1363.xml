            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="12.391" offset="181683">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.176" offset="192759">The issue in this case is whether a defendant may challenge the assignment of jury selection in a criminal case to a magistrate when the defendant has not objected to that procedure in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.733" offset="243019">Now, this case comes to the Court on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the NInth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.571" offset="270395">The case was tried in the district of Hawaii, which at the time had a practice and a local rule of permitting the magistrate to conduct jury selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.481" offset="322013">This was done in a number of districts around the country, and was terminated abruptly, of course, with this Court's decision in the Gomez case 2 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.385" offset="353673">This case raises the question, of course, what to do with the many cases that were either on direct review or have come up on collateral attack following the Gomez decision, where a magistrate did select a jury, and where there was, in the case of direct review cases, no objection to the use of the magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.183" offset="444788">The condition was for assault and firearms charges, and an appeal was taken in which the issue of the magistrate's jury selection was not raised in the court of appeals initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.676" offset="498810">The case was pending in the court of appeals when this Court decided the Gomez case, and the respondent promptly requested reversal on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.366" offset="533605">The court of appeals did in fact reverse on that ground in response to the Government's principal submission, which was that there had been no objection, and therefore reversal was inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.887" offset="575610">The court of appeals said that the so-called Futility Doctrine applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.475" offset="602046">That is to say that because the court of appeals for the Ninth Circuit had previously upheld jury selection by magistrates on both statutory and constitutional grounds, that it would have been futile for the defendant to object to jury selection by the magistrate, and therefore the requirements of rules 51 and 52 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure were waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.859" offset="699535">That is to say there was no obligation for the defendant to raise this point in the district court, and there was no forfeiture of the right as a consequence of the failure to raise these points.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.714" offset="743002">The respondent here has made a number of different arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.952" offset="763900">The futility point was the only one addressed by the court of appeals, but we have addressed and will address here each of the various arguments that respondent has raised in support of the judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.414" offset="829729">Turning first to the futility argument, it's useful I think first to start with the simple language of rules 51 and 52, and as I'll concede, the language of the rules does not contain any reference to any futility exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.689" offset="898901">The only exception in rule 52 is an exception for plain error, and that is generally understood to be error which was quite obvious and led to a miscarriage of justice, undermined the confidence in the verdict, undermined the confidence in the integrity of judicial proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="236.737" offset="1079042">I think in some cases it could, Your Honor, and let me suggest that I think there is a difference because that depends entirely on who that person was.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.474" offset="1109971">In our... our submission is that when that person is, as was the case in this case, a judicial officer who is completely under the control of the court, is somebody who is hired an fired by the court, and who is performing a task which is subject to the review of the court, that if there is an article III violation it is not one which is so grave that you would say that the entire proceeding has to be negated, that this constitute plain error.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.049" offset="1272348">The fact that... it is accepted, of course, that Congress didn't authorize this procedure to be followed, but that does not necessarily mean that that right, and it is a right, we submit, to have a judge conduct jury selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.506" offset="1326160">But our solution is that that is a right which can be waived unless it constitutes plain error.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.326" offset="1349357">And again, we submit that this doesn't constitute plain error.</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="307.980" offset="1363985">Well, the question then becomes whether it is plain error under these circumstances, when it is not an article III judge and Congress has not authorized it.</text>

            <text syncTime="317.553" offset="1402333">We submit and have discussed in our brief the reasons that we feel that that is a waivable defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.859" offset="1435561">It is a forfeitable defect, and it has been forfeited.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.359" offset="1445487">The... there are many rights, statutory, constitutional rights even, that can be forfeited or waived, as this Court has held time and again, that don't constitute plain error even though they may, of course, be cognizable if objected to.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.170" offset="1516749">Indeed there are some instances... I would pick for example discrimination in the selection of a grand jury... in which the Court has held that these errors may not be deemed harmless, yet the Court has further said that if not objected to in a timely basis they may be forfeited or waived under rule 51.</text>

            <text syncTime="605.262" offset="2553184">"the futility of presenting an objection to the State courts cannot alone constitute cause for failure to object at trial. "</text>
            <text syncTime="611.768" offset="2579202">Again, where the basis of a constitutional claim is available, and other defense counsel have perceived and litigated that claim, it does not constitute cause for failure to object at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.342" offset="2633432">Now, respondent claims that although those cases can be distinguished, that case and the... Murray against Carrier case which followed it, can be distinguished on the grounds that those are habeas corpus cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.133" offset="2680661">But we don't think that that distinction holds water, because the whole cause and prejudice doctrine originated in a Federal case, and originated as an application of a Federal waiver rule, rule 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.625" offset="2730607">It is clear that the rule with respect to cause is at least as strict in the Federal system as it is under the language with respect to futility that I have just read.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.599" offset="2778464">Indeed, rule 12 does contain, after all, an exception for cause, while rule 51 and rule 52 do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.288" offset="2809288">So, if anything, there is less room for the futility doctrine in this setting than in the setting of habeas corpus cases where the Court has applied the... the cause and prejudice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1005.085" offset="4152400">With respect to the futility doctrine, if I can address not just the language of the rule in the cases, but the policies underlying such a doctrine, I think it would be quite mischievous to have a doctrine that allowed counsel to avoid the obligation of raising a particular point just because counsel felt, whether reasonably or not, that the immediately... the appellate court to which the conviction would be taken would be not likely to accept such a claim with open arms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.240" offset="4285102">First of all, the whole doctrine of futility is based in a sense on a false premise, which is that it would be futile, and these cases only come up where it turns out not to have been futile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.329" offset="4321464">If this case had come up with an objection there would be no problem; we wouldn't be here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1055.018" offset="4352184">Furthermore, it just invites the kind of messy factual determination that makes the application of the contemporaneous objection rule extremely cumbersome if you have to go back and decide whether the degree of foreclosure, if you will, by the court of appeals or by the courts generally was sufficiently... sufficiently grave that you can regard the question as futile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.120" offset="4480602">The kinds of cases will produce questions of that sort in time and time again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.774" offset="4499202">And again, if I can refer to the Akins case, which is cited by respondent, that is a perfect example of the problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.797" offset="4531280">In this case, for example, it is true that the Ninth Circuit had said twice before that there was no constitutional or statutory violation by virtue of jury selection by magistrates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.355" offset="4577569">But at the time of this trial the Fifth Circuit had granted rehearing en banc, to consider en banc that question, and one could have anticipated for that... from that without a great deal of [inaudible] that it was likely that the Fifth Circuit would go the other way and that it might well produce a case before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1175.395" offset="4833673">--Exactly, and that is our next point, which is that there was absolutely nothing in the Ninth Circuit cases that foreclosed the judge from picking a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.784" offset="4867215">This was merely, as respondent says, it was a practice that was employed in the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.771" offset="4891143">But I would point out, however, that this particular judge was a visiting judge, and that there were occasions on which visiting judges, and there were a number of them in Hawaii during this period, there were occasions in which visiting judges would pick a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.496" offset="4938059">In fact in the Akins case the visiting judge offered to pick a jury when an objection was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.113" offset="4960524">So it's by no means clear that the district judge would not have agreed either simply to dispose of this question as a possible appellate issue or, because the visiting judge felt more comfortable picking juries, that the visiting judge would have done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.373" offset="5017575">Indeed, the Peacock case invited courts, in spite of the fact that there was no violation, invited courts to pick a jury, and pointed out that there were many good reason that a court might want to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.015" offset="5060207">But in any event, the problem of trying to get into these kinds of hearings, deciding on a case-by-case basis of whether this objection would have been futile or not, as this case well illustrates, would be, would render the rule so cumbersome that it would almost not be worth having, at least with respect to this class of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.963" offset="5155920">Now, the next point that I would like to address I have adverted to already, and that is this, the question of whether there is an absence of jurisdiction here, in the jurisdictional sense that the Court uses the term sometimes, that would deprive the... that would be either automatic reversal or would deprive the district court of jurisdiction to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.548" offset="5266261">The article III issue, as we submit, is essentially controlled by the Radats case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.755" offset="5307117">Now, it is true that this Court in Gomez held that the statute didn't permit jury selection, but of course it didn't address the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.931" offset="5367825">In our view, if you take the factors that the Radats case found to solve the article III problem, those factors are largely present here, and in some respects this case is an easier case than Radats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.156" offset="5420697">Radats, you will recall, was a case in which, as all agreed, the entire case turned on the outcome of the suppression hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.844" offset="5447446">It was either up or down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.128" offset="5452566">If the suppression hearing was decided against the defendant, that was the end of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.896" offset="5467717">If it was decided in favor of the defendant, that was the end of the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.534" offset="5482242">In this case we submit that jury selection, whatever importance it may have, and we concede that it has real importance in the system, it can't be said to be the whole case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.823" offset="5527381">And in particular in this case, where there was no controversy surrounding this jury selection, there were no challenges for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.179" offset="5560818">It was a very smooth jury selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.698" offset="5570849">There were no objections made by the defendant at the end when he was... when she was invited to object to any of the procedures in the jury selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.236" offset="5605017">It is very hard to say that this was a process that... in which the magistrate as a rogue had gone off on his own and done something which really rendered the district court's control over the process to be negatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.681" offset="5670846">In this case the magistrate acted under the supervision of the district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.050" offset="5688295">The district judge was available all during the objections to answer the objections, and if there were a serious objection to the way the whole process had been conducted, the district court, of course, could have simply done it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.775" offset="5735211">Now, we recognize, and the Court in Gomez pointed out that there are real problems with trying to redo or fix these kinds of procedures when they are done by a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.248" offset="5785053">It's inherent in the process of delegating another person to do a task that the judge otherwise would perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.788" offset="5819221">But that would be the same situation that was present in Radats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.740" offset="5831028">In Radats the problem was a suppression hearing, and that suppression hearing was conducted entirely by the magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.977" offset="5864047">The Court held that article III was satisfied by the degree of supervision that the district court had over the magistrate in general, in hiring, firing, and supervising its conduct, as well as the availability at least to some extent, of correcting error.</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Bryson</label>
            <text syncTime="3224.331" offset="13029435">Very briefly, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.981" offset="13036018">First it's I think important to focus on the breadth of the claim here with respect to article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.854" offset="13063499">The contention is that even with consent article III bars trials in which a magistrate plays any material role.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.310" offset="13109370">That would, I take it, take care of, throw out all misdemeanor trials which are triable by magistrates under the statute, and probably as well all civil trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.736" offset="13163077">There are a lot of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.870" offset="13167571">I think you have to understand the degree of the disruption to the system, as well as the degree to which you would be holding the Magistrate's Act unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.741" offset="13199022">Because there is nothing in article III, as far as I can tell, that distinguishes between felonies and misdemeanors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.527" offset="13214173">You can have a felony which results in a smaller sentence than a misdemeanor, which is up to a year's term in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.681" offset="13238833">Second, the contention is made that Darlina France had the right to an article III judge and she didn't get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.203" offset="13264955">Well, she did have that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.503" offset="13270075">She just didn't ask for it, and that's the whole point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.989" offset="13280106">She had the right to have a judge conduct the jury selection, and she might well have gotten that opportunity had she asked for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.845" offset="13319499">She didn't ask for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.345" offset="13321484">As to the suggestion that it was because the jury was selected on a Monday, she should have gone in the previous Friday and said, judge, I move for jury selection by a judge and not by the magistrate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3320.126" offset="13412599">And if the judge had not acted on them, counsel should have stood up at the time the jury selection began and said my motion has not been acted on, please postpone the proceedings until it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.732" offset="13447081">As to the question of waiver of... the question of the novelty exception, we do not concede that the novelty exception applies in the rule 51-52 context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.693" offset="13518865">Those cases in which the novelty exception has been recognized have been either cases in which this Court has addressed questions that were subjects to, as the Court perceived them, a Johnson against Zerbst waiver, or habeas corpus cases such as Reed v. Ross, in which the Court was applying a cause and prejudice standard and construing cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.726" offset="13611025">There is, as we pointed out earlier, no cause exception in rule 51-52.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.345" offset="13629520">However, we don't need to go that far.</text>

            <text syncTime="3378.699" offset="13646865">In Engle against Isaac and in Reed against Ross the Court made very clear the distinction between a novelty exception and a futility exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.903" offset="13675704">It said that yes, novelty is... is something that constitutes cause for the failure to raise an issue below because novelty comes up in a case where there simply... the lawyer simply did not have the means to make the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.197" offset="13736935">And went on to say that if the argument was one that others were making at the time, this is one that should have been made, it doesn't constitute novelty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.268" offset="13769223">That is this case.</text>
