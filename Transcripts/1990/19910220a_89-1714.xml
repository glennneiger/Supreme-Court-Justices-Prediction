            <text syncTime="19.837" offset="204985">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="22.882" offset="217106">The Black Lung Benefits Act provides a workers' compensation-type benefit to coal miners and their families on account of total disability or death due to black lung disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.252" offset="262663">The statute has no other purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.782" offset="268724">In the cases before the court, the fact finders have determined that Mr. Dayton and Mr. Taylor do not have black lung disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.920" offset="309266">Mr. Pauley had an early stage of the disease, but it was determined in his case that he had no disability or impairment due to this disease at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.102" offset="353987">Dayton, Taylor, and Pauley nevertheless believe that they are entitled to be compensated for totally disabling black lung disease, even though they do not have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.269" offset="398709">The reason that they give is that a fair factual inquiry in to the truth of the matters in their cases is, they say, prohibited by Section 402(f)(2) of the Black Lung Benefits Act, which they say required the Department of Labor to write eligibility regulations that irrebuttably presumed their entitlement to benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.618" offset="500064">The Department of Labor wrote extremely liberal regulations that presumed all of the hard parts of their cases, the hard factual parts, in favor of the claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.161" offset="542278">But those presumptions are not irrebuttable.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.676" offset="552309">The questions that have been presented here this morning are, first, whether Section 402(f)(2) of the Black Lung Act required the Department of Labor to enact such irrebuttable presumptions, and secondly, if that... if it did, whether Section 402(f)(2) is constitutionally viable to the extent that it irrebuttably and retroactively imposes upon these mine operators the obligation to pay for harm that either they did not cause or that does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.570" offset="675920">We do not believe that it is necessary to reach the due process questions presented because Section 402(f)(2) does not prohibit factual inquiry into the truth in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.674" offset="724299">We think that a fair reading of the act in its context leads to several key conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.171" offset="754288">First of all, the irrebuttability theory that is presented to you today is solely and exclusively a product of this Court's decision in Pittston Coal Group.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.839" offset="797024">It has never before been suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.587" offset="804025">If these cases that are here before you today had almost 20 years ago been presented to the Social Security Administration based upon the records that are here, I am confident that they would have been denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.941" offset="865360">The claims processors working for that agency would not have ignored the relevant and persuasive evidence that these people did not have pneumoconiosis or any related disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.325" offset="918964">The only thing that we can document that the Social Security Administration really did differently is that it did not do much to defend black lung claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.556" offset="959819">It wrote regulations, as did the Department of Labor, that presumed all of these hard parts of the case in favor of the claimant, but it made no effort, or almost no effort, to assume the burden that it placed upon itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.706" offset="1024498">It is this practice, we believe, that the claimants want this Court to revive.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.217" offset="1062533">They don't want an adversary.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.790" offset="1268795">They're messy and complex regulations that were adopted by the Social Security Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.288" offset="1294813">But nevertheless, they do not say that they are irrebuttable.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.614" offset="1312054">And through the cross-references, which is apparently the way the Social Security Administration regulated in those days, you get to, and not on a very hard path, you get to provisions within those regulations that raise criteria that are identical to those criteria that the Department of Labor put in its regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.167" offset="1394288">The Department of Labor's regulations are neater.</text>

            <text syncTime="453.663" offset="1940247">There are very few cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.912" offset="1945262">But what we do know, and we readily concede that the factual issues that are presented in these kinds of cases are difficult ones, and they cannot be decided without expert testimony, without medical evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.296" offset="2010777">The Social Security Administration did not get the kind of expert testimony that exists in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.636" offset="2036168">Now, there is nothing anyplace that anybody has been able to find that show that these presumptions were rebuttable or that Social Security claims personnel were unable to look at evidence that came in the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.381" offset="2095101">They're not trained to function that way, it seems to me.</text>

            <text syncTime="611.223" offset="2570529">But the way the regulation is set up, and the Department of Labor certainly followed this, is they did it in a way so that the fact was presumed on the basis of something.</text>

            <text syncTime="718.462" offset="2999460">Justice O'Connor, in response to your question, we know relatively little about how HEW administered the program, but let me call to your attention two things that we do know that were reported in one of the GAO reports and in the congressional legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.938" offset="3077409">HEW reported that in cases where the record before it showed that a miner died from an automobile accident or from a malignancy in another organ of the body, it did not award benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="780.795" offset="3248773">And Justice White, in response to your question, you paraphrase Section 402(f)(2) in a way that I know we sometimes do, that it said that Labor was to adopt HEW's regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.305" offset="3318885">What Section 402(f)(2) actually says is that Labor is to apply criteria no more restrictive than those applicable on June 30, 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.610" offset="3376041">Now, HEW's regulation was applicable on that date, but so was... so were many other things, including part B of the act generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.232" offset="3418568">And I'd like to focus on the fact that the act provides repeatedly that black lung benefits are only to be awarded to persons who are totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.976" offset="3473530">The phrase "due to pneumoconiosis" captures both the requirement that the miner must have the disease, and the requirement that his disability must be caused by the disease.</text>

            <text syncTime="849.893" offset="3525148">Well, then, I suppose it would follow that if the regulations didn't provide for rebuttal on those... either one of those two bases, the regulation would be contrary to the statute?</text>

            <text syncTime="860.544" offset="3567780">That's our position exactly, Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.825" offset="3580946">The first section of the Black Lung Benefits Act says that its purpose is to provide benefits to miners totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.398" offset="3627235">The section authorizing HEW to promulgate regulations says that it is to set forth standards to determine whether a miner is totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.831" offset="3676972">The rate schedules have a provision for miners totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.454" offset="3703408">No provision of the act hints that anyone who is... does not have black lung disease or is disabled by some other cause is entitled to benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.325" offset="3742905">The three words, due to pneumoconiosis, in effect summarize Labor's third and fourth rebuttal provisions, the provisions at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.915" offset="3781253">We don't think that a regulation that implements the statute is contrary to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.663" offset="3812286">Dayton and Taylor, who do not have the disease, do not suggest any reason why they should be entitled to benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.048" offset="3853768">Pauley suggests that she should be awarded benefits because it's too difficult to determine what caused the disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.294" offset="3894833">Well, as I have just stated, the statute repeatedly sets forth a causation requirement, so Congress clearly thought that it was possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.821" offset="3932867">As Mr. Solomons says, doctors and agencies have been determining causes of disabilities for years under this program.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.629" offset="3972155">In many cases it is obviously quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.145" offset="3982186">The automobile accident hypothetical reveals a lot in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.533" offset="4003711">The claimants have absolutely no argument as to why benefits should not be awarded in such a case, and it seems quite clear to us that Congress did not intend such a result, which can fairly be characterized as absurd under the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1016.186" offset="4190330">We have actually emphasized different routes for miners who are not totally disabled, but we have both endorsed each others positions on that issue as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.835" offset="4244978">We think this Court's decision in the Turner Elkhorn case is very instructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.646" offset="4276221">That decision was handed down in 1976, 2 years before Section 402(f)(2) was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.377" offset="4307150">One of the provisions of the act, the one provision that sets forth an irrebuttable presumption for miners with the advanced stage of the disease, what was at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.138" offset="4354170">This Court rejected the coal company's claims that that presumption was affirmant of the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.651" offset="4384263">But even with respect to it the Court said that it's perfectly clear under the act that an operator can be liable only for pneumoconiosis arising out of employment in a coal mine, even though that particular provision didn't say that in so many words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.969" offset="4469527">We think that Congress, acting 2 years later in adopting Section 402(f)(2), must have also thought it perfectly evident under the act that an operator can be liable only for pneumoconiosis arising out of employment in a coal mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.464" offset="4531489">I'd like to say a word about an argument that the claimants have suggested with respect to the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.535" offset="4591780">They suggested that even if the operators can't be liable where a miner is not totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis, the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund can.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.953" offset="4637442">And they think that this avoids the constitutional problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.733" offset="4652593">Now we disagree on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.638" offset="4660221">We don't see how it really makes a difference whether an operator pays or whether a fund that is funded by a tax on coal sold by coal companies pays.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.822" offset="4696897">But we'd also like to note that the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund by its name seems to imply that it gives awards in cases involving black lung disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.363" offset="4747052">And furthermore I'd like to point out that the provision of the act that they rely on in making this argument just doesn't support their position at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.485" offset="4787594">That's Section 422(c) of the act, which says that no operator shall be responsible for paying benefits to a miner whose disability did not arise at least in part out of employment in a mine during a period after December 31, 1969, when it was operated by such miner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.288" offset="4870768">That provision just says that the trust fund pays benefits where the miner stopped working before the Black Lung Benefits Act was enacted, just as it does in cases where the operator isn't solvent or for some other reason isn't paying benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.048" offset="4937850">It does not suggest in any way that the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund is available where a miner either does not have black lung disease or is not disabled by it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1469.036" offset="6001765">Now, first with respect to the statutory question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.596" offset="6015976">The centerpiece of the 1978 amendments to the Black Lung Benefits Act was Section 402(f)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.343" offset="6047009">Section 402(f)(2) prohibited the Secretary of Labor from adjudicating claims using criteria that were more restrictive to claimants than the criteria in effect or applicable on June 30th, 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.993" offset="6113569">The question in this case would have been which criteria were applicable on June 30th, 1973, except that the, this Court's decision in Sebben has already answered that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.332" offset="6158918">Sebben answered it holding that the criteria applicable on June 30, 1973, include the criteria of the HEW interim provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.561" offset="6203848">And because the criteria of the HEW interim provision are the most favorable criteria to claimants, Section 402(f)(2) of the act prohibited the Secretary of Labor from using... from adjudicating claims using the criteria that are more restrictive than the criteria of the HEW interim provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.364" offset="6299039">So the HEW interim provision is the touchstone of Section 402(f)(2) of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.629" offset="6320146">Now the regulatory question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.471" offset="6331535">The regulatory question is whether any rebuttal criteria of the DOL interim regulation make that regulation more restrictive to claimants than the HEW interim provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.028" offset="6377719">Now this question has a straightforward resolution, just as the statutory question does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.183" offset="6398408">The HEW interim provision has two... has only two rebuttal tests, whereas the DOL interim regulation has four rebuttal tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.101" offset="6438010">The DOL regulation has the same two rebuttal tests as the HEW provision, and two additional ones as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.567" offset="6467894">The two additional rebuttal tests of the DOL regulation pertain to disability causation and to the presence of pneumoconiosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.265" offset="6506660">Each of the DOL interim regulation's two extra rebuttal tests makes it easier for opponents to rebut the HEW... the DOL interim regulation than to rebut the HEW interim regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.838" offset="6564965">So on its face, the DOL interim regulation is more restrictive to claimants than the HEW interim provision, in violation of Section 402(f)(2).</text>

            <text syncTime="1652.945" offset="6737373">When the HEW interim provision is carefully scrutinized in light of HEW's own interpretation of it in its Coal Miners Benefits Manual, no permissible interpretation of it can include any provisions like the two extra rebuttal tests of the DOL interim regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.845" offset="6809053">So the struggle in the questioning when my opponents were here talking to you was about what did HEW, what did the Social Security Administration really do in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.775" offset="6868717">What we know, and something that they did not mention, what we know is that they issued a... the Coal Miners Benefits Manual, they issued it 3 weeks after the HEW interim provision was promulgated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2941.443" offset="11891437">--Well, the, the backlog... HEW still would have had to assess the medical evidence, obtain it and then assess it, which was an enormous administrative undertaking, whether or not it's focussed on invocation or on rebuttal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark E. Solomons</label>
            <text syncTime="2980.615" offset="12048067">A few things, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.755" offset="12060606">First I would like to address some of the points that were made with respect to the GAO study.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.894" offset="12081190">Although I think that it is of limited significance, nevertheless, this was an investigation by the investigative arm of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.937" offset="12117344">They came in, they leveled charges at the agency, said you're not doing these things that you ought to be doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.202" offset="12138451">And the agency came back and they said, oh, well, it's real hard to do them, and we don't have the resources to do them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.604" offset="12164051">And then on the medical issues they said that... and this, by the way, as far as we know, never appeared in any congressional materials... they said, citing a magazine article, that it's very difficult to make these kinds of factual determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.365" offset="12219117">This is one of the most studied diseases on the face of the earth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.239" offset="12230611">A magazine article is hardly proof of anything in any form, it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.940" offset="12253390">But one of the things that's very interesting, the... looking only at this GAO report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.297" offset="12278781">Social Security on page 36 of the report told the investigators... I will read it to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.998" offset="12301664">Social Security officials told us that benefits were almost always denied in cases of deaths which occurred less than 24 hours after onset of acute diseases or traumas such as coronary occlusions or so forth and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.836" offset="12352968">I don't have a crystal ball to go back and tell you precisely how SSA would have handled any particular case, but neither do the claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.193" offset="12386405">It seems to me, however, that if they wanted to do something as radical as to adopt a... an irrebuttable presumption, to tell their employees, who have very few of those kinds of rebuttable presumptions in the jobs that they do, that this is the way you're going to do it, you're going to ignore evidence of certain types in these cases, that they would have done it somewhat more clearly than they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.996" offset="12485566">And in fact there is an irrebuttable presumption in the statute, and they did instruct their employees how to use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.758" offset="12508658">But this presumption, the Social Security presumption, is not one that was irrebuttable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.787" offset="12528825">I would also like to address the question of the meaning of the term criteria in Section 402(f)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.269" offset="12554738">It's a broad word.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.706" offset="12560485">It doesn't say adopt their regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.378" offset="12567173">It says adopt the criteria applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.221" offset="12578457">The criteria applicable include the statute, which had lots of criteria in them, and in many cases the responses of the claimants to that is that these are effectively repealed by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.108" offset="12618059">But I don't think you can make a case for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.247" offset="12626627">It includes the interim adjudicatory criteria, and it includes the rest of Social Security's regulations to the extent that they are applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.822" offset="12656929">Those regulations bring in, we think very clearly... as by the way does the manual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.945" offset="12673439">I think the manual is devastating to this case because the manual brings in all sorts of factual inquiries, as I read it, into causation and disease and anything that comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.253" offset="12722653">But let me address what's not a criterion, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.828" offset="12740939">Obtuseness in the drafting of this regulation is not a criterion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.124" offset="12754105">A lack of resources on the part of the Social Security Administration is not a criterion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.559" offset="12775839">Failure to file... follow the Federal Register Style Handbook, and not using... overusing cross-references is not a criterion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.979" offset="12805514">And the state of the medical art in 1972 is not a criterion either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.555" offset="12827875">It seems to me that the Department of Labor again did the job that it was supposed to do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.910" offset="12857236">Thank you.</text>
