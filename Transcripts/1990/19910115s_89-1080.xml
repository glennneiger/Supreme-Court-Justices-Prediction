            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73981">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No. 89-1080, Board of Education of Oklahoma City versus Dowell.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.687" offset="104701">In this case, black students and their parents challenged the Oklahoma City School Board's decision to assign students in grades one through four to neighborhood school.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.249" offset="142944">In earlier proceedings, Oklahoma City was found to have intentionally discriminated and to have created a dual system with separate schools for Blacks and Whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.124" offset="178471">In 1972, the District Court entered a decree imposing a school desegregation plan on the Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.734" offset="208877">In 1977, finding that the school district had achieved unitary status, the court issued an order terminating the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.193" offset="238657">In 1984, the board adapted the plan to reassign students in grades one through four to neighborhood schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.803" offset="265093">This resulted in a number of previously desegregated schools returning to primarily one-race school.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.725" offset="288812">The District Court held that this was a permissible action on the part of the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.772" offset="305008">The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.484" offset="319845">It said that a desegregation decree remains in effect until a school district can show grievance wrong evoked by new and unforeseen contentions, and that the circumstances in Oklahoma City had not changed enough to justify modification of the 1972 decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.859" offset="385361">In an opinion filed today with the clerk, we reverse the Court of Appeals and hold that its test for dissolving a desegregation decree is more stringent than is required by either this court's decision dealing with injunctions, or by the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.234" offset="450876">A school desegregation decree is not intended to operate forever for federal supervision of local systems always has been intended as a temporary measure to remedy past discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.578" offset="496224">The legal justification for displacing local authority in such cases is a violation of the constitution, and dissolving such a decree after local authorities have operated in compliance with it for a reasonable period is proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.016" offset="550037">We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.578" offset="564247">Justice Marshall, joined by Justices Blackmun and Stevens, has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.297" offset="583160">Justice Souter took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
