            <text syncTime="39.907" offset="283035">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="41.978" offset="291290">The issue in this case is whether a claim that a State tax violates the commerce clause of the United States Constitution is a claim that is cognizable under 42 U.S.C. section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.958" offset="343221">The pertinent part of section 1983 provides a Federal cause of action for legal and equitable relief against every person who under color of any statute of any State subjects any citizen of the United States to any... to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.042" offset="435590">In this case the Supreme Court of Nebraska upheld petitioner's claim that a Nebraska truck tax that he was required to pay violated the commerce clause and it affirmed a permanent injunction that the trial court had granted the petitioner in joining respondents, who were certain State tax officials, from collecting the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.867" offset="522943">Nevertheless, the court rejected petitioner's claim under section 1983, because it concluded that a State official's violation of the commerce clause did not deprive petitioner of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.408" offset="593056">The court relied mainly on the 1978 decision of the Eight Circuit in Consolidated Freightways v. Kassel, which held that the commerce clause does not establish individual rights against Government but instead allocates powers between the State and Federal Governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.880" offset="670901">The conclusion that the commerce clause does not secure individual rights, privileges, or immunities is, I submit, squarely at odds with many decisions of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="148.787" offset="718548">Well, there's language in decisions that talk about individuals benefiting from it as indeed they do, of course, by the Court's application of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.216" offset="768286">But it's a little hard to find in the language of the constitutional provision that we call the commerce clause any intent to benefit individuals in any direct sense?</text>

            <text syncTime="176.097" offset="827845">It's true, Justice O'Connor, that the commerce clause itself is merely a... states an affirmative grant of power to the Federal Congress to regulate interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.712" offset="870268">But it's been a fundamental precept of this Court's jurisprudence, at least since 1851 when it decided Cooley v. Board of Wardens, that the commerce clause in addition to granting power to the Federal Congress to regulate interstate commerce imposes specific obligations and restraints upon the State Governments of its own force.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.727" offset="1134313">I think Carter v. Greenhow is, is... does not support the decision below for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.492" offset="1161376">First of all, it was a... it involved, if anything, the contracts clause and not the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.913" offset="1187081">But second, the court in that case, contrary to what respondents have argued, did not hold that the contracts clause does not secure any rights under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.332" offset="1228772">In fact, it held the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.791" offset="1234623">It said that the contracts clause does secure rights under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.274" offset="1248521">But what it specifically held was that the plaintiff in that case had not asserted that violation of the contracts clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.430" offset="1281121">And as this Court has subsequently noted in Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization and in Hague v. CIO, Carter v. Greenhow was really... the result in that case was really based on the deficiencies in the plaintiff's pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.339" offset="1340785">In any event I submit that the decision below is inconsistent with this Court's decisions in at least three areas: in its decisions under the commerce clause; in its decisions under section 1983; and more broadly in its decisions under other provisions of the Constitution which allocate governmental powers but which this Court has held also secure individual protections enforceable by individuals.</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_a_allen" startTime="339.572" stopTime="416.563">
            <label>Mr. Richard A. Allen</label>
            <text syncTime="339.572" offset="1481742">I think Golden State Transit, Your Honor, squarely supports our submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.647" offset="1502013">The... in that case... in that case the court summarized the test that this Court has specifically fashioned to determine what constitutes a right, privilege, or immunity that's enforceable under section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.097" offset="1567841">It identified three factors, three considerations, that are relevant to that, to that inquiry, all of which I submit support the conclusion that the commerce clause creates constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.147" offset="1619982">First, the court stated in deciding whether a Federal right has been violated we've considered whether the provision in question creates obligations binding on the governmental unit or rather does no more than express a congressional preference for certain kinds of treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.774" offset="1682571">Second it stated that the interest that the plaintiff asserts must not be too vague or amorphous to be beyond the competence of the judiciary to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.880" offset="1718934">And third, the court has said we've also asked whether the provision in question was intended to benefit the punitive plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.116" offset="1747877">Under these criteria I submit that there can be no serious question that the commerce clause secures rights, privileges, and immunities enforceable under section 1983.</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_a_allen" startTime="423.487" stopTime="437.756">
            <label>Mr. Richard A. Allen</label>
            <text syncTime="423.487" offset="1817363">Well, I can only respectfully disagree, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.531" offset="1833559">I think there's no merit to the suggestion that the commerce clause was not intended to benefit individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.284" offset="1860517">But, let me just... go through these--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="437.756" stopTime="459.743">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="437.756" offset="1874415">Well, didn't it, didn't it really go to the structure of government and the authority to be given to the new Federal Government and the relationship between the Federal Government and the States that made up the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.286" offset="1928540">Do you really think that it gives any evidence of an intent to directly benefit individuals?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_a_allen" startTime="459.743" stopTime="529.477">
            <label>Mr. Richard A. Allen</label>
            <text syncTime="459.743" offset="1962395">--I think it does, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.232" offset="1968351">It is true that the commerce clause is a fundamental structuring provision of the Federal Constitution, indeed, may have been one of the principal causes for the Federal Constitution, and it allocates governmental powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.503" offset="2033448">But that is not to say, or that is not consistent... inconsistent with the proposition that it was also intended to benefit individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.769" offset="2070542">In fact, the proposition that the commerce clause... the contention that the commerce clause was not designed to benefit individuals was perhaps the most dramatically and clearly refuted by this Court's decision in Morgan v. Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.987" offset="2123414">And that was a case in which this Court upheld the claim of an interstate bus passenger challenging a State statute requiring segregation on interstate buses under the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.335" offset="2172733">The Court struck down that statute, and it rejected the claim by the State that the plaintiff had no enforceable rights under the commerce clause and the Court said constitutional protection against burden on... burdens on commerce is for her benefit.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="529.477" stopTime="537.892">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="529.477" offset="2241383">Well, is it analytically... is the case any different for commerce clause purposes than Gibbons v. Ogden?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_a_allen" startTime="537.892" stopTime="603.215">
            <label>Mr. Richard A. Allen</label>
            <text syncTime="537.892" offset="2275028">Well, this case, unlike Gibbons v. Ogden is a dormant commerce clause case.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.798" offset="2306584">In this case Gibbons v. Ogden really went off on Congress' power under the commerce clause and this is... this is a straight dormant commerce clause case.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.764" offset="2346499">But the Court in case after case under the dormant commerce clause has upheld the rights of individuals to enforce individual personal protections under the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.702" offset="2390281">And perhaps more importantly in those cases the Court has used the term rights to describe the protections that the commerce clause gives.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.937" offset="2423195">For example, in Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Commission, the Court upheld the claim of certain tax commissions that a New York statute violated the commerce clause, and it rejected the contention that those... that the plaintiffs were not entitled to raise those claims by saying that plaintiffs are asserting their right under the commerce clause to engage in interstate commerce free of discriminatory State taxation.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="603.215" stopTime="616.695">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="603.215" offset="2536253">Under your theory is there any violation of the Constitution by a State actor that does not give rise to a 1983 suit?</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_a_allen" startTime="616.695" stopTime="812.561">
            <label>Mr. Richard A. Allen</label>
            <text syncTime="616.695" offset="2590170">I can't think of any, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.986" offset="2599365">The respondents and the court below attempt to analogize the commerce clause to the supremacy clause, which of course this Court last term in Golden State Transit said was not itself a, a source of rights actionable under section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.458" offset="2677210">But the supremacy clause is very different from the commerce clause or really from any other provision of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.812" offset="2702705">Supremacy clause is merely a declaration of the supremacy of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.955" offset="2723290">It does not of itself impose any specific restraints or obligations on the States or on the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.620" offset="2749935">The commerce clause in contrast is a source of Federal rights and of... and of specific obligations that are imposed in the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.707" offset="2790268">And indeed in this very case, the court below imposed those obligations on the State of Nebraska, and they did so at the behest of petitioner in order to protect his interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.304" offset="2836661">It is I submit a contradiction in terms for the court below to conclude that the petitioner has an enforceable protection and yet has no right.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.421" offset="2881069">But again I think the... this Court's decisions that perhaps are clearest on this point are the decisions in Morgan v. Virginia and mostly clearly refute the decision of the court below that the commerce clause doesn't protect individual rights are Morgan v. Virginia, Boston Stock Exchange, and also United States v. Guest.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.157" offset="2972080">In United States v. Guest the Court upheld an indictment under the criminal counterpart to section 1983, which alleged that the defendants had violated the constitutional rights of certain black citizens to travel freely to and from the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.409" offset="3049089">The Court upheld that indictment and it said that the constitutional right to travel was based on the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.112" offset="3075838">I submit that... that this Court could not affirm the decision below without effectively overruling all of those decisions or at least calling them seriously into question.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.062" offset="3119724">Now, respondents have argued that those cases are not important because they didn't involve section 1983 and because they didn't involve the precise of what section 1983 means by rights, privileges, and immunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.110" offset="3183881">But there's no basis for the supposition that section 1983 intended the words rights, privileges, or immunities to have any different meaning from their commonly understood meaning or from their meaning in usage in other context.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.022" offset="3247515">Respondents in effect would have this Court employ a special vocabulary for section 1983 that's at odds with its ordinary meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.038" offset="3283564">As I... furthermore, as I've said respondents' contention that the commerce clause does not secure individual rights is inconsistent with the specific test that this Court fashioned and summarized in Golden State Transit v. Los Angeles for determining what constitutes a right, privilege, or immunity enforceable under section 1983.</text>

            <text syncTime="1208.950" offset="4959267">But furthermore, the, the dichotomy that the respondents and the court below seek to draw between, one the one hand the purpose of the commerce clause to allocate government powers and to serve national and broad societal interests, and on the other hand a purpose to benefit individuals is I submit a false dichotomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.617" offset="5053935">The fact that a constitutional provision my allocate powers and have a purpose to serve broad national interest does not mean that it is... does not also intend to serve and secure liberty for individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.603" offset="5101791">And in fact this Court has consistently rejected that dichotomy in cases involving provisions of the Constitution which allocate powers among the branches of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.973" offset="5151319">And perhaps for purposes of the issue in this case, that is, the question whether such provisions give rise to individual rights, the most telling decision is this Court's decision last term in United States v. Munoz-Flores where the Court rejected the Government's argument that the origination clause, which requires revenue measures to originate in the House of Representatives... rejected the Government's argument that that clause doesn't involve individual rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.141" offset="5268034">The Court... excuse me... the Court specifically stated that the Government's contention that the origination clause does not involve individual rights is erroneous and the Court said it had... it has repeatedly upheld provisions separating... in separation of powers cases, repeatedly upheld the claims of individuals seeking to enforce their own protections based on those provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.044" offset="5415574">I'd like to briefly address respondents' contention that the legislative history of section 1983 supports the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.084" offset="5467714">The court of... the Supreme Court of Nebraska made no reference to the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.245" offset="5484432">Respondents, however, have relied on it and they've relied primarily on certain remarks of Representative Shellabarger which appear to draw a distinction between provisions of the Constitution which relate to the division of powers between the State and Federal Government and provisions which secure the rights of individuals within the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.063" offset="5587668">And I think three things should be said about those remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.927" offset="5611179">First, there's nothing in those remarks that indicate that Congressman... Representative Shellabarger was expressing any view about the scope of the legislation that would become section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.705" offset="5658199">The thrust of his remarks appeared to be that remedial legislation was particularly necessary in the case of the latter-type provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.650" offset="5698010">But he did not say and he did not suggest that the legislation that he was supporting did not encompass all of the provisions of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.917" offset="5735103">And, indeed, the absence of any limiting or qualifying language refute any such suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.941" offset="5755166">Second, it's not clear what provisions Congressman... exactly what provisions Congressman Shellabarger would have put into which category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.407" offset="5797066">The examples he gave of power-providing provisions were the provisions providing that the States shall enter into no treaties, that they shall not coin money and they shall not emit letters of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.298" offset="5864671">The examples that he gave of the latter-type provisions were the fugitive-from-justice provision of the Constitution, the fugitive slave provision, and the privileges and immunities clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.095" offset="5911796">Most importantly, nothing in his remarks made any reference to the commerce clause, and there's simply no basis for the supposition that Congressman Shellabarger would have concluded that the dormant commerce clause did not create rights with respect to individuals as between individuals and the states--</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.230" offset="6000299">And, in fact, this Court's decisions... numerous decisions of this Court establish that the dormant commerce clause does establish rights with respect to individuals as between them and the States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2317.659" offset="9394023">And what did Congress mean when it used the words</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.591" offset="9405830">"rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution under section 1983. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2332.749" offset="9454418">Well, what you're saying is that they intended some shadowy distinction between rights that have a national interest and rights that don't have a national interest and I'm just trying to fathom whether that distinction makes enough sense that any rational person could have had it in mind.</text>

            <text syncTime="2364.260" offset="9580432">Does that... the origination of the Constitution, does that confer a private right which requires tax bills to be originated in the House and we have allowed suits to be brought alleging taxes to be unconstitutional when they are imposed under a taxing statute that did not originate in the House but originated in the Senate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2398.282" offset="9716583">That of course revolves on a consideration of separation of powers in that instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.514" offset="9733510">Now, perhaps because the separation of powers doctrine was primarily designed as a prevention against tyranny, you know, for individuals, then perhaps the Government--</text>

            <text syncTime="2414.902" offset="9783038">It would not implicate 1983, but your question is is there some individual right nevertheless, you know, obviously outside of 1983 because it involves Federal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.688" offset="9818147">Again, to give... to recognize the right of individuals to challenge that kind of an action is based, as I said, on probably a recognition that that type of constitutional protection, separation of powers, serves a very important function in the prevention of tyranny within the branches of government, and it of course represents a concern fundamentally different than the one we're raising here simply is the... the meaning of section 1983 again as set forth in the legislative history of the act by its principal sponsor and others and an understanding that not all constitutional provisions were covered by the act's rights, privileges, or immunities language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.453" offset="9973210">In addition to Representative Shellabarger, who I think's comments are highly relevant, we've also pointed out that other Representatives and even... and Senators at the time of the passage of the act recognized the same distinction between constitutional provisions that serves to deal with the relationship between individuals and the States, which were to be covered by the act, and the constitutional provisions recognizing distinction between the political powers between the States and the general Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.222" offset="10096299">Now, clearly it would appear that the commerce clause, although not specifically mentioned by Representative Shellabarger, falls in the category of a rights or a power-allocating provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.030" offset="10131512">And Representative Hoar specifically mentioned the commerce clause in his comments as we cited in your brief at page 36 and 37 in distinguishing those from the types of personal rights to be covered by the 1871 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.569" offset="10185742">Senator Trumbull recognized the same distinction, including a reference to interstate commerce being a, a provision dealing with national authority as opposed to an individual rights-granting provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.896" offset="10230986">We do not think that legislative history should be lightly dismissed as petitioner would ask us to do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.569" offset="10253660">In addition to the Morgan case petitioner has also relied almost heavily on Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.867" offset="10294934">We submit that the reference in Boston Stock exchange to a right to engage in interstate commerce it is included within a discussion of the standing of the exchanges to bring the act and talks about the adverse effect, injury in fact, requirements that deal simply with their standing to bring the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.426" offset="10357105">And if you look at the decision on the merits you will see that the actual basis for the Court's finding the tax unconstitutional in that case is an undue burden on interstate commerce focused on the free-trade purpose, in other words the national interest served by the, by the commerce clause and not the recognition of any individual right possessed by the exchanges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.891" offset="10439025">The non-application of section 1983 to claims of this nature we think is, is also demonstrated by some cases decided by the Court shortly after the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1871.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.819" offset="10502659">In 1885 again, the Carter v. Greenhow case in which the Court distinguished between the language and the Federal question statute, the broader arising under the constitution language as opposed to the more limited 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.880" offset="10562950">The significance of that I think is that it recognized that shortly after the act that not all constitutional violations were intended to be within the scope of section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.296" offset="10600566">Again, Bowman v. Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company, another 1885 decision, involved the claim on commerce clause grounds that a State statute restricting interstate delivery liquor violated the plaintiff's right to engage in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.867" offset="10666917">The Court there indicated that while that claim may be one arising under the Constitution, it did not State a claim for the deprivation of any rights secured by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.901" offset="10698996">We believe that there are additional considerations that would militate against the Court's expanding section 1983 to commerce clause litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.768" offset="10746539">The major impact of section 1983 here would be simply to permit a recovery of attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.604" offset="10773810">When Congress enacted the attorney fee statute in 1976 to ensure effective access to the courts, we find it difficult to believe that commerce clause litigation was among the type of cases that Congress was concerned was being denied effective access to the courts, given the long history of commerce clause litigation in the country.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Allen</label>
            <text syncTime="2854.583" offset="11541810">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.493" offset="11557379">First, I'd like to respond to the contention that United States v. Guest did not base the decision there on the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.402" offset="11608997">That's simply incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.922" offset="11615162">Guest squarely rested the violation, the alleged violation, of the identical statutory language on the commerce clause at 383 U.S. at 758 the Court said, in Edwards v. the People of the State of California invalidating a California law which impeded the free interstate passage of an indigent, the Court based its reaffirmation of the Federal right of interstate travel upon the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.914" offset="11739087">This ground of decision was consistent with precedents firmly establishing that the Federal commerce power surely encompasses the movement in interstate commerce of persons as well as commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.360" offset="11784854">And for that reason they upheld count four of that indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.533" offset="11797601">Second, with respect to the contention that Bowman v. Chicago Northwestern Railroads somehow supports petitioner, that's simply incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.651" offset="11845980">Again, Bowman did not... did not hold that the commerce clause did not secure rights under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.928" offset="11883179">What the Court in Bowman held was that the plaintiff's claim in the case against the railroad was simply a State law claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.993" offset="11915361">In other words, a claim that the railroad was obliged by the State law of common carriage to carry his commodities, and that's why the Court rejected his claim and found that it did not fall within the jurisdictional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.090" offset="11963740">And an interesting contrast of Bowman, I think, is a case around the same period which is one of the early cases enforcing the dormant commerce clause against a discriminatory State tax, and that's Guy v. Baltimore in 19... in 1879.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.852" offset="12034793">And in that case, the Court struck down a Baltimore worthage fee that was imposed only on ships that came into Baltimore carrying out-of-State commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.987" offset="12067394">And the court said if the prohibition against discriminatory taxation were not in the commerce clause,</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.754" offset="12106473">"It is easy to perceive how the power of Congress to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States could be practically annulled. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.967" offset="12135312">--and this is the important part...</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.509" offset="12141477">"and the equality of commercial privileges secured by the Federal Constitution to citizens of the several States materially abridged and impaired. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.615" offset="12181915">Clearly the Court at that time viewed the commerce clause as securing privileges to the citizens of the several States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.831" offset="12210754">Reference was made to remarks of other Congressmen and particularly Congressman Hoar during the debates on section... on 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.546" offset="12253595">If you read Congressman Hoar's remarks, basically he was engaging in a dissertation on the Constitution and explaining how there were different types of provisions, but there's nothing in his remarks that suggest that he understood the proposed legislation as not including rights under the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.650" offset="12329977">Finally I'd like to address briefly the respondents' argument that if this Court recognizes that--</text>
