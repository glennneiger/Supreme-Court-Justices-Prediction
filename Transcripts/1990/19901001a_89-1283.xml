            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="11.119" offset="174847">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.455" offset="204209">Petitioners are 15 small villages and towns in Ohio that purchase electricity from the Ohio Power Company for the purpose of reselling it to their residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.528" offset="236496">Ohio Power is an electric utility company that sells electricity at wholesale, and is part of a public utility holding system called the American Electric Power Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.274" offset="271500">That company is registered under the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and as a consequence of that, Ohio Power is subject to regulation by both the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Securities Exchange Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.423" offset="324059">At issue in this case is the division of regulatory authority specified in section 318 of the Federal Power Act between these two agencies in connection with Ohio Power's wholesale electric rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.360" offset="371810">The rates Ohio Power charges to petitioners are significantly affected by the cost of coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.035" offset="394485">Coal represents approximately 50 percent of the total cost of the production of electricity by the Ohio Power Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.470" offset="420294">The issue in this case arises because Ohio Power does not purchase its coal on the open market, but rather it purchases most of its coal from a wholly owned subsidiary called the Southern Ohio Coal Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.319" offset="463657">Between 1971 and 1980 Ohio Power went to the Securities Exchange Commission and asked for four separate orders with respect to the coal mined by the Southern Ohio Coal Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.935" offset="506080">The first one provided essentially for the creation of the coal mining operation and asked for securities to be issued for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.610" offset="532829">The second one followed up by an additional grant of securities in order to provide an actual operating opportunity for that coal company.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.344" offset="563758">And the last two orders also provided for the issuance of securities in order to upgrade the quality of the mining operations by that coal company.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.240" offset="595314">Nothing in those orders specifically refers to the Ohio Power and Southern Ohio Coal Company and the sale of coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.104" offset="630841">They simply refer generally to these basic transactions under a host of provisions of the security... of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, but not section 13(b) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act which is the provision that specifically regulates these kinds of inter-affiliate coal transactions.</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="141.807" offset="697610">Mr. Phillips, what is the effect of the SEC order?</text>
            <text syncTime="144.879" offset="709939">Does it require that coal be purchased at cost, or is it just a ceiling?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="150.912" stopTime="183.550">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="150.912" offset="734077">To the extent it applies at all, it would... it would clearly be just a ceiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.858" offset="753825">But what it seems to me clearly, what I think is in fact the case is it doesn't say anything about how it has to be purchased.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.534" offset="776499">What it does is recite an intention by Ohio Power essentially to comply with an unstated section 13(b), whatever section 13(b) requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.460" offset="812235">The way I would read the order, it simply says we will comply with the Federal standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="610.965" offset="2574246">Well what does... but see, the reason for that is that section 13(b) doesn't say things have to follow at cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.341" offset="2595771">What section 13(b) says is you cannot have an interaffiliate contract, period, unless you satisfy certain requirements of the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.224" offset="2623252">And one of those requirements is language that says at cost economically and efficiently allocated among the various parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.830" offset="2657734">So it is not a strict at-cost standard such that Congress said in 13(b) this is how you have to operate in terms of interaffiliate contracts.</text>

            <text syncTime="647.000" offset="2718338">I think it's important to step back for a second, because the truth is whatever the SEC has said about how Ohio Power and the Southern Ohio Coal Companies should entertain the idea of selling the coal between themselves, that is nevertheless fundamentally different from the question of how much the Ohio Power Company can charge its rate payers.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.817" offset="2809662">And that is really the essence of what the issue is in this case under section 318.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.129" offset="2826903">The question here is is there a conflict between those two provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.833" offset="2845711">And the reason we need to get to that analysis is because I think we can all agree, or should all at least agree that the D.C. Circuit erred in its construction of section 318, which says that simply because this is a matter within the jurisdiction of the SEC under section 13(b), that for that reason alone FERC is ousted of its important rate-making authority over a component of cost that represents essentially 50 percent of the rates that get charged to the petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.431" offset="2956157">What the... what we know from both the SEC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is that they are in complete agreement with the petitioners that the court of appeals erred by over broadly construing the restrictions on section... in section 318.</text>

            <text syncTime="1013.988" offset="4186315">The question, the statutory question before the Court involves the proper reconciliation of two different levels of overlap and duplication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.419" offset="4240023">On one level there is the problem of the imposition of duplicative and possibly conflicting requirements on particular regulated entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.765" offset="4285476">But on the second level, there is the problem of the extent to which the SEC is to be called upon to provide the full panoply of rate regulatory functions and expertise for holding company affiliates that FERC otherwise provides if those functions are to be provided at all in the context of holding company affiliates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.702" offset="4389234">And the basic concern of the two Federal agencies before the Court today is that the court of appeals has interpreted section 318 of the Federal Power Act in a manner that goes too far in eliminating overlap and the mere possibility of conflict on the first level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.086" offset="4482752">And the necessary effect of that interpretation is to require impractical duplication of mission by the SEC and FERC on the second level, because FERC will be disabled--</text>

            <text syncTime="1652.814" offset="6741613">The SEC joined in the brief before this Court, but the only time the SEC has spoken to the conflict question was when Sherman Shad of the SEC testified before Congress in 1982 when he was urging an appeal of the holding company act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.177" offset="6815069">And he pointed out that section 318 was there to prevent overlapping jurisdiction, and that in point of fact when it comes to affiliate transactions the SEC applies a different price standard than the FERC applies to utilities subject to its jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1858.941" offset="7566142">Section 318 asks two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.993" offset="7578367">It asks first what is the subject matter that each agency seeks to regulate, and has the SEC imposed a requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.106" offset="7606788">There is no dispute, there can be no dispute before you that the subject matter that each agency seeks to regulate is in fact the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.974" offset="7646286">The court of appeals said that each agency is seeking to determine the price that Ohio Power reasonably should have paid for the coal that it purchased from its affiliate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1894.714" offset="7709293">Yet before you no one seeks to justify, to defend that subject matter rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.231" offset="7739281">It was the essential rationale, Justice Stevens, of the FERC for a very good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.386" offset="7763941">Admittedly, the FERC express some confusion as to whether or not the SEC was imposing cost in all cases or only cost as a ceiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.229" offset="7823291">I think, by the way, that it was imposing cost in all cases, and I will come back to that in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.314" offset="7843667">But what the FERC was saying, it said we assume that it was cost as a ceiling, and it happened to be the case that at the time the FERC issued its order, market price was below cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.000" offset="7894344">Hence it said there's no irreconcilability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.253" offset="7907406">But the FERC went on to explain the rationale of its market decision, and it said very clearly, you can find this on page 63a of the appendix to the petition, it said under all rationale it is absolutely essential that Ohio Power be able to charge market, irrespective of its relationship to cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.721" offset="8001237">That Ohio Power be required to charge market even when it exceeds cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.853" offset="8029763">That was the essential underpinning of the FERC's holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.317" offset="8047631">So even if you believe that the SEC set cost merely as a limit, it clearly is the case that FERC says Ohio Power must be allowed, if it its rule is to have any vitality, must be allowed to pierce that limit when market exceeds cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="2210.418" offset="8972052">Congress... and this portion of legislative history is conceded by everyone in this case...

            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="3349.455" offset="13528225">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.918" offset="13542018">I believe in evaluating the case as it comes to the Court at this point it is important to keep in mind initially that the FERC here is attempting to protect the consumers by the rates that it allows to be charged and the charges that it allows Ohio Power to pass through.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.378" offset="13595935">And that that exercise of authority should only be set aside in the most unmistakable... if supported by the most unmistakable terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.481" offset="13624356">We turn first to section 13(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.785" offset="13633551">It is difficult for me to tell whether Ohio Power believes section 13(b) ousts the FERC of its authority, but the SEC has clearly said that it does not, and the SEC's rule clearly says that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.533" offset="13676496">And notwithstanding Mr. Berlin's comment to the contrary, rule 92 does not set up an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.776" offset="13697499">Rule 92, if you read the SEC and FERC's... or, excuse me, the FERC's reply brief, says that the price is "not limited to cost" when you are talking about interaffiliate sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.223" offset="13735324">So rule 92 provides no mechanism for doing away with the FERC's effort here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.486" offset="13752356">So the only question then are these four orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.888" offset="13761969">There has been a lot of discussion as to what those four orders mean, but I submit to you the Court is not obliged to have to worry about the specific meaning of those four orders, because I am prepared to give Mr. Berlin the fuller... the fullest reading of those orders, which is really what they want here, is for Ohio Power to pay a certain price for the coal that it purchases from the Southern Ohio Coal Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.201" offset="13843157">Even given that interpretation, which is the broadest available and the broadest they've asserted, it still remains available for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to step in and say but we do not permit you to charge that amount in the rates that you set for electricity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.210" offset="13903239">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.651" offset="13905015">Because these are not irreconcilable conflicts in the obligations of the Ohio Power Company under these circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="3450.487" offset="13932287">Well, it wasn't irreconcilable conflict in Nantahala either, but one doesn't... just as one doesn't interpret a Federal-State relationship to allow the trapping of costs, one should not interpret two Federal agency relationships to trap costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.605" offset="13988816">Now as I understand it, the holding company acquired this asset with an understanding under section 13(b) of the Public Utility Holding Company that the SEC would... would make sure that the contracts are performed at cost.</text>
