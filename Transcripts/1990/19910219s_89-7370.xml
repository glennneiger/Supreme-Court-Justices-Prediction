            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73972">The second case is Gozlon-Peretz versus the United States No. 89-7370.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.155" offset="114514">Between 1984 and 1987, congress enacted or changed various statutes to increase the severity of criminal sentences for drug offenders and to reform the criminal sentencing process in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.973" offset="165819">One of these changes was to move to a new concept for court supervision in monitoring after a sentence has been served.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.167" offset="206570">Under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, congress adapted the system called supervised release to replace the earlier system which have been called special parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.833" offset="249201">Supervised release required a Sentencing Court rather than the United States Parole Commission to oversee a defendants behavior and adjustment after being released from custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.398" offset="295490">Supervised release gave the Sentencing Court greater powers and responsibilities in this post-confinement period.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.059" offset="322135">So the courts and court officials would have time to prepare for the change, the provisions for supervised release in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 did not become effective until 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.679" offset="364663">The problem we confront in this case on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is this, during the interim period before the Sentencing Reform Act took effect congress enacted another statute, the Anti-drug Abuse Act of 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.456" offset="423699">The Anti-drug Abuse Act requires terms of supervised release for most drug offenders, but it does not provide an exquisite effective date for its relevant provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.088" offset="462256">The petitioner who committed his offense during this interim period argues that because the Sentencing Reform Act, with its basic definition of supervised release, did not become effective until 1987, the ADAA's provision for supervised release likewise were not effective until that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.631" offset="532473">So, he argues that he is not subject to special parole or perhaps not subject to post-confinement monitoring at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.928" offset="557655">We must interpret the Anti-drug Abuse Act of 1986 to determine whether its provisions for supervised release apply in this interim period.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.999" offset="589943">We hold that they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.424" offset="595585">When the ADAA was enacted, it is true that the Sentencing Reform Act was not operational, but it had been adapted by the congress and signed by the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.723" offset="628813">It had all of the weight and dignity of a statute and the reasonable assumption is that when congress had passed the ADAA and used the term supervised release, it knew its full definition and meaning and legislative with reference to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.987" offset="681894">Courts may refer to enact it, but yet effective legislation to interpret statutory terms if the legislature intends to reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.190" offset="714703">In this case, we believe the legislature did have that intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.588" offset="728287">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals holding that supervised release is applicable in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.877" offset="749394">The opinion is unanimous.</text>
