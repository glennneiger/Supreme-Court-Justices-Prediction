            <text syncTime="18.095" offset="200946">This is a statutory construction case revisiting the preemption provisions of the ERISA statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.239" offset="237517">The issue is whether they preempt the application of State antisubrogation automobile insurance laws as applied directly to self-funded employee welfare plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.870" offset="300107">The courts of appeals have decided three cases involving this exact question.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.155" offset="325184">Two have found preemption as to self-funded plans, whereas one, the Third Circuit below, found no preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.013" offset="360606">In all the courts of appeals have address nine cases involving essentially this question of which seven have found preemption and two, including the court below, found no preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.830" offset="407940">Now the section 514, the preemption provision of the ERISA, contains a tripartite preemption provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.928" offset="448273">First, there is the broad preemption clause that this Court has had occasion to construe on a number of occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.575" offset="478889">Secondly, there is an insurance savings clause, so called, which exempts from the general preemption provision, the traditional State area of insurance regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.566" offset="534895">Thirdly, there is the so-called deemer clause, which indicates... which is at issue here and this is the first time that this Court has had the third provision, the deemer clause, directly before it, although you had occasion to analyze it rather thoroughly in considering the savings clause in the case of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.983" offset="628518">Now the broad preemption clause has been held to be deliberately expansive, designed to establish a pension plan regulation as exclusively a Federal concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.371" offset="682121">Preempted are State laws which relate to an ERISA plan... that's the statutory term... in that they affect the administration of a plan or directly impact the provisions of a plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.331" offset="741890">Now the courts of appeal have uniformly held that State insurance laws prohibiting the subrogation of automobile injury claims relate to ERISA insofar as they are attempted to be applied to ERISA plans and they are thus preempted unless saved by the insurance savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.647" offset="831124">The plan here... the law here in Pennsylvania relates to this plan, because it reaches right into the plan as promulgated and removes a provision calling for the plan to have the right of subrogation when the planned beneficiary recovers against a third party tort feasor.</text>

            <text syncTime="278.270" offset="1241664">It's more than just purporting to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.212" offset="1249397">It says purporting to regulate insurance companies, insurance contracts, banks, trust companies, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.839" offset="1279908">That's... I don't know that the phrase needs particular definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.003" offset="1304567">Although, you know, the word purporting to is what the Third Circuit seized upon and suggested that the inclusion of the word purporting in that statute amounted to the word pretextually.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.153" offset="1365171">Or the State had, through some back door or pretextual method, endeavored to regulate these plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.372" offset="1414072">I don't believe we need to go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.103" offset="1425044">Indeed, the briefs that have been filed in this Court by my friends here do not attempt to defend that interpretation as it was rendered in the Third Circuit, which I must say was also the interpretation that the Sixth Circuit took in the Northern Group case.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.065" offset="1500799">They both seemed to think that that would purport somehow implied a pretextual approach which we don't think is justified by the... by the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.496" offset="1562552">The deemer clause does not necessarily have to attack a pretextual expansion of State regulation but one which goes beyond the regular historical exception of the insurance industry as we have known it in the McCarran-Ferguson Act and elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.265" offset="1669655">Now, in Metropolitan Life this Court saved a mandated benefits law as applied to an insured plan, but noted that the same law would be preempted as to a self-funded plan, and pointed out that while the Court recognized that that placed some difference between self-funded plans and insured plans, that that was a difference that was inherent in the program established by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.134" offset="1789086">And in order to reach that analysis, the Court analyzed the whole of section 314, the whole preemption section, so that most of the courts of appeals have followed the analysis set forth in the Metropolitan Life case.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.558" offset="1866827">And I think that would be careful approach for the courts of appeals because after all, while it was not the holding of Metropolitan Life, it was nonetheless an integral of that Court... of your Court's analysis only 5 years ago, a unanimous Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.901" offset="1940179">The Third Circuit, in addition to injecting a pretextual concept, also injected some... another new concept that isn't founded in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.740" offset="1991588">And that was what was called the core ERISA concept that they used to say that subrogation laws were not within the core ERISA concerns and therefore the anti-subrogation laws would not be dealt with by the deemer provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.675" offset="2079255">On the other hand, the Sixth Circuit, in straying from the implications and analysis of Metropolitan Life, injected a theory of balancing State versus Federal interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.435" offset="2138291">And that is, again, not grounded at all in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.378" offset="2154069">The court indicated that in looking at a particular State regulation, that there should be a balancing as to the relative significance that the State had in the matter had versus the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.808" offset="2215823">And here again that seemed to have no basis in the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="622.818" offset="2619885">And I reread three articles that are cited in the briefs which somehow brought the matter into focus to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.235" offset="2657501">And those are the 1967 law review article by Mr. Goetz, the 1976 article by Brummond, and the 1973 note in the Georgetown Law Review.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.062" offset="2704835">Those are all cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.953" offset="2708388">And what those three articles did was describe, each of them in their own different perspective, the historical conditions that were existing at the time Congress enacted ERISA in '74.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.984" offset="2764499">And it was this in the late 1960's and early '70's, these self-funded or uninsured plans were growing in both number and size.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.803" offset="2807757">The State insurance commissioners were viewing these phenomena.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.058" offset="2832835">They didn't appear to be within the definitional jurisdiction of the State insurance commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.720" offset="2859480">They... but the commissioners nonetheless viewed them as something rather like insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.604" offset="2886961">So, they were trying to decide how to expand their regulatory turf as it were.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.190" offset="2909321">Two proposals were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.160" offset="2917263">One, model legislation was proposed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.476" offset="2946520">However, that model legislation was never adopted in any State.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.079" offset="2968881">So, failing the legislative route, the State sought judicial determinations that self-funded plans were the equivalent of insurance and were therefore within the purview of the existing State regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.418" offset="3026246">There was a Monsanto case in the Missouri State court system that illustrates this.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.092" offset="3048920">Now, in 1974 when this pulling and tugging was going on, the Congress enacts ERISA and it would appear very logical if Congress had been aware of the efforts of the State insurance commissioners to expand their regulatory power to incorporate the health care... the self-funded benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.861" offset="3152051">And I would suggest that based on this... I grant you, Your Honor, extrinsic evidence or historical context that the deemer clause was intended to resolve this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.082" offset="3208894">And it was intended to resolve it in favor of the application of Federal law and ERISA rather than encouraging the expansion of the State insurance commissions' power in this manner.</text>

            <label>Mr. David L. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="1189.379" offset="4886059">Your Honor, Congress did not give us... I should have said thank you, Mr. Chief Justice... Congress did not elaborate in great detail on why in the first place it excepted insurance regulation from the scope of preemption, and that brought the plan itself under... plans themselves outside the scope of the savings clauses, as we argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.787" offset="4991699">But I believe that the explanation lies in the combination of two factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.712" offset="5011447">One is the long standing recognition of State interests in the areas of traditional insurance regulation, a recognition that's embodied in the McCarran-Ferguson Act and which led to the enactment of the savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.121" offset="5077067">I think it was then realized, particularly as the preemption clause was broadened out at conference, although the deemer predates that, I think it was realized that if the plans themselves would be subject to regulation under this recognition of traditional State power, that the purpose of preemption, both the original narrow purpose of preemption and the broader purpose of preemption as it emerged from conference would be severely... severely thwarted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.064" offset="5220845">So, I think the reason for this distinction is that effort which is bewildering admittedly at times had effort to preserve State power to regulate insurance companies and insurance in traditional ways but not to regulate plans directly through that device.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.768" offset="5295659">And that's why I think the deemer clause is such an essential complement to the saving clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.612" offset="5323036">The time that I have available I would like to focus on an argument that... that is made for the first time in this Court by the respondent and by her amicus, the National Conference of State Legislatures, in an approach that is very different from the approach of the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.546" offset="5406732">They argue that while the savings clause is a broad reservation of State authority to regulate insurance, the deemer clause is, in its turn, only a very narrow exemption to the savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.796" offset="5467754">They say that the deemer clause relates only to those laws that regulate insurance as a business, a phrase that they do not exactly define but which appears to govern such State laws as those affecting licensing or capital structure requirements or perhaps premium levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.403" offset="5558242">The deemer clause in their view leaves very broad authority to regulate benefit plans directly as a result of the savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.432" offset="5602337">We submit that argument fails on every ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.965" offset="5616443">It fails because it's contradicted by the broad text of the deemer clause, and we believe it fails because it is flatly inconsistent with the purpose of the preemption provisions that this Court has recognized in such cases as Fort Halifax and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.429" offset="5686347">Looking first at the text of the deemer clause, the respondents emphasize the phrase that no plan shall be deemed to be an insurance company or to be engaged in the business of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.268" offset="5745697">They go on the fact that the deemer clause is much broader.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.820" offset="5763878">It says no plan shall be deemed to be an insurance company or other insurer or engaged in the business of insurance, and then there follows a clause that they studiously ignore for purposes of any law of any State regulating insurance companies or insurance contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.733" offset="5839529">We submit that section 1719 of the Pennsylvania law is plainly a law of the State regulating insurance contracts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1451.089" offset="5932943">And what they're saying is if that's the manner of bringing the person under State regulation, it just doesn't apply to ERISA fund.</text>

            <text syncTime="1466.019" offset="5992711">I think first the word purporting as such does not mean that the State has to expressly deem someone to be an insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.958" offset="6036388">Purporting could be expressly or by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.959" offset="6048404">The dictionary is clear on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.571" offset="6054882">We don't think purporting requires either a pretext, as the court below suggests, or a specific announced purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.579" offset="6094902">We think the fact that this State law deals with insurance subrogation provisions is sufficient to satisfy the word purporting.</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Woodruff Turner</label>
            <text syncTime="1511.996" offset="6176613">No, we don't think it... in fact the word purporting is also found in the statute in the definition of a State, and the use of the word purporting there I think is very similar to the use here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.555" offset="6226768">That is, the definition of the word State would add the meaning of the preemption provision also contains the word purporting in the same context that we claim it is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.741" offset="6267519">With respect to the word "person" that you focus on in the savings clause, we believe that the question is whether the deemer clause effectively takes this out of the savings clause because this State law, the State law that is at issue here, is a law which we submit does regulate insurance contracts and, in doing so, deems a plan to be an insurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.175" offset="6401266">Indeed, if the plan were not an insurer for purposes of this law regulating insurance contracts, the case would not fall within the savings clause at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.813" offset="6443793">In other words, we believe the very factors that bring it within the savings clause also bring it within the deemer clause because the plan is effectively deemed by the State law to be an insurer for the purposes of a law regulating insurance contracts, telling insurers that they are not allowed to put a subrogation provision in their contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.912" offset="6552254">If they do, they will be void.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.032" offset="6560717">The effect of the respondent's argument we submit is to give the States very broad authority to regulate plans directly outside the very limited area of... of capitalization requirements and licensing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.753" offset="6631561">It would allow them to regulate such matters as fiduciary responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.398" offset="6650161">It would allow them to regulate disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.648" offset="6659147">The very core concern that the court below conceded was foreclosed to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.692" offset="6683388">Moreover, it would allow the States free reign to prohibit provisions and plans, require provisions and plans, eliminate efforts of the plans to achieve uniform administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.953" offset="6740440">In our view the most remarkable statement in the brief of the NCSL is that the deemer clause is simply not directed at the relationship between the insured and his insurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.591" offset="6790908">Now the respondents and their amici suggest that the effect of our argument is to leave a regulatory vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.996" offset="6824554">We submit that it is not a regulatory vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.248" offset="6837615">It is a recognition in the preemption provisions of Federal responsibility, responsibility of the courts to develop a Federal common law to deal with these issues, a responsibility on Congress to engage in continuing oversight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.191" offset="6905325">Both branches have been meeting that responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.363" offset="6918072">Congress has several times amended the deemer clause, the preemption provisions to allow a wise health care act, to deal with special problems of multi-employer plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.925" offset="6976273">Congress and the courts have been recognizing the responsibility that the preemption provisions impose on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.439" offset="7006366">And so for those reasons and because the respondent's argument would undue the clear purpose of the preemption clause, we join the petitioner in urging--</text>

            <text syncTime="1836.281" offset="7473749">The petitioner and the Solicitor General don't provide that answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.282" offset="7485766">They say that the deemer clause was designed essentially to take away from the States so far as self-insured plans are concerned all of the regulatory authority that was given back to them by the savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.353" offset="7538010">But that can't possibly be right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.984" offset="7548564">Because the savings and deemer clauses don't use symmetrical language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.247" offset="7561625">A savings clause saves all State laws in the language of the statute that regulate insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.451" offset="7586389">It uses general terms, that regulate insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.904" offset="7596211">The deemer clause in contrast says that ERISA plans can't be deemed to be insurance companies for a narrower subset of laws, laws that purport to regulate insurance companies or insurance contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.413" offset="7646262">So there must be some laws that are saved by the savings clause as a general regulation of insurance that are not preempted by the deemer clause because they did not purport to regulate insurance companies or insurance contracts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2078.751" offset="8443623">Again, Your Honor, I think it's important to look at the entire package or preemption provisions which were written at the same time and were designed to be read together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.838" offset="8475911">The preemption clause, as Mr. Turner has said, is written very broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.109" offset="8493047">It uses the language "relate".</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.922" offset="8500257">It says it preempts all State laws that relate to ERISA plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.775" offset="8515721">The deemer clause, in contrast, uses much narrower language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.847" offset="8527947">It says laws that regulate insurance companies or insurance contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.449" offset="8542366">So, it can't be that every State law that affects an insurance company or affects insurance contracts is preempted by the deemer clause or there would be no explanation for the differing language used in the two provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.250" offset="8589596">Indeed, as Justice O'Connor suggested in... in her question, the Court has interpreted the term regulate in the savings clause... the term "regulate insurance"... in the Pilot Life decision of a few years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.396" offset="8634213">And the court there said in accordance with the common understanding of the term to regulate insurance it is not enough that a law happens to affect insurance generally or that even that it's principal effect is on insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.117" offset="8689070">It must be specifically directed to insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.570" offset="8698892">I think the same... since the same word is used in the deemer clause, it must have the same meaning and, therefore, a law that purports to regulate insurance companies or insurance contracts must be a law that is directed specifically at insurance companies or insurance contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.009" offset="8756675">And the anti-subrogation provision, quite clearly as I said, is not such a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.983" offset="8772557">I think that interpretation is even stronger in the deemer clause as Justice Stevens' question suggested, because it uses the language "purport".</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.441" offset="8806308">And to purport to do something I think seems to have a common understanding that it does it in terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.416" offset="8826265">And that accords I think with the terms used throughout the preemption provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.240" offset="8849566">So, as I said, the language of the... of the deemer clauses and the savings clause simply are not symmetrical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.817" offset="8879868">The deemer clause was written after the language of the savings clause was in place and, therefore, I think presumably Congress meant something by using different statutory language and, therefore, it cannot be as petitioner and the Solicitor General say that the deemer clause simply takes away from the States everything that the savings clause gave to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2286.126" offset="9273063">In answering Justice Stevens' related question, Mr. Turner suggested that Congress' purpose was to slice apart self-insurance from the insurance industry, people engaged in the business of insurance as you've described.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.119" offset="9341086">What he didn't answer, Justice Stevens' question, why Congress would want to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.661" offset="9355192">And I can't imagine any reason why Congress would want to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.284" offset="9369717">But the answer that is provided in the briefs of petitioner and the Solicitor General is that it might be more expensive for self-insurers to provide self-insurance if they have to comply with State laws like the antisubrogation provision and that might discourage them from creating plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.293" offset="9429798">And they similarly say that if might be an administrative inconvenience if self-insurers must comply with varying State laws in different States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.811" offset="9463862">But to the extent those points are valid and I should say those are the only ERISA policies that they pointed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.975" offset="9480476">They are... those points are valid to precisely the same extent of fully insured plans as to which they concede, as they must, that States laws are fully applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.893" offset="9516211">It will be more expensive perhaps for a employer to purchase insurance from an insurance company if the insurance company can't assert a subrogation right, just... just as it will perhaps be more expensive for a self-insurer to provide self-insurance if it can't assert a subrogation right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.276" offset="9585697">And so far as administrative convenience is concerned, virtually all self-insurers like petitioner itself hire insurance companies to operate their plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.391" offset="9618193">So, it's no more inconvenient for a self-insurer than for a fully insured plan to comply with varying State laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.067" offset="9640868">It's impossible to imagine why Congress, given the policies of ERISA, would have wanted to draw that kind of distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.973" offset="9668453">Now, in fact, I think it's clear from the background of the provisions, and I think the very background that Mr. Turner alluded to and some of the sources that he alluded to, what distinction Congress actually did want to draw.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.921" offset="9716309">It was concerned, as the language of the deemer clause suggests... as your question suggested, Justice Scalia... Congress was concerned with State laws that are directed at business, people engaged in the insurance business in particular, as Mr. Shapiro I think very nicely summarized, types of laws that are applied to insurance companies... licensing laws, perhaps reserve and capitalization requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.117" offset="9813067">And the reason why Congress would be concerned with those types of statutes is quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.062" offset="9832815">It would... if the ERISA plans had to comply with those types of business regulations, self-insurance would effectively become impossible, and all ERISA plans potentially would be subject to State licensing and notification requirements, which are of course precisely the requirements that are imposed by the ERISA statute and which Congress presumably did not want States to duplicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.677" offset="9919333">If self-insurers had to comply with those sorts of laws, they would have to obtain certificates of authority from State insurance departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.794" offset="9951725">They would have to file required disclosures with State insurance departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.357" offset="9966040">They, as I said, might have to meet reserve and capitalization requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.561" offset="9982863">In short, a self-insurer would have to create its own captive insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.834" offset="9999895">And some of the sources that Mr. Turner cited, such as the article by Professor Goetz, allude to precisely that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.650" offset="10023196">That was a concern at the time that ERISA was drafted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.081" offset="10032913">And it's quite clear that that's the sort of thing that Congress was concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.514" offset="10050677">The language of the deemer clause is addressed specifically to that problem, insurance companies, people engaged in the insurance business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.568" offset="10074814">And I should add that there is compelling circumstantial evidence that Congress was concerned with that problem when it wrote the deemer clause... again, as Justice Stevens noted, the very evidence that Mr. Turner has used for a different purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.188" offset="10137299">In the late 1960's and '70's self-insurance was becoming common, but the only judicial authority on the question of what self-insurance amounted to were decisions holding that self-funded plans operated by insurance companies for the benefit of their own employees, while they provided insurance, were not engaged in the insurance business for purposes of statutes imposing premium and related taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.865" offset="10232071">Those plans therefore were exempted from those taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.609" offset="10250983">Now at that time, in the early 1970's, when the original versions of ERISA were drafted and reported at a committee, they all included the savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.154" offset="10281181">None of them included the deemer clause, which is not surprising, because there would have been no reason to think the deemer clause was necessary to protect plans from those types of laws, given the existing authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.771" offset="10319633">In 1973, while ERISA was under consideration, the first State court decision going the other way was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.768" offset="10343666">It was the Monsanto case alluded to by Mr. Turner in which a State court in Missouri held that a self-insured plan, operated by an employer not an insurance company, was engaged in the insurance business for purposes of Missouri law and therefore had to obtain a certificate of authority from the State insurance department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.601" offset="10410957">The effect of that decision was to put the self-insurer out of existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.974" offset="10424437">The deemer clause suddenly appeared in the House version of ERISA later that year without explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.516" offset="10446693">Now, the timing certainly suggests that the deemer clause was directed at that type of State legislation which would put self-insurers out of existence and require all ERISA plans to comply with those types of business regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.377" offset="10494131">And there is more compelling evidence in the evolution of the statute that's what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.893" offset="10516179">At the time the deemer clause was written, the basic preemption clause was quite narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.778" offset="10535718">It addressed only fiduciary obligations, notice and disclosure requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.822" offset="10551914">The deemer clause couldn't have been expected to preempt more than the preemption clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.178" offset="10581276">And, therefore, at the time it was put in the statute, its language could have been thought to preempt only those kinds of State laws, the State laws addressed at fiduciary obligations purporting disclosure, the same types of general laws that are involved in State business regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2839.278" offset="11485739">Although it obviously has an effect on insurance contracts, that can't be enough given the language that Congress chose for it to regulate insurance contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.353" offset="11513952">And in any event, as I was suggesting, I think that Congress has in mind particular kinds of State insurance regulations... those that are directed at the business aspects of insurance, which I think is supported both by the activity that led up to the creation of the deemer clause and is supported by the only specific piece of legislative history which addresses how it is Congress wanted the entire package of preemption provisions to operate which is explanation by Representative Dent, who was the floor manager and principal sponsor for ERISA in the House and a member of the committee that wrote the deemer clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.094" offset="11641011">He explained that the deemer clause... that they preemption provisions were modeled on another Federal statute which preempted regulation of health maintenance organizations or HMO's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.033" offset="11684688">That statute was directed only at the organization and operation of HMO's and in particular it preempted State capitalization and reserve requirements as applied to HMO's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.410" offset="11726275">But it didn't regulate the relationship between HMO's and their participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.633" offset="11739127">And I think that's the line Congress intended to draw in the deemer clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.066" offset="11752815">And as I suggested before, that's the only line Congress rationally could have been trying to draw.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.330" offset="11769952">There is no explanation in the policies of ERISA as to why Congress possibly wanted... would have wanted to apply different preemption rules to self-insured and to fully insured plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.457" offset="11806419">It would create irrational distinctions from the same point of the plan participant, who is after all the intended beneficiary of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.875" offset="11840064">It makes no difference whether the employer self-insures or purchases insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.329" offset="11865873">In either case, he's going to get the same benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.859" offset="11879979">And yet petitioner would distinguish on that completely fortuitous basis in deciding who gets the protections of State health law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.285" offset="11901713">Their reading also would create irrational distinction even within plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.386" offset="11914148">Most self-insurers enter into what are called stop-loss agreements with insurance companies in which the insurance carriers agree to pay individual claims that exceed a certain amount or to pay all claims once the plan pay-out reaches a certain point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2970.063" offset="12008815">Well, I think to finish with that point, petitioner's reading would mean that whether or not any particular plan was covered by State law would turn on whether or not the plan had reached the stop-loss point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.315" offset="12073808">It would mean that whether an individual claim was governed by State law, it would turn on whether that claim was submitted before or after the stop-loss point had been reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.280" offset="12105677">And since insurance carriers concededly are covered by this Court... are covered by State law under this Court's decisions, it's impossible to imagine why Congress would have wanted to draw that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.017" offset="12144652">Petitioner seems to suggest in its reply brief that the answer for this problem is simply to preempt State law as it applies to insurance companies that have entered into stop-loss agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.395" offset="12178193">But that is completely without support in the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.349" offset="12190001">The deemer clause says that ERISA plans can't be deemed to be insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.612" offset="12207032">It doesn't say that insurance companies must be deemed to be ERISA plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.204" offset="12221452">And finally, the rule contended for by Petitioner is simply inconsistent with ERISA's basic policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.870" offset="12256038">The statute was enacted... its purposes are expressed in the statutory text... to expand the protections of plan participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.234" offset="12281534">But ERISA itself does not impose substantive requirements on welfare benefit plans of the sort involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.708" offset="12303372">Petitioner's reading would sweep aside all the benefits... all the protections of State law without putting anything in its place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.143" offset="12329181">And again, it is very difficult to imagine why Congress would have intended that result from a statute enacted for the express purpose of protecting participants and plans.</text>

            <text syncTime="3121.463" offset="12614438">The deemer clause doesn't refer to the self-insured or to fully insured plans.</text>

            <text syncTime="3134.803" offset="12667832">So, they are saying that Congress, by use of the word plan which is defined separately to mean everything, meant to distinguish between self-insured and fully insured plans.</text>

            <text syncTime="3261.925" offset="13176280">--Well, there's no explanation whatsoever anywhere as to what Congress could have had in mind, and it's sort of difficult to imagine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.532" offset="13206686">I think that a self-contained plan which is directed specifically at death benefits, it may have thought that that was less likely to be a... a large intrusion on self-insurers and less likely to drive self-insurers out of existence all together, a problem of more general State health and medical insurance regulations as applied to self-insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.555" offset="13290801">I would hypothesize that, but again there is no clear evidence of what Congress was thinking when it wrote that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Rothfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="3299.411" offset="13326223">One... one final point that if the court... if the Federal courts ever were forced into the position of developing a Federal common law, by far the most sensible thing for them to do would simply be to borrow State rules of decisions, which is something that is done in other analogous areas, but that of course would make the entire strained exercise of finding preemption entirely unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.415" offset="13410232">But there is, fortunately, no need to do that because there is no evidence whatsoever anywhere that Congress had the intent to create the broad preemption contended for by petitioner and the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.904" offset="13452237">Mr. Turner alluded to the breadth of the preemption provision, but this case concededly falls within the savings exception and, therefore, all the comments about the breadth of the preemption provision simple fall out of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.970" offset="13496437">Here the focus must be the language and purpose of the deemer clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.273" offset="13509707">Petitioner and the Solicitor General say that that clause was designed to create a sweeping preemption in areas historically committed to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.840" offset="13543979">They say Congress did that using what is clearly language that has a certain opacity to it, that Congress did it without a word of explanation or debate anywhere in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.827" offset="13583895">Now, that clearly is implausible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.729" offset="13591522">Their reading would create all sorts of irrational distinctions between plans, between plan participants, even within plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.661" offset="13615241">It is quite clearly inconsistent with the basic purposes for which ERISA was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.315" offset="13633841">There's no reason to imagine that Congress had that in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.537" offset="13642722">And it does not even have the virtue of simplicity, because it would require the Federal courts generally and, Justice Stevens, this Court in particular to step into the role of creating a general Federal common law of insurance, which would invite litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.556" offset="13690788">There is no reason for the Court to strain to find preemption in those circumstances as it would have to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.701" offset="13711372">Therefore, the judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.322" offset="13721926">If there are no further questions--</text>
