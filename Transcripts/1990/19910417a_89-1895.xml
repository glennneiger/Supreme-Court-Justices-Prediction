            <text syncTime="54.307" offset="345697">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="56.828" offset="355832">The issue before the Court this morning is whether an unreviewed state administrative agency finding of no probable cause dismissing an age discrimination claim bars the subsequent claim under the ADEA in Federal court under this Court's decision in University of Tennessee v. Elliott.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.562" offset="438797">We submit that this Court should fashion a rule of preclusion under the ADEA because nothing in the legislative history of the ADEA or on the face of the statute would dictate otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.020" offset="480593">The ADEA can be interpreted consistent with preclusion and to effectuate Congress' stated purpose in eliminating age discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.875" offset="519986">The pertinent facts before the Court are undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.077" offset="532838">Mr. Solimino was employed by Astoria Federal and terminated in March of 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.191" offset="553318">A charge of discrimination was filed with the EEOC in March, on or about March 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.664" offset="579127">It was referred to the New York State Division of Human Rights for processing, a factfinding conference was held later that year, and on January 25, 1983, approximately 10 months later, a determination was issued finding no probable cause and dismissing his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.834" offset="639836">He took an appeal to the agency's appeal board, and in May of 1984 it sustained the dismissal of the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.481" offset="670451">A lawsuit subsequently followed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.734" offset="691454">A motion for summary judgment later was made by Astoria Federal on two bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.655" offset="711098">One was that the claim was time-barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.626" offset="719039">The other was that it was barred by the doctrine of administrative preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.038" offset="732623">The motion was granted only on that second basis, and the complaint was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.452" offset="754356">An appeal followed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals which reversed, finding under Elliott that there was no basis for a rule of preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.970" offset="788420">We submit that the Court should reverse that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.092" offset="800854">This Court frequently has fashioned common law rules of preclusion in the absence of statutory language directing that such rules not be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.166" offset="837217">In his brief Respondent does not dispute that the doctrine of common law preclusion is sufficiently established in the Federal common law, and himself refers to it as a presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.013" offset="876609">In Elliott, with respect to Title VII, the Court defined the applicable test by stating the question actually before us is whether a common law rule of preclusion would be consistent with congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.282" offset="925615">It was found not to be consistent with congressional intent in Title VII for two reasons, both of which are absent from the ADEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.725" offset="955395">First was that a substantial weight clause had been added in 1972 to Title VII which explicitly stated how much weight should be given to a finding by a state agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.553" offset="1002729">Before the EEOC was free to give more weight or less weight or no weight, but now a maximum had been set.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.587" offset="1030836">The second was this Court's decision in Chandler, which again was based substantially upon the 1972 amendments to Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.834" offset="1059885">Both of those are absent from the ADEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.496" offset="1070543">In Elliott this Court went on to state that a claim under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983, the Post-Civil War Act, was barred by an administrative finding, that preclusion was appropriate because there was nothing in the statute or its legislative history to indicate otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.570" offset="1154761">The Court cited Allen for the proposition supporting that administrative preclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="522.851" offset="2219930">But there is no other indication, as had been in Title VII, that there should be a maximum for the state's administrative finding to be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.517" offset="2254621">Administrative preclusion would achieve certain very significant goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.203" offset="2289311">One would be to avoid relitigation of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.205" offset="2301328">It would avoid the parties being twice faced with exhaustive proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.771" offset="2323584">In this case the proceeding before the state lasted well over a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.390" offset="2338108">In the discussions with regard to Section 14(a) of the clause added regarding supersedure of state actions, was added for the specific purpose of avoiding a multiplicity of actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.101" offset="2392965">That was one of the few congressional expressions of its intent with respect to what should happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.164" offset="2421178">This Court increasingly has required specific proof of congressional intent to overcome various presumptions, whether it was the extraterritoriality presumption in the Aramco case or whether it was the presumption regarding concurrent state and Federal jurisdiction in Yellow Freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.761" offset="2511561">It has required that the party asserting a presumption shouldn't apply to come forward with rather specific evidence of congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.054" offset="2540714">There is none in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.007" offset="2548551">With respect to Section 14(a), for example, of the ADEA, it merely states that nothing in the ADEA should effect the jurisdiction of any agency of any state performing like functions to the EEOC, except that upon commencement of an action under the ADEA, such action shall supersede the state action.</text>

            <text syncTime="672.341" offset="2817925">I may have overstated it, but the Court in Utah Mining and in Elliott has gone forward in the absence of congressional language to the contrary to apply a rule of preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.587" offset="2854915">And that rule should be applied in this case as well because of the lack of congressional language to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.561" offset="2878738">With respect further to Section 14(a), they speak about the performance of like functions and use performing, again seeming to indicate a present tense, as in the same manner that an action now newly instituted under the ADEA would replace another action.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.163" offset="2949165">This is consistent with the legislative objective avoiding multiple lawsuits, and is further consistent with Senator Javits' comment that the act included a proviso guarding against preemption of state proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.789" offset="2999633">With respect to Section 14(b), which also has been cited in opposition to our position, which provides that no suit may be brought under the ADEA before expiration of the 60-day period following referral unless such proceedings have been earlier terminated, it does not define the word terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.423" offset="3082180">But moreover, it doesn't state how termination might occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.826" offset="3095868">If termination occurred on the state's behalf because the complainant insisted and directed that I intend to file a lawsuit and hence I would like to explore the possibility of conciliation, the possibility of mediation, but no further, that would appear to be consistent with this Court's ruling in Oscar Mayer, which directed that a complainant file a charge with the state agency even though it was already time-barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.942" offset="3196283">It spoke about the purpose of 14(b) being commencement of a proceeding, not exhaustion or even participation, merely commencement.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.859" offset="3231914">In the Attorney General of New York's brief in this matter it was stated that it would not, it would appear to be consistent with the purposes of the ADEA for the state agency to terminate upon instruction from the complainant to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.688" offset="3287294">Moreover, that termination within the scope of Commercial Office Products could very well be a termination that was more of a suspension that would allow the ADEA proceeding to commence, to conclude, and then the state might at that point reinstate its proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.607" offset="3354898">The termination need not be a final one.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.828" offset="3363780">And under New York's proceedings it certainly could have resulted from administrative convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.633" offset="3383006">It could have resulted from the lack of cooperation.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.324" offset="3393769">It could have resulted from any number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.385" offset="3402023">But the basic purpose, as Oscar Mayer stated, was merely to screen from the courts those type of claims that might be settled to the grievant's satisfaction on a local level.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.573" offset="3442774">They used settled, they did not use adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.244" offset="3453537">Finally, it would also be an affirmative defense to be raised by an employer, which might or might not be upheld depending on whether it was timely raised and whether sufficient due process had been afforded to make collateral estoppel a bonafide defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.544" offset="3514663">It has also been asserted that the ADEA was enacted in the first place due to dissatisfaction with the state laws then existing.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.200" offset="3549354">That's a very great overstatement of the congressional record.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.212" offset="3561370">If there was dissatisfaction at all, it was in the states that did not yet have state age laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.685" offset="3583209">New York had one.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.915" offset="3588224">In fact it was regularly discussed and cited in Kremer approvingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.598" offset="3602957">Senator Javits, who was then the New York Attorney, had been the New York Attorney General and was a major proponent of the ADEA, referred to the New York law during testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.105" offset="3648933">So I don't think that there's any dissatisfaction, certainly with the New York law.</text>

            <text syncTime="952.644" offset="3939101">The Department of Labor was selected instead of the EEOC in the first instance to move Federal claims, once asserted, along quickly.</text>

            <text syncTime="1063.956" offset="4384332">It has also been asserted that somehow the ADEA should be interpreted in the same manner as Title VII, the procedural dissimilarities in effect to be ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.813" offset="4423725">As this Court stated in Lorillard v. Pons when finding that a jury trial was appropriate under the ADEA, they talked about while there might be substantive similarities, the procedural schemes were very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.609" offset="4466983">Since they were so different it would be unavailing, in the Court's word, to use Title VII to interpret the ADEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.485" offset="4494464">Moreover, Senator Javits in the legislative history specifically called for these laws to be enforced independently of each other, and had, Congress had rejected an ADEA format based upon Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.494" offset="4550471">Pre-suit filing periods are different, the statutes are so different that utilizing Title VII to interpret the ADEA in this particular instance would be very inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.060" offset="4588714">There also was asserted that there is a lack of control over which agency might handle your charge, and as a consequence that might be unfair to a claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.526" offset="4626644">That argument misses the mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.978" offset="4636466">It misses it for a few reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.387" offset="4642108">While you might as a claimant be required to spend 60 days before a state administrative agency, concurrently the EEOC also could be processing your charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.193" offset="4677321">In that instance the Court found in Oscar Mayer that there might be the benefit of two consecutive, two concurrent rather than consecutive efforts to conciliate and mediate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.982" offset="4720476">You might work out a settlement, the courts wouldn't be burdened with further litigation, nor would the state agency, because the effect of the ADEA would have been achieved, which was a nonjudicial settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.157" offset="4769168">Moreover, the Attorney General notes, as I have stated before, that very likely the claimant, if asking to now leave the agency, would be granted a termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.216" offset="4813367">New York State's Division of Human Rights from the outset notes conciliation is the preferred manner of reconciliation; if you would like to explore this, please so state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.032" offset="4848685">That happens at the very beginning of each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.893" offset="4856103">That could be further emphasized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.783" offset="4863627">It has also been asserted that it would be unfair to laypersons to somehow make this a trap for the unwary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.950" offset="4896332">And again that's inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.111" offset="4905005">It's inappropriate because first of all this Court has stated that everyone who makes a claim under a Federal discrimination law is bound to read and understand what they have stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.537" offset="4942621">The Court so stated that in Mohasco, where the complex filing requirements of Title VII, with the initial 60-day exclusive period for the state, and then the 240-day EEOC period and how they might interact were explained and a grievant was charged with that understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.427" offset="5002180">But what's more, in Kremer, certainly the appellant who had appealed before the New York State courts and been unsuccessful did not expect that his later claim in Federal court under Title VII would be barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.325" offset="5049827">However, after that the notice of dismissal of the state, it's in our Joint Appendix at page 95, specifically states that an adverse finding may very well bar you and in effect it warns please think twice before doing this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1396.422" offset="5714174">As the Court stated in Stillians, if you instead went on to get a dismissal first, in effect you have elected your remedy, or as they described it you have made your bed and you are then compelled to lie in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1552.158" offset="6337142">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.052" offset="6368698">While petitioner's argument relies on what is missing from the ADEA, respondent can point to a bounty of evidence of congressional intent from the text of the ADEA, its legislative history, the principles of common sense and public policy considerations, all of which overcome any so-called presumption in the Federal common law of administrative agency preclusion applying to suits under the ADEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.106" offset="6460962">I'd like to use my time before you to enumerate some of those salient pieces of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.230" offset="6477471">First, Section 14(b) of ADEA provides that in the event a state agency terminates its proceedings sooner than in the minimum 60-day period allotted, the grievant can still commence his Federal action, and in fact he can do it that much sooner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.400" offset="6542151">Terminated cases, that typically fall in the category of being quick open-and-shut type cases, are obviously ones in which the grievant has little or no evidence to support his claims, and they would be summarily rejected and terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.419" offset="6602232">It would be ironic indeed if Congress intended to permit quick Federal court access for the least worthy cases in which there is no evidence of discrimination, while at the same time barring court access to the more meritorious cases which, because they are meritorious, happen to have warranted more processing time from the state agency, but unfortunately end up with an adverse decision to the grievant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1644.407" offset="6706095">I think his explanation for that is the that the only thing that Congress expects you to be waiting for is mediation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.570" offset="6730755">And the state proceedings may be terminated very quickly in the frivolous cases, because the employer is going to say, you know, mediate what?</text>

            <text syncTime="1665.290" offset="6789687">--The point that the petitioner made in his brief was that the only kind of cases in which there would be a quick termination would be those in which the state agency abandoned the processing for some reason or the grievant just looking around decided that his case is not worth pursuing in this forum and he took some kind of voluntary dismissal, assuming the state procedures allowed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.338" offset="6881847">I am suggesting that that's a very narrow fact pattern, because the statute doesn't say terminated only if there has been an abandonment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2107.839" offset="8559849">The reason for having instant supersedure in the ADEA is to reaffirm, as I see it, the principles of Federal preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.744" offset="8587538">That in turn means avoiding potentially inconsistent rulings by having the state proceedings extinguished upon the commencement of a Federal suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.000" offset="8624528">If the commencement of a Federal suit can abruptly halt a pending proceeding, it violates those principles of Federal preemption if the opposite result occurs in the case of a completed state agency proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.679" offset="8863183">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.799" offset="8863078">The whole point of Federal preemption is to avoid or prevent inconsistent results.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.071" offset="8862974">Federal preemption should not depend upon whether the state agency proceedings have gone one level or a further level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.907" offset="8862869">The only reason that petitioner submits for carving out an exception to the Federal preemption rules might be to avoid giving, as we have said before, the grievant two bites of the apple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.364" offset="8862765">This competing consideration is based on notions of judicial economy and repose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.478" offset="8862660">Ironically, it would not accomplish the goal intended, because under most state agency forums the grievant, as I said, can wait until the eleventh hour and fifty-ninth minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.644" offset="8862556">He can use the state agency for dress rehearsal purposes, and as the Stillians Court notes, test his case and practice his presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.328" offset="8865795">Because instant judicial supersedure allows it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.210" offset="8877393">He can cut off his case just at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.382" offset="8890036">He would get two bites of the apple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.194" offset="8897246">And the whole reason for having judicial economy and repose, it wouldn't be served anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="2280.553" offset="9250735">When the EEOC filing takes place, that agency, as we have discussed earlier, cannot adjudicate the claims and make factfindings in the traditional sense, as at least as it can do under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.472" offset="9302353">In denying EEOC, factfinding power to the EEOC, Congress obviously eliminated the possibility that the EEOC's findings would have preclusive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.249" offset="9345507">What can be gleaned from the statute that it intended for the state agencies findings, was any greater judicial impact intended for them?</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.595" offset="9378944">Let's look at the landscape of, against which the ADEA is, has been adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.968" offset="9404335">Some state agencies, some states, as the Court well knows, do not even have discrimination statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.722" offset="9427427">Some state agencies have discrimination statutes but they don't adjudicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.334" offset="9441847">Some agencies do adjudicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.665" offset="9451147">Some of the state agencies which do adjudicate, like the New York State Division of Human Rights, give an employer, but not the employee, two bites of the apple at the administrative stage in the sense that there is that first nonhearing level in which only the worst cases get screened out against the employee, but the employer, he gets the public hearing if there is a preliminary finding against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.083" offset="9548845">If state agency preclusion were to apply, some very strange results would occur indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.457" offset="9574340">The grievant who went to the state agency only as a jurisdictional prerequisite to Federal court action would find he never gets Federal court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.861" offset="9603911">The state agency, presumably having less expertise than the Federal agency, would become the dominant agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="2398.650" offset="9723134">Congress did manifest its intent with reasonable clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.713" offset="9739329">It provided that in the case of a state agency filing there is only 60 days for that processing period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.768" offset="9771617">And it also provided that in that 60-day period there would be concurrent, and not sequential, processing by the EEOC, not to mention the doctrine of instant judicial supersedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.055" offset="9808711">This suggests Congress had a twin purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.356" offset="9817906">Number one, it wanted to give grievants easier, not a more difficult, access to the Federal court than exists under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.992" offset="9852492">And two, it wanted correspondingly reduced reliance on the importance of the state agency's processing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.146" offset="9877151">State agency preclusion would subvert this twin purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.888" offset="9892094">Agency preclusion would take away all the considerable substantive benefits of ADEA litigation, jury trial, liquidated damages, attorneys' fees, front pay, and I say without hesitation a more sophisticated Federal judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.277" offset="9941622">It is doubtful that Congress wanted all these virtues of a Federal action to be so readily lost through the happenstance of state agency preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.281" offset="9973596">If uniformity and consistency under the law is a worthwhile objective, the law in this area would become a veritable patchwork quilt if state agency preclusion were to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.928" offset="10016227">The separate laws of 50 states could effectively determine which, whether a grievant gets to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.703" offset="10035349">Title VII and ADEA would be treated differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.374" offset="10046007">The principles of Alexander and Gardner-Denver favoring a judicial forum would be undermined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.657" offset="10067114">The bright line of Kremer limiting preclusion to only cases where the state, where there has been actual state court review, would be lost.</text>

            <text syncTime="2633.906" offset="10664169">That, this Court has never so ruled, and the decision of this Court in the University of Tennessee v.

            <text syncTime="2701.359" offset="10933961">Now, in Elliott the Court reasoned by inference from, largely from a provision that said nothing about the weight that courts give to state agency findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.066" offset="10976802">The substantial weight provision that the Court relied on in part in Elliott addressed itself to the weight that the EEOC would give to state administrative findings, and it reasoned that it made no sense for courts to give preclusive effect if the EEOC did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.499" offset="11046497">In the Government's view the answer to this case is found in a few specific features of the age act, features that simply cannot be squared with giving preclusive effect to state administrative findings in a subsequent Federal action under the age act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.409" offset="11114102">First, as my colleague has said, there is Section 14(b) of the age act, the so-called deferral provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.094" offset="11144926">This section provides for a delay in the filing of the civil action until a state agency has had at least 60 days to consider the complaint of discrimination, unless the state proceedings are earlier terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.141" offset="11193096">Now, since employees who are satisfied with the outcome of state proceedings generally don't go to Federal court, 14(b) clearly contemplates a civil action following an unfavorable state agency decision, including a finding of no discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.032" offset="11256626">And to answer a point that has come up in this argument, Congress clearly contemplated that there would be time when the state would be able to make findings of fact and issue a no probable cause determination within that 60-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.391" offset="11318066">And on page 20 of our brief we cite to a citation in this Court's decision in Oscar Mayer to remarks of Senator Dirksen during the passage of the age act where he said yes, there are many occasions in which 60 days is going to be enough for a dispensation of these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.315" offset="11397791">But if the state's factfinding is binding on the Federal court, a civil action under such circumstances would be pointless.</text>

            <text syncTime="2861.654" offset="11575111">We're saying that there's going to be a significant subset of cases in which it would be pointless, and those are the very cases in which the complainant most needs another look at his, and most deserves another look at his claim, namely where there has been an adverse decision that is on the merits with a no probable cause determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.060" offset="11672704">It might be that there would be a resolution based on procedural defects.</text>

            <text syncTime="2897.018" offset="11716590">But in that case, of course, he'd still be required to prove his case again de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.260" offset="11737592">I mean, the de novo rule favors employees under some circumstances and employers under other circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.657" offset="11767163">Section 7(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.368" offset="11778030">The age act permits simultaneous or successive consideration of a complaint by a state or Federal agency, but as 7(d) reveals, if an individual decides to file with a state agency first, then he must file his complaint with the EEOC within 30 days of a final state agency action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.247" offset="11849501">Therefore the statute clearly contemplates an EEOC investigation and conciliation of a claim on which the state agency has already rendered a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.684" offset="11887222">Now, if that decision had preclusive effect, that would read the EEOC right out of the act, because the EEOC would have nothing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.491" offset="11926510">And let me tell you why.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.142" offset="11933093">If there was a finding of no discrimination by the state agency and a subsequent filing with the EEOC, and the EEOC made its own findings of fact and approached the employer and said, let's sit down and try to solve a problem that we perceive exists with this employee, there is no reason why the employer would even answer his, the phone calls of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.345" offset="12017938">The employer would say, as far as we're concerned, end of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.418" offset="12034239">The state agency has made findings of fact in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.092" offset="12048867">Those findings are binding in a subsequent Federal court action where the grievant has to go to get relief under the age act, and we have no reason to talk to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.090" offset="12096828">So that's why Section 7(d) shows, and the role of the EEOC as contemplated by Section 7(d) shows, that state agency finding cannot have preclusive effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="3032.626" offset="12258996">However, the EEOC has decided to make findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.849" offset="12279894">In practice the EEOC does investigate and make findings, because it has discovered that it's very difficult to solve a discrimination problem and get a conciliation agreement if you don't know what the problem is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.708" offset="12339349">So fact, the practice under the age act and Title VII has converged since 1978 when the authority to enforce the age act was transferred from the Department of Labor to the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.647" offset="12395147">And it is our position that the EEOC's factfinding under the age act is perfectly legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.553" offset="12422732">In fact, it's absolutely necessary to carry out the EEOC's mandate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3085.981" offset="12472469">This Court has never so held, but the lower courts... under the age act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.382" offset="12490023">Under Title VII it has been established in Chandler v. Roudebush and many subsequent cases that EEOC factfinding is not binding, that there is de novo review in a subsequent Federal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.821" offset="12539760">The lower courts have uniformly held that that rule applies under the age act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.535" offset="12562644">No court has held otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.036" offset="12572675">Which brings me to the third point and the third reason why preclusive effect for state agency findings just does not square with the scheme here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.196" offset="12617292">The EEOC's factfinding does not get preclusive effect in a subsequent Federal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.809" offset="12639757">It simply makes no sense, therefore, to give state findings preclusive effect, because the role of the EEOC and the state agency is essentially the same under the age act, and that is to try and resolve problems of discrimination to the satisfaction of the grievant short of a Federal lawsuit, to keep these issues and these conflicts out of court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3166.683" offset="12795238">Our position is that under 803, Federal Rule of Evidence 803(8)(c), which allows the admission into evidence in a Federal civil court, Federal civil action of proceedings and records of Government agencies, that it would be admissible and it could be admitted in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.487" offset="12882487">Now age discrimination actions are tried before a jury, so a jury would be perfectly entitled to evaluate that and evaluate the actual evidence and the answers, and the transcripts as part of the evidence as a whole.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul J. Siegel</label>
            <text syncTime="3212.683" offset="12979245">I believe that our argument covered the points raised, but there was one question with respect to, as it was termed, the background rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.167" offset="13009233">This Court in Elliott, specifically citing Allen and Migra, said nonetheless they support the view that Congress, in enacting the reconstruction of civil rights statutes, did not intend to create an exception to the general rules of preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.847" offset="13063881">So it has been termed a general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.518" offset="13070569">With respect to the EEOC's expertise that has been referred to several times, it kind of strains the imagination to think that an agency that received age discrimination coverage in 1978 somehow has greater expertise than the agency that had it since 1958, the New York State Division of Human Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.009" offset="13140577">And it would not be a nullity to have had the EEOC process this because they might be able to work out a resolution or they might file their own independent proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.886" offset="13180074">So in either event that 7(d) has a life apart from administrative preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.219" offset="13201390">We ask that the Court reverse the Second Circuit's decision, remand this matter back to the Second Circuit with instructions to consider whether sufficient due process was afforded so that collateral estoppel effect be given to the adverse decision of the state division of human rights.</text>
