            <text syncTime="12.930" offset="176232">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="22.325" offset="213848">This case concerns the duty of fair representation this Court has implied from the Railway Labor Act and the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.554" offset="262750">In particular it concerns the end of a long and bitter strike well-chronicled in the press between the Air Line Pilots Association and Continental Airlines and its Chief Executive, Mr. Lorenzo.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.866" offset="335997">The strike began in '83 after... 1983 after Continental went into bankruptcy and abrogated the collective bargaining agreement between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.745" offset="399527">And the events here concern the situation in August, September, and October of 1985.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.273" offset="441636">At that point, the union was faced with the following facts of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.159" offset="473192">One, despite substantial expense and unstinting effort, the union had failed to significantly affect Continental's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.260" offset="537558">Secondly, Continental at that point had 1,600 working pilots, either permanent replacements or crossovers, and there were 1,000 strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.196" offset="581339">Third, Continental, in recognition of that, had withdrawn recognition of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.161" offset="621254">Fourth, Continental had put out what was called its 85-5 vacancy bid which would have tied up all the most desireable jobs in the air line, the captain and first officer jobs, for the foreseeable future.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.106" offset="716967">And finally, insofar as strikers had bid for those jobs, Continental had sued to invalidate those bids as fraudulent.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.176" offset="761270">Against that background, the union, after internal meetings and discussions, authorized the negotiation of the a settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.834" offset="815918">As matters turned out, given the difficulties to only be expected in such a bitter strike and with such a large company, the settlement proceeded under the auspices of the bankruptcy court, which had jurisdiction over Continental at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.022" offset="924692">After very intensive efforts, a long, complex document emerged called the Order and Award which is in the joint appendix.</text>

            <text syncTime="218.445" offset="998358">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.704" offset="999403">It was issued as an order of the bankruptcy court.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.237" offset="1025525">It's undisputed that all but two of its terms were negotiated between the parties, but it was under the auspices of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.752" offset="1059589">Court had attempted as part of the reorganization as far back as July to get the parties to settle this dispute, because it was an obstacle to reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.600" offset="1106923">And finally it was in this October period that the union came forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.535" offset="1130746">The court had also indicated that it wanted, if it was going to put its efforts into it, to have authorized representatives and to have a binding conclusion to the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.214" offset="1181424">And that, too, was very much in the union's interest as the negotiators saw it, because of the grave distrust between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.091" offset="1220921">It was a substantial matter to the union that whatever was concluded would be enforceable, because, as I say, the level of distrust between Mr. Lorenzo and ALPA was substantial at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.873" offset="1300020">In late October this agreement as embodied in the Order and Award was reached, and thereafter this lawsuit followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.033" offset="1360728">The lawsuit was brought by a class of striking pilots alleging that the union, in taking the course that it did, had violated the statutory duty of fair representation.</text>

            <text syncTime="892.163" offset="3693254">As we detail in our brief starting on page 14, the court has used different formulations to delineate the scope of the duty of fair representation, and the court has used the word arbitrary in doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.199" offset="3781339">We believe that the fairest reading of all the cases is that arbitrary in that sense means hostile action against an individual or a subgroup of the bargaining force.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.332" offset="3869842">In other words, the union generally processes grievances by doing certain preliminary steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.539" offset="3902756">An individual shows that without any justification, any reason, the union doesn't do those things for him and he is harmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.884" offset="3952075">We would think that that is arbitrary and that it adds something to the concept of discriminatory, because discrimination, certainly as it was used in Steele, has a notion of a class-based wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.648" offset="4027203">So what we would suggest is that this test is a test of good faith and honesty of purpose as the Court said in Ford Motor and that what arbitrary means is that discrimination, which is either class based or is simply inexplicable and harmful, is a wrong.</text>
