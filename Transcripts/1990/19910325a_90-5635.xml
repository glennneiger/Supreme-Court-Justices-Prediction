            <label>Mr. Christopher D. Cerf</label>
            <text syncTime="82.807" offset="452985">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.505" offset="455806">Now, I don't think, Justice O'Connor, that the fact that there was a waiver of the jury right here is relevant to the argument we make under the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.851" offset="485168">And perhaps I should address that.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.502" offset="495826">We think, as an initial matter, that by far the most natural reading of the statutory language is to construe the phrase</text>
            <text syncTime="99.706" offset="520590">"prisoner petitions challenging conditions of confinement. "</text>
            <text syncTime="103.139" offset="534383">to refer to ongoing circumstances or practices, as distinct from a fully consummated, isolated event.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.074" offset="566148">We think that conforms with common usage, with this Court's use of the phrase, and with the use of the phrase by Congress in various other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.658" offset="596450">Whatever the outer limits of the definition may be, we think it strains the common meaning beyond the breaking point to suggest that a guard, by virtue of beating one prisoner on one occasion, thereby creates conditions of confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.858" offset="657263">But moving to your Seventh Amendment question, Justice O'Connor, in this case respondent has conceded that the magistrate is not empowered to conduct a jury trial at all in cases referred under the prisoner petitions clause, indeed in any case referred without the consent of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.743" offset="736779">At the same time, cases... because of the rules governing the availability of injunctive relief, cases based on a simple, fully consummated episode, tend to be simple damages actions for which the party is entitled to a trial by jury under the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.233" offset="802713">Now, in light of respondent's concession, we think it is just highly unlikely that Congress would have intended to authorize the nonconsensual referral of an entire class of cases for which the jury trial rights so clearly attaches.</text>

            <text syncTime="190.025" offset="881916">And respondent's position on this, of course, is that Congress wrote a statute by which prisoners are told that entirely against their will they may have a case referred for trial before a magistrate, never bothered to mention that they could entirely avoid the reference simply by timely invocation of a jury trial right.</text>

            <text syncTime="222.987" offset="1013782">Chief Justice Rehnquist, I would question that that was how Congress wanted it to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.221" offset="1030709">I think that Congress chose the phrase "conditions of confinement" for a reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.033" offset="1049935">It didn't say, all prisoner petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.775" offset="1060907">It's... it used what amounts to a term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.007" offset="1073864">Now, what respondents are trying to sell here is the notion that all prisoner cases are governed under the case, and we... are governed under the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.063" offset="1102076">And we think that's unlikely in light of the backgrounds and with amendment concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.664" offset="1116495">Again, Mr. Chief Justice, we are not asserting an independent Seventh Amendment claim here.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.968" offset="1133632">What we are suggesting is that, as an interpretive device, the Seventh Amendment is quite useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.140" offset="1158396">And we think that the appropriate test here is that to the extent that a complaint, not at the time that a complaint is filed, but at the time that the case is actually set for trial, seeks and is appropriate for injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.498" offset="1211790">In other words, it challenges an ongoing or recurrent circumstance or practice that in fact is a petition challenging conditions of confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.618" offset="1256303">If, on the other hand, the only complaint at the time that the case gets to the point of trial is that an isolated event occurred, essentially a constitutional tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.044" offset="1301965">I don't think that does qualify under the language.</text>

            <text syncTime="340.834" offset="1485135">And again, we think that that is a rather unlikely thing for it to have done, given that magistrates, as all parties before the court now concede, take the position that magistrates are not empowered to conduct a jury trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="385.122" offset="1662246">I... I don't think it could be said that as a class, cases that qualify as conditions cases are more serious than cases based on a single, isolated episode.</text>

            <text syncTime="401.344" offset="1727134">But to suggest that a claim in which a prisoner was beaten to death is somehow less serious than even a broad based class action seems to me not to be... not surprising.</text>

            <text syncTime="419.994" offset="1801739">It seems to me that if you were going to allot these cases by the confidence in the judgment... presumably you have more confidence in the judgment of a district judge than of a magistrate... you would say that if you're trying to restructure a court... a prison system, that kind of a case you'd trust to the discretion of a district judge, whereas you might not trust it to the discretion of a magistrate.</text>

            <text syncTime="450.907" offset="1925455">And in addition, Congress authorized the referral of all cases, including those based on specific episodes of misconduct under pretrial and the dispositive motions provisions of the act.</text>

Rodriguez, this Court talked about the term "conditions of confinement" and gave some examples there that looked very much like this kind of case, and said that was a matter of a condition of confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.330" offset="2735147">And I suppose that Congress had in mind trying to alleviate the administrative... or the burdens on the lower courts of handling prisoner petitions and letting as many of them go to a magistrate as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.752" offset="2800766">And it would appear that under Preiser we could give a broader interpretation of the term "conditions of confinement".</text>

            <text syncTime="678.757" offset="2836815">Let me try to address both of those points, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.520" offset="2851862">As to Preiser, there's certainly no evidence in the legislative history that Congress was even aware of the Preiser case, much less that it patterned the statute after it.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.786" offset="2884985">Much less, as I recall in the case, what was at issue there was whether a prisoner who was challenging the deprivation of good time credits could escape the exhaustion requirements of habeas by filing the suit under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.533" offset="2935976">And Congress... and the Court held that to the extent the challenge was to the fact or duration of confinement, exhaustion was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.309" offset="2967010">To the extent it went to conditions of confinement, habeas... one could bring the claim under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.832" offset="2989161">But because the case so clearly fell in the first category, the court had no occasion to actually define what it meant by conditions of confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.216" offset="3018628">And indeed it the Court goes back and reviews the cases cited as examples in the Preiser decision of so-called conditions case, I think it will find that all of them, at least arguably, fall within the definition that we propose here.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.027" offset="3073903">In one sense or another, they concerned an ongoing circumstance or practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.280" offset="3094905">The most difficult case for us is the Hainey case.</text>

            <text syncTime="839.151" offset="3478383">And I don't think that that is controlling as to whether or not it's a conditions case, because at the time that this case went to trial as a result of the various pretrial proceedings, which again are conducted by the magistrate, it was absolutely clear that there was no injunctive claim left in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.532" offset="3547973">Indeed, the assistant attorney general had argued unequivocally on pretrial motions that, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="861.897" offset="3569393">"It does not appear how any injunctive relief would be appropriate to this case. "</text>
            <text syncTime="865.030" offset="3581932">There have been an effort to admit the various prison regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="878.697" offset="3636580">So, again, just to make sure our position is clear on this, Justice Kennedy, it's not the allegations in the complaint that are controlling.</text>

            <text syncTime="1709.671" offset="6960505">In Preiser the Court decided... this Court decided that there was a clear dichotomy between habeas cases on the one hand where there was a challenge to the fact or duration of confinement and those cases, on the other hand, where there was a challenge to conditions of confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.541" offset="7023930">And the Court did cite, not only Haines v. Kerner, which was a case involving solitary confinement and a claim for damages arising out of solitary confinement, but also the Wilberly case, which was a challenge to prison clothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.111" offset="7082236">So the Court clearly had in mind that broad distinction and so did Congress, because that was the kind of distinction that would serve its aim of broadening discretion, broadening the discretion of Congress to... of the court to refer to magistrates.</text>

            <text syncTime="2151.402" offset="8727428">This is a case I think that illustrates very dramatically the difficulty of drawing this distinction between a single episode on one hand and a continuing condition on the other, a claim for damages which was involved, and a claim for injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.127" offset="8810288">But it also illustrates well the fact that there is a process difficulty with drawing that distinction, which is that anywhere along the line, sui sponte at the court of appeals level, as happened in Clark v.

            <text syncTime="2389.106" offset="9678180">And of course, the opinion of Judge Neumann for the Second Circuit below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.091" offset="9706184">We contend that our distinction, which is drawn clearly, naturally, logically... the distinction adopted by the Second Circuit is one that serves the best... the true goals of Congress in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.823" offset="9777132">A goal that has been endorsed and articulated by this Court in United States v. Raddatz, which involved the question of whether a motion for suppression hearing could be referred to a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.150" offset="9830422">The Court concluded that it could, that there did not have to be a new hearing before the district judge, and that is was the district judge who should have discretion under the statute, because that fit the structure of the statute, the purpose of Congress to broaden the authority of magistrates, to ease the workload of the district judges, consistent with Seventh Amendment rights, because the prisoners could continue to demand a jury trial and do often.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.573" offset="9956123">But that discretion on the part of the district judge would exist whenever and wherever there were no timely jury demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.259" offset="9994889">I would just conclude by citing for this Court also the dissent that is contained in the Clark v. Poulton case when Judge Anderson, which I think strikingly illustrates the incongruity or anomaly... to use two words that have been used today... of the petitioner's approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.683" offset="10076495">A single beating case would have to go to a district judge, but a case alleging daily beating of prisoners would go inexorably to a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.939" offset="10129576">That cannot be in the interest of anyone, not the judiciary, not the public, not even perhaps of prisoners, because let's remember that cases would have to be referred if they involved a single episode claim for damages, under petitioner's theory, even where the prisoner himself or herself might want to be heard by the magistrate at the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.620" offset="10236260">It's very unlikely that the district judges would go out to the prison, but there would be great advantages, and were in this case, to having cases of this type heard at the prison where evidence would be accessible, documents would be there, and the difficulties of going to court and having that same accessibility would be avoided.</text>

            <text syncTime="2608.159" offset="10554432">A petition challenging something really does call to mind a request for declaratory or injunctive relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2624.100" offset="10618170">Well, the Second Circuit concluded, and of course we agree, that what Congress had in mind was the language of Preiser even though Preiser is not cited in the legislative history, and perhaps it had not yet become a term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.830" offset="10669161">But conditions of confinement, in the context of prison life, in the context of being confined, very arguably extends to anything that happens while that person is subject to the guard and care of the confining official.</text>

            <text syncTime="2706.266" offset="10946895">But it would have been highly unlikely that Congress would have meant to circumscribe and cut out an entire class of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.898" offset="10985348">And indeed, petitioner concedes that the fit is not perfect without very clearly indicating its intent to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.998" offset="11029756">And the concessions that petitioner makes in footnotes 3 and footnote 9 very considerably eviscerate whatever argument could have been made on the basis of the distinction between equitable relief on the one hand and damages relief on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.128" offset="11098301">The petitioner concedes in those footnotes that ancillary claims for damages, as he refers to them, can be referred to the magistrate when they involve injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.735" offset="11144695">And what is ancillary in one jurist's view may be very different from what it is in another jurist's view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.381" offset="11175310">And in footnote 9 mentions the instance of a single petitioner who was deprived... allegedly deprived of constitutionally satisfactory meals as opposed to pervasive conditions.</text>
