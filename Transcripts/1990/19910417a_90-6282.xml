            <label>Mr. Joel I. Klein</label>
            <text syncTime="10.909" offset="171002">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.471" offset="189288">The statute that we challenge... the temporary scheduling provision of the Controlled Substances Act gives the Attorney General unchecked power to adopt and then to enforce criminal prohibitions against previously lawful behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.830" offset="246653">We think the statute raises two important structural issues concerning Congress' power to delegate criminal rulemaking authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.856" offset="278836">First, may Congress combined in one government official two core separated functions... the power to create a crime and the power to prosecute individual violators?</text>
            <text syncTime="49.534" offset="325543">And second, may Congress bar judicial review of criminal rulemaking determinations, either completely as we read the statute, or at least until after someone is indicted, as the Government reads the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="64.193" offset="384161">Our argument is that neither practice... neither practice, much less both in the same statute is consistent with a government of properly separated powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.148" offset="423972">Now, before addressing each of these issues individually, I'd like to emphasize at the outset how unprecedented this statute truly is.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.054" offset="459603">This Court of course has never approved either practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.068" offset="475694">And that's not surprising, because for all intents and purposes Congress has never adopted these kind of practices in any previous statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.163" offset="507982">So far as we can tell no statute gives the Attorney General or any other official the power to make and enforce a criminal sanction against purely private conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.061" offset="555629">The example that the Government gives... the only example I presume that they were able to find... is regulations controlling prison access.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.346" offset="588752">But we think that's so entirely distinguishable, because the Government there and the Attorney General is responsible for the operation of that building much as any department would be for the operation of its own buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.114" offset="635877">But that's very different from purely private conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="146.566" offset="713618">And the President can tell the Secretary of HHS, no, I don't want it defined this way, I want it defined another way.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.252" offset="740367">Now, that crime would be prosecuted after it's defined by HHS by the Attorney General.</text>

            <text syncTime="168.931" offset="803061">First of all, in both instances, that is first as you say the President has to tell them... the HHS Secretary... how he wants the crime defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.728" offset="834303">Now, in that regard the HHS Secretary doesn't have to follow the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.779" offset="850499">And if he doesn't in that respect, of course he's removable by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="976.039" offset="4031482">But the Government agrees that this statute says there could be no pre-enforcement review.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.733" offset="4054261">In other words, the Attorney General can take any drug and he can make it a crime... or the DEA administrator... for 18 months, during which period... no matter whether that appears to be arbitrary, inconsistent with the intelligible principle that Congress set down or what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.266" offset="4128449">During that 18 month period, no citizen can seek judicial review unless he's willing to first of all violate the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.583" offset="4165752">Second of all, subject himself to investigation and prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.743" offset="4182366">And then third of all, take the risk that if his challenge turns out not to be correct, he can be convicted for 10 or more years for having violated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.620" offset="4217892">Now, we think that is a phenomenal amount of power in and of itself, even if you couldn't back it up with the enforcement power that the Attorney General can.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.477" offset="4257285">Let me give you an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.425" offset="4261046">Suppose we had a reg at the Department of Transportation, and that reg said that the Secretary could determine for a period of 18 months which cars are unsafe and that should be done in accordance with the kind of criteria here, dangerous to the public and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.679" offset="4326143">And if that statute said, for 18 months nobody could judicially challenge it except after prosecution, I think we would see clearly that that is a tremendous amount of power that's unwarranted, that shouldn't be granted, and that the fundamental structural check of judicial review should be preserved here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1430.025" offset="5847515">And we don't think the words bear that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1451.300" offset="5932570">And we think that relying on subdelegation statutes that go back 10, 15 years before this power was ever contemplated, that reliance on that is really unwarranted here, that a contemporary expression with this kind of power of the authority to subdelegate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.880" offset="5998921">After all, a subdelegation clause provides the power to give this to any, quote, "employee" of the Justice Department.</text>

            <text syncTime="1557.362" offset="6356798">I'd like to begin with clarifying the point that you just discussed with Mr. Klein, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.106" offset="6379786">In fact, this... this activity would be illegal under section 360 for the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, because that requires any manufacturer to register with the FDA before engaging in any manufacture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.112" offset="6431822">So in fact, there would be a violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1580.055" offset="6447600">Well, then if that's true, let me ask you this further question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.036" offset="6455541">Part of the Government's rationale for the whole program is the emergency that the... there must be prompt response to a new drug of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.644" offset="6489918">I'm a little puzzled as to what was the emergency if it was already illegal?</text>

            <text syncTime="1594.004" offset="6503397">Well, part of the problem here... it's perhaps best, Your Honor, to explain exactly how these situations arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.399" offset="6528997">What normally happens is a drug enforcement investigation leads to the seizure of a drug laboratory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.084" offset="6555747">Upon examination of the materials in the drug laboratory, they find that the person is selling particular drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.628" offset="6577899">That person might be selling these drugs as amphetamines or speed or some other drugs that are controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.639" offset="6597961">In fact, a further review reveals that these drugs are in fact a... they mimic the dangerous effects of that drug, that they are not in fact controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.727" offset="6630248">At that point, the DEA makes a determination whether they should seek to further control those drugs, to place them on the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.191" offset="6660132">And at that... in that manner be able to apply the full force of the criminal law against this--</text>

            <text syncTime="1656.495" offset="6753337">That's simply not enough to deter this type of activity, which can be very, very remunerative in terms of the amount of money that can be made on those types of sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.762" offset="6786460">Congress enacted section 201(h) of the Controlled Substances Act to deal with the serious health problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.854" offset="6810806">Illicit drug dealers attempt to avoid laws prohibiting the Controlled Substances Act or to attempt to avoid laws prohibiting the sale of controlled substances by producing and selling drugs such as euphoria involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.345" offset="6864723">It mimics the dangerous effects of a controlled substance, but is not listed as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.629" offset="6881859">Section 201(h) authorizes the Attorney General to take prompt action to protect the public with the dangers associated with the misdirected creativity of these underground chemists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.386" offset="6920939">If the Attorney General finds that the unlisted drug poses an imminent hazard to the public safety, it has no approved medical use, he may list that drug as a schedule 1 controlled substance for as long as 18 months while he completes the permanent listing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.394" offset="6976945">Now, petitioners acknowledge that Congress has authority to protect the public health through some mechanism allowing the executive branch to list eight dangerous drugs on an emergency basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.372" offset="7016860">They argue, however, that Congress' use of the Attorney General to effect that result is an unlawful delegation of legislative power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.776" offset="7046431">Petitioners concede that section 201(h) lays down intelligible principles that guide the Attorney General's exercise of emergency listing discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.722" offset="7082271">That concession, we submit, should resolve the delegation issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.935" offset="7095123">This Court has repeatedly held that Congress does not delegate legislative power as the Constitution uses that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.628" offset="7121872">Or it gives an executive branch official discretion to define unlawful conduct and also lays down guidelines that channel the executive branch officials exercise of that discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.193" offset="7160116">The reason for this is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.985" offset="7167326">Congress can enact laws whose application depends on the satisfaction of certain conditions, and then give the executive branch official the task of determining whether those conditions have been satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.492" offset="7209330">The executive branch official does not in that situation exercise legislative power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.487" offset="7229288">He's not making law subject only to constitutional limits in electoral accountability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.558" offset="7245588">Rather he's executing Congress' will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.099" offset="7255724">The task of determining whether a law should apply to particular facts is simply one aspect of executing that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.653" offset="7281951">Congress must of course give the executive branch intelligible direction to ensure the executive is executing Congress' will rather than exercising de facto legislative power.</text>

            <text syncTime="1860.004" offset="7567417">As this Court has repeatedly emphasized, the Constitution divides government power into three co-equal branches of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.810" offset="7594584">It does not dictate how Congress might assign responsibilities within the executive branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.750" offset="7614333">Rather Congress' broad authority under the necessary and proper clause to select the President or one of his subordinates to perform an executive function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.365" offset="7644844">There's no constitutional requirement that Congress vulcanize the executive branch's regulatory and prosecutory functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.430" offset="7673056">In this instance, Congress gave the Attorney General responsibility for temporarily listing dangerous drugs, because it determined that he's best situated to respond promptly and effectively to the public health threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.238" offset="7712344">Certainly Congress entitled... is entitled to make that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.229" offset="7728331">As I explained before, these enforcement... the listing is usually preceded by enforcement action that leads to the discovery of these drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.186" offset="7760096">Now, Congress' decision to give the Attorney General both regulatory and prosecutive functions is not, as petitioners suggested in their opening brief, entirely unprecedented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.602" offset="7797817">Congress has given the Attorney General criminal enforcement power in all three of the basic areas where the Attorney General has regulatory responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.036" offset="7827492">In the case of controlled substances, the Attorney General plays the principal role in the permanent listing decision... even in the case of drugs that have medical uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.661" offset="7858003">In the case of prisons, the Attorney General has authority to regulate the introduction of anything whatsoever into prison and to punish violations, including violations by people who are not prisoners and not subject to the Attorney General's custodial responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.542" offset="7913592">Now, the Attorney General has exercised that authority since at least 1948, and it has withstood repeated delegation challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.364" offset="7944834">In the case of immigration, it's a crime to bring aliens into this country at locations other than designated ports of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.118" offset="7967822">Now, the Attorney General has authority to designate ports of entry under 8 U.S.C. 1229.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.832" offset="7990705">He has delegated that authority to the Commissioner of the INS.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.675" offset="8006065">What we see here really is that in any case where the Attorney General has regulatory responsibilities, he also has prosecutorial responsibilities as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.600" offset="8037830">Indeed, what is unprecedented in here is petitioners' extraordinary approach to what constitutes an unlawful delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.616" offset="8065833">Under petitioners' view, the question would turn not on the proper relationship between the Congress and the executive branch, but rather on whether a given executive branch official, in this case the Attorney General, is the appropriate person to administer prisons, to determine lawful ports of entry for aliens, or to designate dangerous drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.577" offset="8137722">Petitioners also contend that section 201(h) violates separation of powers, because the section does not provide for judicial review of the Attorney General's temporary listing decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.608" offset="8185788">That argument however is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.628" offset="8193938">Section 507, the Controlled Substances Act, contains special provisions for judicial review which may be invoked upon permanent listing of the substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.083" offset="8227688">Section 201(h)(6) prevents and individual from invoking those provisions until completion of the permanent listing decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.318" offset="8252661">But even then it does not prevent an individual who is prosecuted in the interim from obtaining judicial oversight of the Attorney General's action in the enforcement proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.122" offset="8291845">In this case, petitioners challenged only the constitutionality of section 201(h)--</text>

            <text syncTime="2461.540" offset="9973503">One, petitioners note that there have been suggestions in the executive branch that there should be some division of executive and prosecutive and regulatory powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.569" offset="10021673">We've made those suggestions as a policy matter and not as a constitutional matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.901" offset="10034943">This is a constitutional issue that's posed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.002" offset="10043407">With respect to Gagnon v. Scarpelli, I think the more... the more compelling precedent would be Withrow v. Larkin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.427" offset="10069112">In that case, this Court noted that, as a general matter, there is not facially violative of due process to combine both a prosecutorial and an adjudicative function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.213" offset="10112266">It indicated it might be unconstitutional in certain factual situations and explained cases like Gagnon on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.516" offset="10141419">Here we do not have a combination of the prosecution in adjudicatory function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.652" offset="10162003">Instead, it's simply the regulatory and prosecutive function instead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.403" offset="10176945">Also, I'd like to reemphasize the point that was made in argument that the petitioners' reliance on the Abbott Lab case is really misplaced here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.769" offset="10206411">That was a statutory... in case of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.801" offset="10218532">The due process principles that were applicable in this area were set forth in the Ewing case that was decided before that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.704" offset="10242147">And then finally I think it's... I should mention the subdelegation issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.067" offset="10255626">Petitioners also contend that the Attorney General lacks statutory authority to delegate his section 201 responsibilities to the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="2545.095" offset="10307766">As we explain in our brief, there is no indication in either of those statutes that Congress intended to exempt section 201(h) from subdelegation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joel I. Klein</label>
            <text syncTime="2672.097" offset="10815796">Yes, very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.379" offset="10828857">A couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.182" offset="10836067">First of all, on this issue of whether prior behavior was already criminal, Justice Stevens, to begin with even under the Government's view, if I've registered, which lots of people do, then it is no crime for me to manufacture this drug in my home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.420" offset="10893014">But once the Attorney General passes this regulation, it then becomes a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.254" offset="10916419">So something that was noncriminal is now a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.894" offset="10923002">By the same token, I could possess this drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.987" offset="10935332">There is no requirement there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.799" offset="10942542">And that becomes a crime once it's scheduled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.621" offset="10953827">The second point I want to make is on judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.963" offset="10967201">And the Justice Department says what the statute really refers to is 877, which is the general judicial review statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.669" offset="11002101">That statute only says there shall be judicial review in the courts of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.781" offset="11022477">It doesn't say anything at all about judicial review in district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.933" offset="11039090">So the... the Government's argument doesn't even fit its own theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.797" offset="11058526">In other words, if all that Congress meant to do was take out 877, which the words don't support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.651" offset="11089977">But if that's all that it meant to do, there still could be pre-enforcement actions, injunctive and declaratory, in the district courts, because this statute doesn't mention it and that is a common and typical way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.889" offset="11134908">So I suggest to you that the Government's forcing the words doesn't even go with its theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.362" offset="11156850">Finally, the issue of whether it would be constitutional, Justice Scalia, to eliminate judicial review here altogether seems to me at least the Court has said twice that it would be impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.902" offset="11210976">That is in Skinner v. Mid-America, which is a delegation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.943" offset="11227172">I realize... the terminology is the Court's not mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.025" offset="11239502">In that case, the Court said that a delegation of power was valid so long as, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.839" offset="11262699">"a court could ascertain whether the will of Congress has been obeyed. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.903" offset="11278999">That point was made as well in Chada.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.555" offset="11289552">So I suggest to you if this was a blanket preclusion, that in fact it would not comport with these... with this Court's principles and that's exactly why the Government is trying to fiddle with the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.773" offset="11338454">Thank you.</text>
