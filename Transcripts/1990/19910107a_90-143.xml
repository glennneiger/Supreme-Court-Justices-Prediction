            <text syncTime="1557.906" offset="6358863">Connecticut has a unique prejudgment attachment statute which allows anybody with a colorable claim to attach a defendant's real estate before bringing the lawsuit without giving notice to that defendant until after the attachment has been placed, without any bond to protect the defendant against a wrongful attachment, and without reciting any particular reasons for the attachment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1604.196" offset="6544019">This procedure is so routine in Connecticut that before the Second Circuit decision below it was routinely... there were 300 to 400 real estate attachments per week before lawsuits were even brought.</text>

            <text syncTime="1649.968" offset="6727085">Your... this Court has looked at several factors, and among the factors in deciding whether something was constitutional was in Mitchell, I believe, where the Court emphasized that the plaintiff had to file an affidavit that the property in which he had a security interest was at risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.648" offset="6797825">All we're doing in this case is absence of advance notice and the lack of a bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.912" offset="6818932">Again, the litigation was unrelated to the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.905" offset="6834919">And another peculiarity of Connecticut law is that we have no homestead exemption whatsoever, so that once a person's home is attached, there is no cushion left to the homeowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.541" offset="6877446">Exactly how it works is illustrated by this case, and that is that Mr. DiGiovanni presented a one-sided affidavit to a judge on the papers 2 days after the assault occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.501" offset="6945260">And the affidavit is, as this Court has already noticed, a bare minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.364" offset="6960725">"On March 13 I was willfully, wantonly, and maliciously assaulted. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.048" offset="6983399">"The assault broke my left wrist and further caused an ecchymosis to my right eye, as well as other injuries. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1735.483" offset="7069185">Now the questioning to the attorney general was on the standard for probable cause in Connecticut, and the cases are quite clear that the standard for probable cause is a... that you can assert a colorable position that you have a claim against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.052" offset="7135432">That subjective belief, probable cause, does not have to be more true than false.</text>

            <text syncTime="3002.925" offset="12138925">Your Honors, I think I should respond immediately to the return date question which Justice White had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.069" offset="12163481">We do disagree, as you point out, in our reply brief as to the effect of this return date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.103" offset="12191693">This return date is in all actions and has to do with when one has to appear or face default attachments to one's side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.629" offset="12237773">It could be any case where there is a lawsuit between a plaintiff and a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.532" offset="12253342">The defendant is given, on the papers that he is receiving, an indication of a date, a cut-off date after which an answer must be filed or an appearance must be filed in the State court or he risks having the plaintiff come in and make a motion to default for failure to appear and then take judgment against him if that is granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.220" offset="12352085">But that does not impact on the attachment situation, where if a person is served with an attachment and given notice that he may immediately appear, there is no reason why, indeed there is no legal bar under the rule of court, to have that party go to the clerk's office, present the motion to release the attachment, and have the process started.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.841" offset="12482592">It obviously would have to be put on the calendar, and that would take a week or two, but they're not going to throw his papers out or refuse to honor it, or anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.620" offset="12525747">So the return date is a red herring, in our opinion, in this... in this matter.</text>
