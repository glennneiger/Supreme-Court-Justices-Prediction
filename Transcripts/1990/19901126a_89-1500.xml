            <text syncTime="51.395" offset="336913">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="55.118" offset="351751">This action began as a suit for copyright infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.372" offset="368783">It was filed after the plaintiff below, Business Guides, that it had detected copying of entries in several of its published directories put out by the defendant, Chromatic Communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.168" offset="419983">Unfortunately much of the evidence of defendant's copying turned out to be in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.192" offset="444120">When that became apparent to the district court, judge called a halt to the proceedings and referred the matter to the chief magistrate to determine whether sanctions were appropriate against both Business Guides and its attorneys under Rule 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.283" offset="504411">The magistrate initially concluded that Business Guides and its counsel were guilty of deliberate misrepresentations and recommended not only sanctions, but disciplinary proceedings against plaintiff's attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.964" offset="559163">At that point both the client and its lawyers retained new counsel, who were able to demonstrate in a subsequent hearing to the satisfaction of the chief magistrate that the erroneous filings were in fact a product of error, not any intended desire to mislead the court or misuse the judicial process.</text>

            <text syncTime="136.513" offset="677341">I'm sure he appreciates it.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.545" offset="689462">Nonetheless, while the magistrate explicitly found that neither Business Guides nor its counsel had engaged in any intended misrepresentation or acted for any improper purpose, nonetheless, he recommended that both the plaintiff and the its attorney be sanctioned for their carelessness.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.196" offset="760097">That order was then affirmed first by the district court and then by the court of appeals over Business Guide's contention that Rule 11 does not permit the imposition of sanctions against a represented party for good-faith errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.145" offset="823940">It is that question which is now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.898" offset="838882">As to that matter, it is our submission that while there is no doubt that Rule 11, properly applied, serves not only a salutary but a necessary purpose, in the case of represented parties we believe that purpose can be fully satisfied by limiting that application of the rule to intentional abuse or recklessness that is substantially its equivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.345" offset="936685">It is our view that construing Rule 11 in that fashion is not only consistent with its history and language but that it will strike an appropriate balance between maintaining the efficiency and integrity of the litigation process while no overly deterring resort to that process and will as well strike an appropriate balance between the different roles and responsibilities of counsel and of representative parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.521" offset="1037413">Well, Mr. Bomse, why isn't it consistent with the rule and with the deterrent purpose of the Rule 11 to impose a reasonable inquiry standard on parties when they have occasion to file with the court, for example, factual affidavits or declarations in support of a motion for a preliminary restraining order or an injunction?</text>

            <text syncTime="268.218" offset="1204179">--No, I think the rule itself is actually silent on this particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.782" offset="1222464">Having in mind what this Court observed in Pavelic and LeFlore, a recent Rule 11 case, one does of course begin with the language of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.098" offset="1263738">But in this case I believe that language does not help us or, at least in an dispositive way, permit us to answer the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="290.904" offset="1294980">Well, I... you know, it's possible I think to conclude that what's reasonable for a party to make an inquiry might be somewhat different for what's reasonable for an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.424" offset="1353077">But it would appear that the same standard would apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="309.284" offset="1368437">Well, I'm not sure, Justice O'Connor, whether you're speaking now to the text of the rule or to how this Court as a matter policy ought to interpret it.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.641" offset="1397903">If you were speaking to the text of the rule, I would respectfully suggest that a parsing of its language would lead to the conclusion that we are not in fact given the answer to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.535" offset="1437504">And indeed, if you refer to the advisory committee notes to the rules, they are quite clear in saying that it is the signature of the attorney that violates the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.152" offset="1475957">It then goes on in the same sentence to say although it may be appropriate, in appropriate circumstances, also to impose the sanction upon the client.</text>

            <text syncTime="355.026" offset="1551398">The... then it goes on to talk about formed after a reasonable inquiry that is well-grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law.</text>

            <text syncTime="770.898" offset="3214876">But I don't think we need to reach the question of whether or not there would be any inhibition upon the rule establishing such a Rule 11 tort as we've called it in our brief, because I believe that the rule, properly interpreted, simply doesn't reach that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.329" offset="3280600">And I believe that if one accepts my view of the language of the rule, as leading us in effect agnostic as to this particular question, then what one needs to do is to turn to the purpose of the rule which, Justice O'Connor, you observed both in your question to me and in your opinion in Cooter &amp; Gell is deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.013" offset="3363356">But if I may, in that very opinion, in the same paragraph in which you announced that deterrence is the central purpose of Rule 11, you also made clear to caveat the fact that it must read with two other concerns in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.461" offset="3417168">First of all that it will lead to satellite litigation, something that the bar is very concerned with and which we think is implicated by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.565" offset="3449560">And second, that it will tend to chill the enthusiasm or willingness, if you will, of clients to be willing to bring litigation if they are concerned that their carelessness in the best of faith; their mistakes as in this case, will lead them to be sanctioned by a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.457" offset="3521135">It seems to me that when one asks about deterrence, one is not asking a question either about an absolute nor are you asking a question in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.205" offset="3560110">Rather it seems that deterrence first of all can be perfectly properly achieved by reading Rule 11 as we would have it read, that is, to apply to counsel who are professionals after all.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.894" offset="3614863">We do expect of counsel competence as well as good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.106" offset="3631790">And indeed there can be no question that the rule was amended in 1983 precisely to make that point explicit and to make the rule more robust when it came to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.712" offset="3674213">But just as we expect certain things from our counsel, also we expect and tolerate certain things from parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.978" offset="3703261">We certainly expect them not to proceed in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.731" offset="3718203">We do not expect them to harass, to use litigation, to impose costs or delays upon opposing parties, and that is surely a properly subject for the sanctioning of a party who engages in that kind of behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.541" offset="3777449">At the same time it does not seem to me that we either should nor need to achieve the purposes of the rule impose a sanction upon a client who is proceeding after all in good faith, who wishes to prevail in its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.220" offset="3844218">It avails such a party nothing to file a law suit based upon a mistake.</text>

            <text syncTime="1007.152" offset="4159986">When the judge's law clerk discovered that there were errors, it was at that point before Chromatics had ever filed a piece of paper, if my recollection serves, that the case was brought to a halt and the sanction proceedings began.</text>

            <text syncTime="1039.413" offset="4289031">Certainly the judge is at its very weakest so far as separating truth from error and so... on application for a temporary restraining order where there's no factual record developed, it's often heard largely ex parte.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.075" offset="4355591">And that's the very place where a negligent statement by a client can really do damage, because there isn't... you don't have discovery in that sort of thing before you get a temporary restraining order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1068.303" offset="4404492">But I am not aware of virtually any other Rule 11 case, and we are after all, at least as we would argue it, arguing for a rule of interpretation as to Rule 11.</text>

            <text syncTime="1080.750" offset="4454334">And it seems to me that we have to take into account that we are willing to tolerate mistakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.857" offset="4486726">We are willing indeed to tolerate the very essence of the American rule as to attorneys' fees is that we tolerate burdens being placed on people who are found sometimes, Justice Souter, after the expenditure of hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars and years in discovery before a summary judgment motion is granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.758" offset="4554331">We do not in this country, as a matter of policy, and other countries draw the policy line differently, but we do not elect to impose those kind of burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.863" offset="4590798">Just as we are tolerate, indeed tolerant beyond anything that remotely appears in this case, of clients in the form of witnesses or nonparty witnesses not merely being mistaken but actually getting on a witness stand and lying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.643" offset="4657880">It seems to me the court's decision in Briscoe against LaHue in which a police officer had testified in an admittedly perjured fashion was the nonetheless held to be absolutely immune specifically because of the concern that to have any different rule would unduly chill the adversary process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1582.619" offset="6461792">The key question before the Court today is whether a represented party who authorizes and participates directly in the filing of a meritless action without performing anything that even comes close to a reasonable inquiry into the facts of the case can be held accountable for the direct economic consequences which flow from his actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.953" offset="6543189">We respectfully submit that the factual hypothesis of that question is in fact in the record before you and that the answer to the question itself is most assuredly in the affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.230" offset="6588224">Raised by petitioner, and in fact the focus of petitioner's petition and argument today, is the issue of whether the conduct of such a represented party should be judged by an objective standard or by a subjective one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.059" offset="6643604">For reasons which I will discuss, we urge that the proper interpretation of Rule 11 leads to the application of an objective standard to such a party when viewed from the bench mark perspectives of statutory or rule construction, public policy, or judicial case management.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.640" offset="6709851">As I believe Business Guides agrees, we should start the interpretive process with the words of the rule or statute at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.347" offset="6756766">In fact, this Court said last term in the Pavelic case, we give the Federal rules of civil procedure their plain meaning and generally with them as with the statute, when we find the terms unambiguous, judicial inquiry is complete.</text>

            <text syncTime="2213.833" offset="8986683">I submit to you that a fair reading of that, and using all proper methods of statutory rule interpretation suggests, that when it says the signer, it means the signer, whether an attorney or party.</text>

            <text syncTime="2482.259" offset="10060316">As a matter of public policy, I think that a subjective standard brings with it some problems that probably exceed in scope the value of the rule itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2498.280" offset="10124473">As this Court said last term, the primary purpose of Rule 11 is to deter frivolous litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.435" offset="10153103">Implicit in that ruling, however, was the notion I believe that the deterrence should be accomplished with as little burden on the court as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.500" offset="10185286">The Court even noted that a secondary consideration is the avoidance of unnecessary satellite proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.393" offset="10208900">It is hard to imagine how a subjective standard would not cry out for satellite proceedings, such as were held in this case even though the Court was using an objective standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.701" offset="10254144">I think it takes no skilled practitioner of liable law to know that in public official liable law perhaps more attention is spent on the issue on the state of mind of the defendant than on the truth or falsehood of the charges made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.310" offset="10312554">Determining subjective state of mind is neither easy nor quick, and if the rule is intended to deter abuse without burdening the court, a subjective standard simply will not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.536" offset="10357485">To the extent this Court believes there is value in the attorney-client relationship, I would submit that a subjective standard does more damage to that relationship than could an objective standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.436" offset="10401057">First, it impinges on the attorney-client privileged communications because it is important in a subjective standard to determine what the party knew and what it thought and when.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.683" offset="10446092">It also I think creates a greater prospect of client and attorney blaming each other and pointing fingers at each other, thus destroying whatever might remain of that relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.707" offset="10486112">All of that of course would occur in satellite proceedings, which I think are largely unnecessary under an objective standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.933" offset="10515055">It also would allow, as in this case, a party to say, well, I got all my facts wrong, I didn't check them, but I subjectively believed in my case and be absolutely immune from any sanction under Rule 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.094" offset="10575660">The attorney in that same case can say, well, the client was the expert, as it did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.167" offset="10596035">We relied on the client for the facts, and that was not unreasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3133.357" offset="12664724">He's been under a cloud of the accusation of a plagiarist for over 4 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.099" offset="12683741">The action was dismissed, but that is still on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.211" offset="12696175">The district court recognized that under Rule 11 it could not do complete justice, but what it could do is dismiss the case both as a sanction for the violation of the rule and because it determined on the basis of the record before it that the case had absolutely no factual merit whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.292" offset="12764512">It also recognized that it could at least as some recompense give the wrongfully accused defendant those limited expenses incurred before the trial court itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.211" offset="12816130">It did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.012" offset="12819369">That justice was all it could do or at least all it believed it could do at the time and was limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.164" offset="12839953">And we would simply ask this Court to affirm that limited grant of justice.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen V. Bomse</label>
            <text syncTime="3186.822" offset="12878615">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.982" offset="12879242">My reading of the rule is both narrower and broader than that suggested by opposing counsel and indeed by some of the Court's questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.651" offset="12929919">I believe that the language of the second sentence of the rule, which in an attempt to redeem myself, Justice Scalia, we did cite at... in our discussion of the language at page 4 of our reply brief, that the language of the rule makes clear that it is intended to apply when it uses the term</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.601" offset="13005779">"or party to a pro se party. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.764" offset="13018422">Beyond that, however, it seems to me that the rule which will be the situation in the vast majority of cases and I realize this Court sits to decided cases or controversies, but in the vast majority of Rule 11 cases, the courts are going to be confronted with cases in which the represented party has signed nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.149" offset="13103895">Thus, the rule which talks later about a represented party being sanctioned would not under the literal interpretation, which only would permit sanctions against a signer, have any application in that circumstance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3256.589" offset="13157707">How do you... how do you deal with the language,</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.849" offset="13166693">"the rule and sanction that can be imposed against the person who signed it, the party or both. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.084" offset="13191666">even only one person signed it?</text>

            <text syncTime="3267.375" offset="13200861">It is precisely what I'm trying... trying to do, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.429" offset="13217057">I am suggesting that that sentence is there to tell the district court that in an appropriate circumstance somebody who did not sign, namely a represented party, may be sanctioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.137" offset="13263869">And indeed that is precisely what the rules advisory committee said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.618" offset="13281841">Let me read,</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.129" offset="13283826">"Even though it is the attorney whose signature violates the rule, it may be appropriate under the circumstance of the case to impose a sanction on the client. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.313" offset="13316531">I believe this rule can be read in an integrated, sensible fashion and I believe we are left when we do that with the question of what rule is it that will best accommodate the competing policy considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.262" offset="13372329">On the one hand, the desire to deter the filing of frivolous litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.136" offset="13391869">Sanctioning an attorney who does not make a reasonable inquiry will do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.539" offset="13409527">The only reason that the sanction cannot be collected in this particular case is the unfortunate circumstance that Business Guides' attorneys are in bankruptcy, although following Pavelic and LeFlore, they could have sued... and should indeed have only sued... the individual attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.150" offset="13479953">So there is not a situation where my interpretation will leave parties who incur expenses without a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.114" offset="13507748">They will have that remedy against counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.975" offset="13515271">As to the parties, we need not for any purpose of deterrence, have a rule which deters the useless of filing a law suit which they believed to be legitimate but is not in fact because that will readily be revealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.135" offset="13567829">It will, on the other hand, chill the expression of people who are concerned that a judge may someday view their actions as objectionably unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.101" offset="13603774">A subjective standard of bad faith is easy for a client to know about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.244" offset="13624358">And clients come in all shapes, sizes, and degrees of intelligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.708" offset="13642122">I think we should not permit them to be sanctioned under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.040" offset="13659467">It seems to me that a rule makes sense only when as the economist would say, ex ante, it provides adequate guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.754" offset="13686321">I suggest that the rule we propose does that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3392.258" offset="13700322">And is that the case when client is representing himself as well, so that you have nobody to go against for simply no reasonable inquiry?</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.261" offset="13728326">Or are you proposing this rule only when you're going behind the lawyer to get the client?</text>

            <text syncTime="3406.837" offset="13758628">If you are a pro se party, you have elected, perhaps unwisely, to take on those burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.101" offset="13783705">And I think that that is clearly what the rule has in mind.</text>
