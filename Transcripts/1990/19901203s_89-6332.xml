            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73964">The opinion of the Court in No. 89-6332, Minnick against Mississippi will be announced by Justice Kennedy.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="8.142" offset="106460">This is the Court's opinion in Minnick versus Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.446" offset="119731">The case is before us as a capital case on certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.790" offset="149092">In Edwards versus Arizona, we held that once a suspect in police custody invokes his Fifth Amendment right to counsel, he may not be questioned further unless his lawyer is present or unless the suspect himself initiates the conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.822" offset="209174">This is true even if the suspect is given new Miranda warnings before he makes the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.746" offset="228922">Today's case presents the question whether the Edwards' bar to further interrogation applies after the suspect has conferred with his counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.407" offset="263508">Petitioner, Robert Minnick, was arrested in California for two murders committed in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.391" offset="283466">Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed Minnick in a San Diego jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.047" offset="302065">The interview ended when the petitioner asked the questioning cease until he had a lawyer present, a right identified by this Court in Miranda versus Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.713" offset="336756">Between Saturday, the day of the FBI interview, and the following Monday, Minnick conferred with the lawyer on two or three occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.540" offset="376044">Then on Monday, a Mississippi Deputy Sheriff again interrogated Minnick.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.533" offset="396002">Minnick did not initiate the interview and, in fact, testified that he jailers told him he could not refuse to talk to the Deputy.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.885" offset="425468">His lawyer was not present during questioning and Minnick made incriminating statements that were used against him in his Mississippi murder trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.198" offset="454725">He was convicted and sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.996" offset="465905">The Mississippi Supreme Court determined that Edwards does not apply once the suspect has consulted with an attorney and then response to questions after new Miranda warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.931" offset="505611">We now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.589" offset="512299">Our cases interpret the Edwards rule to bar police-initiated interrogation unless the accused has counsel with him at the time of questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.108" offset="542392">The exception proposed by the State of Mississippi is inconsistent with Edwards' purpose to protect the suspect's right to have counsel present at custodial interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.799" offset="581157">The exception would undermine the advantages flowing from Edwards' clear and unequivocal character.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.733" offset="604877">Under the formulation of the rule proposed by the State of Mississippi, the protection of Edwards could pass in and out of existence multiple times prior to arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.857" offset="641344">Moreover, consultation is not a precise concept where it may encompass variations from a telephone call to say that the attorney is on route to see the client to a hurried interchange between the attorney and the client in a detention facility corridor, to a lengthy in-person conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.869" offset="713337">The inquiries necessary to determine whether a particular consultation was sufficient to permit further interrogation could interfere with the attorney-client privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.067" offset="746147">In addition, the proposal would have the disturbing consequence that a suspect whose counsel is prompt would lose the protection of Edwards, while one whose counsel is a dilatory would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.107" offset="786375">We hold, then, that when counsel is requested, interrogation must cease and officials may not re-interrogate without counsel present whether or not the accused has had consultations with his attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.674" offset="840606">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice joins;</text>
            <text syncTime="195.816" offset="857220">Justice Souter took no part in the consideration of decision of the case.</text>
