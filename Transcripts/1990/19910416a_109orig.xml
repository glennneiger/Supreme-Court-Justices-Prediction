            <text syncTime="12.632" offset="179739">This is an original proceeding involving the states of New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma, and it involves the Canadian River Compact, a compact negotiated and signed by the parties in 1950 and adopted by Congress in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.930" offset="236894">New Mexico takes exception to Part VII of the Special Master's Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.602" offset="255598">The issue is whether under the compact New Mexico is entitled to unrestricted storage of all waters of the Canadian River originating above Conchas Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.102" offset="301678">New Mexico submits that it is entitled to such storage, unrestricted either as to quantity or as to place under the terms of the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.328" offset="342534">The Canadian River rises in northeast New Mexico and it flows through the panhandle of Texas eventually over into Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.274" offset="378269">There are three dams along the way which are of interest in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.408" offset="398854">The first, in New Mexico, is the Conchas Dam, built in 1939, 11 years before the compact was ever signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.843" offset="432604">65 river miles further east is Ute Dam, or Ute Reservoir, which is also located in the State of New Mexico, and was built in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.841" offset="480565">And then another 165 river miles further east is Lake Meredith, which is located north of Amarillo, Texas, and was built in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.959" offset="525077">There are two provisions of the compact which are at issue in this litigation to the extent that New Mexico takes exception with the Master's Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.905" offset="568859">We believe that the language of those two provisions is critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.318" offset="586517">The compact itself is set forth as an appendix either to the Special Master's Report or to New Mexico's brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="128.598" offset="643569">It's Appendix A to New Mexico... excuse me, Appendix A to New Mexico's brief, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.965" offset="665094">And specifically, the part that I'm going to ask the Court to look at is on page 2a.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.549" offset="695396">It is Article IV(a) and Article IV(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="144.561" offset="707412">Article IV(a) gives New Mexico free and unrestricted use of all waters originating in the drainage basin on the Canadian River above the Conchas Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.619" offset="759657">And Article IV(b) gives New Mexico free and unrestricted use of all waters originating below the Conchas Dam, subject to a 200,000 acre-foot conservation storage limitation on waters originating below Conchas.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.002" offset="833218">The dispute in reference to Article IV and what it means arose about a year and a half after this litigation originally began.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.449" offset="871043">Initially Texas and Oklahoma had sued the State of New Mexico, claiming that the size of Ute Reservoir, which was enlarged in 1984, violated Article IV(b) and Article II(d) of the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.309" offset="934468">The Master has resolved that issue in favor of New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.233" offset="950142">Article IV(a) and (b) became a major focus after Conchas began to spill in the spring of 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.200" offset="990057">It was the first major spill of the Conchas Dam since approximately 1941-42, which of course predates the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.326" offset="1026524">Being a spill, the water flowed over Conchas and downstream into Ute Reservoir, and approximately 100,000 acre-feet of that water, about 40 percent of the spill, was either released or went ahead and spilled into Texas, presumably most of it flowing on to Lake Meredith.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.761" offset="1108235">New Mexico caught about 60 percent of those Conchas spill waters at the Ute Reservoir, and it did not count those spill waters against its 200,000 acre-foot limitation on below Conchas waters, and the reason was because the spill came from waters originating above Conchas, and under Article IV(a) there was no restriction on how much water New Mexico got to store if it originated above Conchas.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.770" offset="1448349">The result of catching the spills in the Ute Reservoir in 1987 was that as a result Ute Reservoir exceeded 200,000 acre-feet of storage.</text>

            <text syncTime="861.204" offset="3573985">Yes, Oklahoma has.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.295" offset="3578374">Under IV(b) of the compact, again as I indicated, there is no restriction on the use of the waters below Conchas, but there is this 200,000 acre-foot limitation of the storage of the waters originating below Conchas.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.759" offset="3652248">And that is specifically what the language of IV(b) says.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.950" offset="3664996">From the standpoint of contract law, from the standpoint of statutory interpretation, because we are here dealing with both a contract and an act of Congress, I would suggest to you that the language of IV(a) and IV(b) has to control unless it is somehow ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.724" offset="3740124">The report found that there is ambiguity in part because it was unclear what the rights were between New Mexico and Colorado under IV(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="916.302" offset="3794459">We question whether there is a true ambiguity in reading IV(a) that way, but even if it is, Colorado is not a party to the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.830" offset="3836568">Colorado is not a party to this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.631" offset="3847748">It is at best an irrelevant ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.425" offset="3862899">And I would suggest to the Court that it would be very bad precedent to rewrite compacts between sovereign states based upon alleged ambiguities which are unrelated to the dispute that has arisen among the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.225" offset="3922145">The fact is that there is no ambiguity in the language of IV(a) and IV(b), and no one has suggested a reasonable alternative meaning to the plain language of those, of that portion of the compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.686" offset="3984003">As I indicated, we feel that the distinction between Article IV(a) and IV(b), and I by shorthand refer to it as upper basin and lower basin, has a geographical, has a geographical basis, and that the basins fall, in the way they are fed and the way the dams are fed, makes sense within the context of the compact and gives meaning to the distinction made between IV(a) and IV(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="991.936" offset="4096957">We have talked about that some.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.357" offset="4106674">I'd like to move now to the question of the historical context of this compact and how it is consistent also with New Mexico's reading of IV(a) and IV(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.196" offset="4157979">In 1950 Texas wanted Federal money to build the Sanford Project, which later became Lake Meredith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.241" offset="4194132">New Mexico had some powerful Senators at the time, Senator Anderson and Senator Javis, and they said no, Texas, we're not going to permit you to get the funding for the Sanford Project until and unless there is a compact which protects the rights of New Mexice in the waters of the Canadian River basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.020" offset="4293293">And in fact the legislation which authorized Sanford Project was contingent upon approval of the compact being negotiated and being approved by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.666" offset="4339895">The parties sat down in 1950 over roughly a 6-month period, and they negotiated the Canadian River Basin Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.634" offset="4391722">As a result of those negotiations New Mexico received two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.558" offset="4411471">New Mexico received the right to all the waters above Conchas without restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.533" offset="4435399">Now I think it's important to understand here that prior to that time the waters above Conchas had been fully developed, so that New Mexico, under equitable doctrines of water law, was entitled to those rights anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.070" offset="4497466">And the only issue above Conchas was the spill water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.934" offset="4512930">But as part of the negotiating process Texas and Oklahoma agreed, New Mexico, you will have all the waters above Conchas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.212" offset="4554099">And then the second thing that New Mexico received was protection for its as yet undeveloped rights below Conchas up to the 200,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.338" offset="4602583">This was important because at that time, though there were a few uses, below Conchas waters had really not been appropriated by anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.374" offset="4638736">And if Texas built Lake Meredith and there had not been a compact, what eventually would have happened is that Texas, under the doctrine of priority, or prior appropriation, would end up with the waters of the lower basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.294" offset="4698400">New Mexico, of course, would have had the upper waters, the waters above Conchas, because it had already established rights in those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.700" offset="4727970">And so what the parties did was agree that New Mexico could have up to 200,000 acre-feet of those waters which originate below Conchas so that in the future at some time it could do the development that it wanted to.</text>
