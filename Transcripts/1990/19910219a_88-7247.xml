            <text syncTime="1995.054" offset="8110451">Now at that point the defense attorney objects because she said I want him to be sentenced today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.749" offset="8137201">If she really thought that it was a surprise, believe me, I believe she would have gone right through the ceiling and asked for more time, asked for a rehearing, reconsideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="2028.319" offset="8243467">The benefit came because the prosecutor was very articulate in closing argument at sentencing identifying that in his opinion the defendant was the less culpable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.495" offset="8296130">But the judge is the one that has to make that ultimate decision; and under Idaho law he is required to follow a step by step procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2625.176" offset="10630954">I believe that any, the problems that counsel for the petitioner basically speak to are greatly related to the fact that she did not become counsel until September 20, and then after she became cocounsel moved to discharge a trial counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.233" offset="10727085">And this is something that the defendant brought upon himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.134" offset="10742758">The judge made it very clear from the beginning that he would have problems with continuing the hearing because witnesses were under subpoena, and the case had already been, had been tried actually back in March, and this was an October sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.368" offset="10819663">I believe that to a great extent any problems that exist have to be laid at the doorstep of the defendant himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.892" offset="10849756">Throughout this sentencing proceeding trial counsel was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.956" offset="10873997">Trial counsel knew, and admitted it through testimony given at a motion for new trial, that the death penalty was at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.622" offset="10912659">And in fact during one question and answer period when Ms. Fisher questioned Mr. Longeteig on the point, the comment was made, Mr. Longeteig, did you understand that death was a possibility here, or an option, and he said yes, I read the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.565" offset="10992489">And that's essentially what our position is, that in reading the statute for first degree murder and the punishment provisions, it's very clear that death was an option and that a sentencing judge would be called upon to follow the provisions of 19-2515.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.518" offset="11060303">And that the prosecutor could not in any way alter the course of that proceeding by a recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.142" offset="11094784">His recommendation was merely advisory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.844" offset="11105547">What you have here is a situation where the judge was required also to take the evidence that was produced at trial and apply it to the standards in 19-2515, essentially providing, applying known facts to a known procedure in the capital sentencing process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2870.482" offset="11612113">Number one is the April 5th hearing in which the defense requested notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.435" offset="11627891">I think if you look at that transcript there is, there is a couple of things that you have to remember.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.979" offset="11646072">First, the defense, when they requested it, said, whether or not the State seeks the death penalty will materially alter the manner in which we approach this, this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.927" offset="11693929">Secondly, the prosecutor indicated his intent to let the defense know in an early manner so that the defense would have plenty of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.103" offset="11730605">Now the court does, following that colloquy between the defense attorney and the trial, the prosecutor, does say well, regardless of the notice there will have to be an inquiry under 2515.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.100" offset="11774595">However, I didn't have the transcript.</text>

            <text syncTime="2914.773" offset="11789328">And Mr. Echohawk indicates that Mr. Longeteig was available to me; however, the record will reflect that the trial court had to order Mr. Longeteig to stay in the courtroom at my beck and call.</text>
