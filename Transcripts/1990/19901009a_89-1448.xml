            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="140282">We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 89-1448, Virginia Bankshares v. Doris I. Sandberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.570" offset="174555">Mr. Shapiro.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen M. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="9.606" offset="178630">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.093" offset="204648">As this Court has explained on a number of occasions, expansive interpretation of implied securities law remedies carries with it a danger, a danger of vexatious litigation and erosion of basic principles of federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.202" offset="269013">This is a case which raises those same fundamental concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.339" offset="285627">This is a merger case in which minority shareholders received 30 percent more for their shares than those shares ever traded for, but they nonetheless filed suit in State court demanding more money.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.564" offset="334529">Plaintiffs were denied an appraisal remedy and an injunction remedy in the State court, and the State supreme court ultimately denied review.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.670" offset="366920">So they decided to bring their complaint to Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.038" offset="380400">This shift in forums resulted in a remarkable improvement in plaintiffs' fortunes.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.858" offset="403701">Under the Fourth Circuit's ruling in this case, more than $13 million may change hands, based on two alleged defects in the proxy statement that was used in the merger, even though the majority shareholder owned enough shares to complete the merger without the votes of any minority shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.070" offset="476530">These alleged misleading passages in the proxy statement were held to be the cause of those millions of dollars in damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.724" offset="507146">It is no coincidence that plaintiffs have used these rulings from the court of appeals to obtain indirectly the appraisal remedy which the Commonwealth of Virginia has determined should not be available in bank merger cases of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.150" offset="560853">I'd like to mention at the outset an important point of agreement between ourselves and the SEC, something which is a rarity in securities litigation before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.606" offset="602649">I can't think of another case in which the SEC has told this Court that a judgment in favor of securities law plaintiffs was, quote, "in error".</text>
            <text syncTime="125.064" offset="640475">But that is what the SEC has advised the Court here, and on this point the SEC is surely right.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.134" offset="664716">In simple terms, the jury never found that the millions of dollars in damages that were awarded here were in any way caused or brought about by the alleged defects in the proxy statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.525" offset="710378">And that is because of the jury charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.159" offset="720827">The jury charge described the requirement of causation, but it then proceeded to instruct the jury that causation was, quote, "sufficiently shown" if the allegedly misleading proxy statement was an essential link in the transaction, that is if it was necessary under State law for the defendants to solicit proxies.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.105" offset="800658">The jury also was instructed that it was no defense that the votes of the minority shareholders were not needed to approve the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.378" offset="833781">Now the SEC has explained why these causation instructions are erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.615" offset="854679">There is no basis for finding that millions of dollars in damages have been caused simply because the challenged proxy statement was required by State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.887" offset="895743">In a case like Mills against Electric Auto-Lite, where the plaintiff shareholders had enough votes to make a difference in the outcome of the shareholder election, a materially misleading proxy statement disseminated to all of the shareholders logically supported a finding of causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.349" offset="961676">But in this case any alleged errors in the proxy statement were completely irrelevant to the outcome of the shareholders' vote--</text>

            <text syncTime="233.868" offset="1075675">And that, of course, is this case which is before the Court today.</text>

            <text syncTime="331.782" offset="1467407">What they have said is that the instructions here are not defensible, and that the rationale of the court of appeals is in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.769" offset="1491335">Now this afterthought that plaintiffs have offered to defend the rulings below, after they set aside the essential link theory, in addition to being a point that wasn't raised below, is a hopelessly speculative theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="365.003" offset="1600213">And there is actual litigation experience in Virginia that directly refutes their theory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1385.820" offset="5683466">Here there was, in fact, a memorandum prepared by the general counsel which said that they did focus on the high premium, 30 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.224" offset="5713141">They all testified that that was their conviction and their basis for making this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.712" offset="5731113">Now, it's important in assessing this claim to keep in mind that now the SEC requires directors to state their opinion on the issue of fairness in every merger of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.567" offset="5774476">And if claims of director insincerity or ulterior motivation could be brought into Federal court without the kind of objective supporting evidence that I'm talking about, every State appraisal grievance would be brought into Federal court in disregard of this Court's decision in Green v. Santa Fe, and in disregard of the principles that this Court articulated in Blue Chip Stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.016" offset="5860262">The Court warned in Blue Chip Stamps against conjectural and speculative inquiries into subjective issues, as opposed to, quote, "objectively demonstrable fact".</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.955" offset="5900073">And the lower Federal courts, as I have mentioned, consistently have held... there isn't a single case that we were able to find where a claim like this of director insincerity that didn't have specific supporting objective evidence was permitted to go to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.714" offset="5955035">If the Court affirms here, this will be the first case, and it will truly open up a Pandora's box where appraisal remedies are brought into Federal court simply by pleading that they didn't really believe, or they didn't sincerely believe that this price was high.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.606" offset="6006653">That would overrule Green v. Santa Fe effectively and truly burden the Federal courts with an outpouring of new, and I believe vexatious, litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.145" offset="6040821">Now, the last claim of misrepresentation is, I must say, almost impossible for me to understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.817" offset="6075511">The sin here apparently was that the proxy statement described one of the Nation's top investment banking firms as being independent, and said that it passed on financial fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.458" offset="6118039">Well, it was independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.191" offset="6125040">It was an outside, unaffiliated, autonomous investment banking firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.445" offset="6141967">And as the SEC explains in its brief, liability cannot be predicated on the theory that it wasn't independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.183" offset="6168925">And in addition, this investment banker did pass on financial fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.087" offset="6188569">It reviewed a variety of financial data, and it applied a variety of analytical techniques.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.455" offset="6210094">And of course at the end of the process it issued an opinion on the issue of financial fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.192" offset="6229007">Now, plaintiffs may disagree with that opinion, and plaintiffs may dislike its methodology, but they can't deny that this opinion was actually rendered on the issue of financial fairness.</text>

            <text syncTime="1578.612" offset="6454705">One, counsel says this morning that the reason the bank engaged in the solicitation was a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.301" offset="6485425">But there was no evidence to the jury that that was the reason for the solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.837" offset="6503606">In fact, as recently as the reply brief, on page 4 at note 5, the petitioners were representing that the reason for the solicitation was that State law in fact required it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.061" offset="6544462">There was plenty of evidence on the other hand, Your Honor, as to the reason for the solicitation before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.981" offset="6572151">We've summarized it in our brief, and I don't want to dwell on it here, but there was plenty of evidence as to the reason... the reasons that have been adverted to in some of the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.789" offset="6623351">And in any event, petitioners made no motion for a directed verdict on grounds it lacked sufficient proof to prove causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.045" offset="6660445">Now also, counsel now says that the petitioners did tender a different instruction of their own on causation, and that they did object to the pertinent causation instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.006" offset="6720213">But that is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.656" offset="6726901">The proximate cause instruction that counsel refers to was one that was tendered by both sides, and one that Judge Bryan gave at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.814" offset="6767443">Petitioners, at page 81 and 82 and page 92 of the joint appendix, you will see where petitioners submitted their own instruction to the jury, telling Judge Bryan here is how it should be instructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.872" offset="6819688">And that instruction provides that if the jury finds that the... it was phrased in this way: that there is no requirement that the plaintiff prove reliance if she proves that the proxy solicitation was an essential link in accomplishing the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.299" offset="6881441">And so, Your Honor, the very instruction that petitioners say now was error is exactly the instruction that they asked Judge Bryan--</text>

            <text syncTime="3121.362" offset="12625663">Why shouldn't we interpret the 14(a) private right of action as narrowly as possible, and say that the only right of action you have is when as a result of the solicitation you have been misled, either you or other minority shareholders who could have stopped the merger and were unable to.</text>

            <text syncTime="3491.658" offset="14106911">They are of course related points, but they are distinct and they were presented distinctly in the court of appeals here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3512.053" offset="14188413">Now, the argument was made that the defendants here had conceded that it is somehow necessary to go to the shareholders and get shareholder approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.826" offset="14227492">If you look at that quotation in the appendix, all that it says is that it is necessary under State law to get two-thirds of the votes of the shareholders.</text>

            <text syncTime="3541.239" offset="14305232">They had statutory rights here to proceed with this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.858" offset="14319652">Now, the argument was also made that we had presented to the jury the conflict of interest statute, and that indeed we tendered that causation theory to the jury ourselves by citing that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.884" offset="14383809">It had nothing to do with the causation issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.320" offset="14393526">That statute is a safe harbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.303" offset="14401467">It merely says that mergers such as this cannot be challenged in State court if one of three criteria are satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.539" offset="14430411">And we merely pointed out that the individual directors who were sued under State law couldn't be attacked because of that safe harbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.793" offset="14459355">The idea that this was somehow presented to the jury as a causation theory is fantastic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.947" offset="14480044">It was never presented to the jury in any such guise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.216" offset="14489134">If the Court please, unless there are further questions, that would conclude our argument.</text>
