            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="74044">The third case which I have to announce is Florida against Jimeno No. 90-622.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.407" offset="99644">The respondent in this case, Louis Jimeno, was stopped by the police in Florida for a traffic violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.845" offset="125348">The police asked him for permission to search his car for drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.430" offset="143739">Jimeno gave his consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.421" offset="151680">The police searched and discovered a paper bag containing a killer gram of cocaine on the floorboard of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.391" offset="179579">The Florida Supreme Court suppressed this evidence based upon its view that under the Fourth Amendment, a general consent to the search of ones car does not extend to close containers such as the bag found here in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.855" offset="237362">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reverse the decision of the Supreme Court of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.241" offset="258991">The scope of a consent search is defined by the terms of the consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.503" offset="276023">A police officer here told Jimeno he had reason to suspect there were narcotics in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.502" offset="299951">He asked for permission to search it.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.798" offset="309146">Jimeno granted permission, placed no limitation on the consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.693" offset="328790">Under these circumstances, it was objectively reasonable for the officer to believe that Jimenos consent extended to a paper bag lying on the floor of the car, a bag which might contain drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.041" offset="374139">A reasonable officer would know that narcotics are generally carried in some form of container.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.772" offset="397126">The Fourth Amendment requires only that a search be reasonable under the terms of the consent and we hold that this one was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.264" offset="427011">Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Stevens joined.</text>
