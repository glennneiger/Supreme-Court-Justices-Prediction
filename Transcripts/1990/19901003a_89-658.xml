            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text>We'll hear argument next in No. 89-658, John L. Cheek v. United States.</text>

            <label>Mr. William R. Coulson</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>This is a criminal tax case.</text>
            <text>Just before sentencing the petitioner, John L. Cheek, the district court said to him,</text>
            <text>"I do not want to sentence you for beliefs that I believe were honestly held, although I believe foolishly held."</text>
            <text>That is the district court speaking, and that is what this case is fundamentally all about.</text>
            <text>Petitioner John Cheek's defense, albeit a pro se defense, was a classic mistake of law based in part on advice he got from counsel.</text>
            <text>He contended that at all times of the alleged offenses he had a bona fide misunderstanding of his duties under the tax laws.</text>
            <text>This is a recognized defense.</text>
            <text>It was articulated by this Court in Murdock in 1933, some 57 years ago.</text>
            <text>However, not more than 3 weeks before petitioner's trial commenced before the Seventh Circuit... before the district court in Chicago, the Seventh Circuit in October of 1987 in the United States v. Buckner decided that in so-called tax-protester cases it wasn't enough that the tax defendant's misunderstanding or belief, as the Seventh Circuit calls it, be sincerely held or bona fide per Murdock, but also the defendant's understanding or belief of the tax laws had to be found by the jury to be objectively reasonable, whatever that means.</text>
            <text>Moreover, as to certain enumerated understandings, or beliefs, or misunderstandings of the tax laws, it wasn't enough even for a defendant to convince a jury that he sincerely possessed the misunderstanding and that the misunderstanding was objectively reasonable.</text>
            <text>But as to those listed beliefs the Seventh Circuit held that they were forever objectively unreasonable as a matter of law.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Coulson, you don't have to go to law school to learn that traditionally mistake of law is... is no defense.</text>
            <text>Why is there, why should it be a defense here, because of the word willfully in the statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_r_coulson">
            <label>Mr. William R. Coulson</label>
            <text>Because this Court and other courts have recognized that in the criminal tax statutes, the mistake of law defense has particular vitality.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Why should that be?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_r_coulson">
            <label>Mr. William R. Coulson</label>
            <text>Because the tax codes are complex in numerous respects.</text>
            <text>Unlike most criminal statutes they are malum prohibitum rather than malum in se.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>So do we import these same standards into the antitrust laws, which are also complex... the case laws if not statutory?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_r_coulson">
            <label>Mr. William R. Coulson</label>
            <text>I'm not suggesting that the doctrine that we suggest remain the law of the land be applied to anything other than criminal tax statutes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But why should criminal tax statutes be singled out for this treatment?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_r_coulson">
            <label>Mr. William R. Coulson</label>
            <text>This Court has singled them out for that treatment and other courts have, recognizing that in the tax area it is easy, relatively easy for a well-minded individual to violate the law, because the law is complex.</text>
            <text>Mistake of law has particular vitality in this... under these... in this context and under the criminal tax statutes.</text>
            <text>And I say that not only because this Court has said that, the circuits have said that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, what if the taxpayer understood that the law says you'll file a tax return, but genuinely believed the... the tax law was unconstitutional?</text>
            <text>Would that be a defense to willfulness?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_r_coulson">
            <label>Mr. William R. Coulson</label>
            <text>No, but it's... personal belief that a known statute is unconstitutional smacks of knowledge with existing law, but disagreement with it.</text>
            <text>And I am not suggesting that any individuals--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, someone in good faith believes it.</text>
            <text>It is not objectively reasonable to believe that, but that is the belief.</text>
            <text>Now is that a defense to willfulness?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_r_coulson">
            <label>Mr. William R. Coulson</label>
            <text>--It depends on the nature of the defense.</text>
            <text>If the person believes as a personal belief that known... law known to them is unconstitutional, I submit that that would not be a defense, because what the person is really saying is I know what the law is, for constitutional reasons I have made my own determination that it is invalid.</text>
            <text>I am not suggesting that that is a defense.</text>
            <text>However, if the person was told by a lawyer or by an accountant erroneously that the statute is unconstitutional, and it's my professional advice to you that you don't have to follow it, then you have got a little different situation.</text>
            <text>This is not that case--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="william_r_coulson">
            <label>Mr. William R. Coulson</label>
            <text>--You instruct the jury that disagreement with known law is not a defense.</text>
            <text>You instruct the jury that--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">

            <text>--Known to the defendant.</text>
            <text>All of... our position obviously is that all of this deals with the defendant's personal view, the defendant's personal state of mind, the defendant's personal knowledge.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. William R. Coulson</label>

            <label>Mr. William R. Coulson</label>
            <text>--No, he knew of his duties under the tax laws a la Murdock.</text>
            <text>That is a little broader than just knowing there is a statute on the books.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>He knows... he knows his duty under the statute, and he knows that it's the [inaudible] of the Government to prosecute if he violates that duty.</text>
            <text>Is that sufficient?</text>

            <label>Mr. William R. Coulson</label>
            <text>No, because it would depend on the particular misunderstanding that is in issue.</text>
            <text>A defendant may believe that... that bribes that he receives is not income.</text>
            <text>He may believe that, as in this case, wages he receives are not income.</text>

            <text>We think he is sincere, what does this mean?</text>
            <text>The judge reinstructed him, and then the judge instructed him that, per Buckner, wages of not income is a prohibited belief.</text>
            <text>It cannot form the basis for a good-faith defense.</text>
            <text>But that was not tendered until after the jury was out, after the jury had had some questions.</text>
            <text>And I think it illustrates the difficulty that Judge Plunkett and other district judges have had trying to apply this Buckner-Cheek doctrine.</text>
            <text>There are a lot of other problems with Buckner-Cheek.</text>

            <text>This Buckner-Cheek doctrine, you look at the Buckner and Cheek and the Dunkel case, in the Seventh Circuit it is applied only to tax protesters.</text>
            <text>It is not applied to more traditional tax-evasion defendants in the Seventh Circuit.</text>

            <text>To me the idea that the Seventh Circuit has deliberately treated tax protesters differently than other tax defendants to whom it is equally applicable is not fairly subsumed in those questions.</text>
            <text>The first is</text>
            <text>"Is the Seventh Circuit's unique approach, under which petitioner was convicted and jailed because a panel announced that his sincerely held beliefs were unreasonable and therefore impermissible, consistent with the statutes under which petitioner was convicted."</text>

            <text>Those are complaints about the way the Seventh Circuit decide... decided your client's case.</text>
            <text>They don't to me import any suggestion that the Seventh Circuit is not even handed in deciding similarly situated cases.</text>

            <label>Mr. William R. Coulson</label>
            <text>--No, I think it is fairly subsumed in our issues, because the Buckner-Cheek doctrine expressly, expressly... the Seventh Circuit said we are... have to deal with annoying tax protesters.</text>
            <text>That is their term, annoying tax protesters.</text>
            <text>Thorns in the side of the Federal judiciary, the Seventh Circuit calls these annoying tax protesters.</text>
            <text>Well, I would expect a Federal judiciary has developed a thick enough hide to be able to tolerate these annoying thorns.</text>
            <text>All we're asking this Court to do is to have John Cheek treated like any other tax-evasion defendant in the Seventh Circuit, like any other tax-evasion defendant anywhere else in the country.</text>
            <text>And that is if he can establish his bona fides to a jury, if he can show the jury that he was... had a sincere and good-faith misunderstanding of his duties under the tax law, he has negated willfulness and he is entitled to be acquitted.</text>
            <text>And to be sure, the Government is going to collect its taxes.</text>
            <text>They are going to collect civil penalties, and so forth.</text>
            <text>But they should not be able to convict him of a criminal offense unless they show he acted willfully.</text>
            <text>And under this Court's rulings he did not act wilfully if he had a good-faith misunderstanding of his duty.</text>
            <text>And we're... all we are asking is tha he permitted to have a jury make that judgment.</text>
            <text>And there is nothing more fundamental, I think, in our criminal justice system than the notion that the issue of criminal intent is one for the jury.</text>
            <text>It's not one for the Seventh Circuit, it is not one that ignores in all situations the genesis of a defendant's claimed misunderstanding.</text>
            <text>Cheek went to seminars.</text>
            <text>He had lawyers tell him this stuff.</text>
            <text>He did not act with criminal intent, and he never got the opportunity because of Buckner-Cheek to have a jury pass on it.</text>
            <text>That's really all we are asking.</text>
            <text>And I think that the Government's position would represent a radical departure from subtle law going back though Murdock, going back through Bishop, the cases we cite in our brief.</text>
            <text>But I think to disrupt, to unsettle the law on such a fundamental element as the need for a jury to pass on criminal intent simply because of the occasional John Cheeks of the world is... is unfair and it is unwise on the part of the Government.</text>
            <text>The Government does not need to win this case.</text>
            <text>They don't need it to enforce the tax laws.</text>
            <text>They don't need it in the other circuits.</text>
            <text>And this Court should not, on this kind of a showing by the Government, depart from 57 years of settled law under the criminal justice system.</text>

          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>The obvious purpose of the criminal tax statutes, as this Court recognized in the Spies case, is to induce the prompt fulfillment of every duty under the tax laws.</text>
            <text>At the same time the Court has understood Congress not to want to punish what it termed innocent errors made despite the exercise of reasonable care in trying to comply with the complex tax code, those provisions that are complex.</text>
            <text>And this Court has construed that criminal tax statute in a line of cases that seek to give effect to both of those purposes, in particular as the Court stated in Bishop, and I quote,</text>
            <text>"It has construed the term willfully in a way that implements the intent of Congress to construct penalties that separate the purposeful tax violator on the one hand from the well-meaning but easily confused mass of taxpayers on the other."</text>
            <text>In this case petitioner Cheek is far removed from the category of innocent but well meaning class of categories, those seeking to comply with the sometimes complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text>He didn't commit innocent errors in... in connection with such complex provisions.</text>
            <text>Despite his awareness of the basic requirements of the code, he declined, refused to comply with the most basic and universally applicable provisions of the code.</text>
            <text>He declined to file tax returns, and he declined to--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, the Seventh Circuit though said it didn't make any difference whether his actions were innocent if they were not objectively reasonable.</text>
            <text>So to argue here that they weren't even innocent, I don't think is very acceptable.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>--No, but the point I am making, sir... Chief Justice, is the fact that the most basic obligations in the tax code that are at issue here, the duty to file a return and the duty to acknowledge that wages are taxable income, a belief that a person doesn't have to comply with those provisions is not objectively reasonable.</text>
            <text>The Seventh Circuit was addressing a category of... of assertions in this case--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But you made the statement that he was not innocent, which to me means that he did not sincerely believe this.</text>
            <text>And of course the jury was never given an opportunity--</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>No.</text>
            <text>What is required in this case, it's our position that, generally as the Court said in Bishop and Pomponio, that the Government must prove an intentional violation of a known legal duty, which is the gloss that the Court has put on the word willfully under the tax statutes.</text>
            <text>A known legal duty requires awareness of the duty.</text>
            <text>Here there's no question that Mr. Cheek was aware of his duty under the tax laws to file a return.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But the gloss... the gloss we put on it in Murdock is that quote, "an evil motive"... and evil motive...</text>
            <text>"is a constituent element of the crime."</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>Well, subsequently though, Justice Scalia, in Pomponio the Court described what it meant by the phrase evil motive in prior cases.</text>
            <text>What it meant... what it said was we meant by that nothing more than intentional violation of a known legal duty.</text>
            <text>And that was the precise question presented on Pomponio.</text>
            <text>So--</text>

            <text>I would like to say, though, that the tax seminars and what not that he says he attended were in 1980.</text>
            <text>From then on his submissions to the IRS and his legal arguments about the Sixteenth Amendment and other legal objections to the tax system appear... for all that appears to be self-generated and--</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>Well, it's... it's... it's one place in the case that I think it's useful, productive to focus upon.</text>
            <text>Known... the term knowledge as used in this Court's decision in Bailey and as the model penal code describes the word knowledge, it uses that in terms of awareness, cognition.</text>
            <text>Is the actor aware of the attendant circumstances, where the attendant circumstances that have to be shown are the state of the law, where, in this case the Internal Revenue Code requirements, awareness of what the Internal Revenue Code requires is an element of the offense.</text>
            <text>But once he is aware of what the law requires, but disagrees with, as I think it's only fair to say Mr. Cheek does in this case, disagrees with the code either because he thinks it is unconstitutional or because the IRS' construction of it is wrong, or--</text>

            <text>I understand he disagreed with whether the code... his position was that the code did not require it, despite what the courts had said, despite what the regulations said.</text>
            <text>He didn't think the code required that.</text>

            <text>--I understood him to be abandoning that as well, although I would like to point out that... that even the courts that have adopted the purely subject standard for claims to a belief that income... that a certain duty under the code is not required, it's purely subjective.</text>
            <text>Those courts have all said that a belief that the statute is unconstitutional is not a defense.</text>
            <text>And there is a statutory basis for that, because both 7201 and 7203 refer to evading titles imposed by this title, or failing to perform a duty required by this title, which suggests all you look to is the title... is the statute, rather than whether the Constitution might trump the statute.</text>

            <text>Well, I think it's... first of all, I think when... when that involves someone who was summoned to furnish information to the IRS, I think it's fair to attribute to Congress an intent to comply with the Fifth Amendment when a person is requested for information.</text>
            <text>And so whether a person has a duty... a duty to comply in those circumstances, I think there isn't a clash between the Fifth Amendment and the statute.</text>
            <text>The way you are claiming that the statute itself is unconstitutional in the sense that Congress didn't even have authority to enact it in the first place, I think that's... I think that's quite a different sort of claim.</text>

            <text>At some point taxpayers have to recognize that their disagreements with the IRS have become settled by this Court, or once again we would be encouraging disrespect not only for the Internal Revenue Code, but for... but for the judicial process.</text>
            <text>I would like to get back to a question Justice Scalia mentioned earlier, that Mr. Cheek has conceded that constitutional objections to the Internal Revenue Code are not... are not a sufficient basis for defense, but he had other objections.</text>
            <text>In fact his only other objection, as I understand it, was the claim that wages are not income.</text>
            <text>If you look at his testimony in this case, and as this argument has been presented in other cases, that is... that has also been presented as a constitutional argument, that wages involve an equal exchange of labor for compensation.</text>
            <text>There is no gain or profit, therefore it can't be taxed.</text>
            <text>It's in effect a tax of his property, which is a direct tax which can't be taxed under the Sixteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text>So even that argument, as it has traditionally been interpreted, or traditionally... traditionally been presented and as it has been presented by Mr. Cheek in this case, is at bottom a constitutional objection and falls in that same category.</text>
            <text>But there is another point I would like to make about that.</text>
            <text>Petitioner does not suggest that that argument is grounded in anything in the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text>The other aspects of his testimony in this case were based on his... on a set of beliefs that were not grounded in the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text>He referred to his... to his wages as property over which he had inalienable rights, citing and furnishing the IRS the Declaration of Independence.</text>
            <text>He had economic theories about equal exchanges of his labor for income.</text>
            <text>Those may be theories, those may be abstract beliefs, but they are not the sort of beliefs, as this Court made perfectly clear in Reynolds and--</text>

            <label>Mr. William R. Coulson</label>
            <text>Your Honor, the Government is taking the position that no one who possesses the belief that wages are not income can ever be not guilty.</text>
            <text>They are taking the position that it doesn't matter whether a lawyer tells you that, as happened in John Cheek's case, or an accountant tells you that.</text>
            <text>It wouldn't matter, because the Government says the content of that belief is on this forbidden list.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>I suppose the Government... wanted to add... provided you know the Government is going to disagree with you and enforce its laws and prosecute you.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_r_coulson">
            <label>Mr. William R. Coulson</label>
            <text>John Cheek had lawyers tell him that under the Internal Revenue Code wages were not income.</text>
            <text>Did he know his legal duty?</text>
            <text>Don't we want to encourage people to seek advice from lawyers and accountants on the tax laws?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Not from those lawyers.</text>
            <text>Well, I guess he had taken the issue to court in civil litigation and been told, hadn't he?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_r_coulson">
            <label>Mr. William R. Coulson</label>
            <text>The Government, I think, exaggerates the significance of that evidence.</text>
            <text>In any event, it is my position that that is a question for the jury.</text>
            <text>The jury is entitled to all of this information on what Cheek did and didn't do, and what he was told, and what he really understood and what he claimed he understood.</text>
            <text>That is an individualized jury determination which the Government seeks to take from the jury in this case and in all other cases, because Cheek's particular belief or misunderstanding is on this forbidden list.</text>
            <text>That makes no sense.</text>
            <text>If the Government is as confident, as Mr. Kneedler seems to be here, that Cheek is clearly guilty, he is clearly a sham, then why don't, why are they afraid to let a jury decide under the Murdock instruction?</text>
            <text>Why do they need the helping hand of Buckner-Cheek, which says the jury has to find that it's objectively reasonable.</text>
            <text>And under Buckner-Cheek that is a jury determination unless it is on the forbidden list.</text>
            <text>It makes no sense in jurisprudence.</text>
            <text>I am not abandoning this... I don't like the word abandon.</text>
            <text>I don't feel that I am abandoning the argument on its unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text>I don't think it is an issue in Mr. Cheek's case.</text>
            <text>He had all these crazy beliefs, wages are not income, the income tax is voluntary.</text>
            <text>To be sure, wrong beliefs.</text>
            <text>I am not here to defend those beliefs on the merits, but those are statutory beliefs.</text>
            <text>And he was told that that was the state of the law by attorneys at seminars, and he obviously is not a sophisticated man.</text>
            <text>And note, this Court and the Government cannot say that a person in Mr. Cheek's position as a matter of law could not have been mistaken.</text>
            <text>Yet that's the position the Government is urging.</text>
            <text>All we are asking is that Mr. Cheek be permitted to present that to a jury.</text>
            <text>If the jury thinks he is a phoney they will convict him.</text>
            <text>If they think he is sincere they should acquit him.</text>
            <text>And the Government can get its penalties and fines--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Which they are likely to think.</text>
            <text>I mean, they're more likely to think he is a phony if it's an unreasonable belief.</text>
            <text>I mean, you say, oh, come on, nobody--</text>

          <turn speaker="william_r_coulson">
            <label>Mr. William R. Coulson</label>
            <text>--Right.</text>
            <text>It's a factor the jury can consider, in addition to all the other factors, the genesis and so forth.</text>
            <text>A defendant like Cheek--</text>
