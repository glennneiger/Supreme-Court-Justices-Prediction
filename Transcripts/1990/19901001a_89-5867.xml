            <text syncTime="66.914" offset="400617">Looking to the plain meaning of the statute this has been a broad waiver of immunity and there... within in the statute itself is no clear jurisdictional language.</text>

            <text syncTime="86.818" offset="480239">With that in mind, this Court in Bowen, addressing the argument of whether or not 405(g) was a jurisdictional requisite cited that the traditional meaning of words applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.817" offset="548261">In that respect, Taylor v. the United States, 110 Supreme Court 2143, looked at the generic or contemporary meaning of words.</text>

            <text syncTime="588.157" offset="2485607">In the Hallstrom case, the language there was much more specific.</text>

            <text syncTime="593.480" offset="2506923">And you may not bring an action prior to 60-day notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.063" offset="2521238">That type of language is the type of language that if Congress had used it, we wouldn't be here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.596" offset="2543390">But the language as used has within, again, the meaning of the words used and within the intent of Congress, we submit, does show that equitable tolling was not to be specifically excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.934" offset="2600755">That had Congress intended such, they would have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.566" offset="2611203">Even in the legislative history of the 1972 amendments we don't find any language specifically addressing any prohibition upon the... the application of equitable tolling.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.506" offset="2663030">There's another fine distinction in the Bowen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.069" offset="2685287">In the Bowen case the statute there allowed the Secretary of the... I want to say Health, Education and Welfare... it's Health and Human Services... allowed a legal tolling in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.791" offset="2748085">That also is not a distinguishing factor here because even within Bowen, which had the legal tolling ability, still applied the equitable tolling principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.875" offset="2788418">And the... I submit that Bowen is applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.761" offset="2816003">An... an additional factor, too, that addressed the subject matter jurisdiction is that the cases that this Court has decided concerning administrative remedies and the application of equitable tolling there, I submit that the administrative exhaustion of remedies is certainly more central to subject matter jurisdiction being exercised by the district court than the filing period.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.936" offset="2924673">But in Bowen and in Zipes, Federal employee and private employee, in both of those situations, the exhaustion remedies has been held to be subject to equitable tolling.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.595" offset="2975350">I've gotten into my second point, that being of legislative intent to some degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.159" offset="2997607">And I might add that the 1972 amendments were enacted against the backdrop of cases that were liberally construing the remedial nature of the statute to protect the intended class and that the Federal employees were intended to have essentially the same rights as the private employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.113" offset="3073466">In that respect, too, the Federal Government should be the example for all of our society in the eradication of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.436" offset="3102723">It would... it would not be consistent in... I would submit it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.111" offset="3129368">It's not consistent with the overall purpose of the act to allow the Federal Government to... to not be subject to equitable tolling where there is, we submit, a broad waiver of immunity, where that would operate to preclude the intended class, where such would be in essence laying behind the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.536" offset="3223096">It just wasn't the intent of Congress in my... in my humble opinion to have that happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.669" offset="3247651">The legislative history again reveals that Congress had adopted the previous cases, both this Court's and the lower courts', concerning administrative exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.488" offset="3302926">Against that backdrop, Congress could have stated more specifically had they intended a nonwaiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.562" offset="3327168">The third basis is that of existing case law Zipes and Crown, Cork and Seal held that filing requirements for the private sector employees were subject to equitable tolling.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.664" offset="3383592">Albemarle Paper and Franks v. Bowman held that the administrative exhaustion was subject to equitable tolling.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.945" offset="3408774">And even the Seventh Circuit in the Federal employee arena has recently held in Rennie v. Garrett at 896 Fed. 2d 1057th that... and in that case they reverse Sims v. Heckler, held that the exhaustion of remedies was not a jurisdictional requirement for the Federal employee stating a finding of jurisdictional subjects the Federal employees to summary dismissal resulting from factual determinations made beyond the face of plaintiff's pleadings, a determination of which is prohibited in the private sector cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.686" offset="3527683">If Congress intended the Federal employees to be treated similarly and essentially the same as private employees, we would submit that that language should hold true and that the equitable tolling apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.513" offset="3578988">The language that I was looking for in the Bowen v. City of New York is that the accepting of the proposition, quoting this Court, however does not answer the question whether equitable tolling can be applied to the statute of limitations, for in construing the statute we must be careful not to assume the authority to narrow the waiver Congress intended or to construe the waiver unduly restrictively.</text>

            <text syncTime="1316.542" offset="5399096">Because in the very next regulation, 1613.282, Notice of Right to Sue, says an agency shall notify an employee or applicant of his right to file a civil action and of the 30-day time limit for filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.402" offset="5466596">None of that speaks to anything other than the claimant himself receiving actually notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.147" offset="5493555">And the... at the point of time of actual notice to the claimant is the point in time initiating the 30-day filing period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.704" offset="5535768">Now, we would concede one thing, that if the claimant does in fact designate his representative to receive actually notice and he does that in writing, which was not present in this case, specifically authorizing notice to be sent to his counsel of record, the actual notice then to the... to the attorney or the representative would indeed constitute actual notice in the initiation of the 30-day period.</text>

            <text syncTime="2375.788" offset="9636157">For example, in the Chandler case, the issue was what type of a trial do you get when you file your lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.315" offset="9666250">I don't think considerations of sovereign immunity were implicated there in terms of whether it was a trial de novo or administrative review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.819" offset="9696239">Here, however, the issue is whether the suit can be brought at all beyond the time period that Congress had specified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.125" offset="9725496">And their considerations of sovereign immunity are paramount, as they were in the Shaw case, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.887" offset="9748483">The court had previously held private parties were entitled to an award of interest on attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.990" offset="9772934">Congress intended to treat the United States like a private employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.022" offset="9785055">Therefore, the argument was made that United States should be liable for interests on attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.246" offset="9801982">The court rejected the parallel, noting that considerations of sovereign immunity, the no interest rule, required an express waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.800" offset="9832180">The same result in Brown v. GSA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.562" offset="9843256">The Court has previously held that title VII was not the exclusive remedy for private employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.998" offset="9872931">The argument was made Congress intended the United States to be treated like a private employer and rejected it, Justice Stewart noting for the Court that those private cases did not involve sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.054" offset="9917235">To cite just one more example, Lehman against Nakshian.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.687" offset="9931759">The Court had previously had held that under the Age Discrimination Act, private sector employees had a right to trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.660" offset="9955582">When Congress extended the protections of that act to Federal employees, modeled after title VII, it intended to treat Federal employees that same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.076" offset="9989228">Therefore, the argument was made that Federal employees should have a right to trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.378" offset="10002498">The Court rejected the argument, noting that sovereign immunity required an express waiver of the Government's immunity from jury trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2557.687" offset="10363719">But nothing in 2000e-5 authorizes the tolling of statute... statutes of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.582" offset="10391305">And, in fact, this would seem to be the one provision that you would not look to subsection 5 for, because there's a different provision here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2587.047" offset="10481166">Now, on the second question presented, the position of the United States is that the normal rule should apply and that notice to an attorney that one has designated to handle his affairs in a particular manner constitutes notice to the claimant himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2633.438" offset="10666740">This Court doesn't have to envision hypotheticals to understand how unworkable a rule would be that depended upon when the lawyer actually read the notice.</text>
