            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>

            <text syncTime="10.347" offset="115344">Four United States Marshals arrived at Thomas Braxton’s door with a warrant for his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.874" offset="141362">They knocked but there was no answer, though they could hear somebody inside.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.828" offset="157244">They got a key to the apartment, knocked again, unlocked the door, and finding it secured with a chain lock from the inside, kicked the door open.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.180" offset="194652">As it opened, the gunshot was fired and a bullet lodged in the door just above the doorknob,that is the outside of the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.324" offset="231223">The door slammed shut and the officers withdrew.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.360" offset="247315">A moment later, they again kicked the door open.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.002" offset="257973">Another shot was fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.226" offset="266854">This too, lodging in the front of the door about five feet from the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.835" offset="285244">The officers again withdrew and the area was barricaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.542" offset="296111">Braxton, who had fired the shots, eventually gave himself up and was charged in a three-count indictment with (1) an attempt to kill a deputy United States marshal, (2) assault on a deputy marshal, and (3) the use of a firearm during a crime of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.971" offset="373747">These were the facts presented by the government during the plea hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.663" offset="388585">Braxton agreed to those facts as the government presented them, and pleaded guilty to the last two charges, assault and firearm charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.715" offset="428813">He did not, however, plead guilty to the attempted murder charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.208" offset="442710">And his plea was not pursuant to any agreement with the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.810" offset="461205">Nonetheless, at sentencing, the District Court sentenced Braxton in effect as though he had pleaded guilty to attempted murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.322" offset="495164">Relying on a provision in the sentencing guidelines that allows the judge to sentence a defendant to an offense greater than the one to which he pleaded guilty, is the plea contains “a stipulation that specifically establishes a more serious offense than the offensive conviction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="125.424" offset="575622">The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the conviction here and we granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.811" offset="597146">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.683" offset="620657">While we have originally granted review in this case because of a split in the Circuits’ over the meaning of the word stipulation in the guideline provisions I quoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.769" offset="660990">We have chosen not to resolve the case on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.645" offset="676454">After we granted review, the sentencing commission began an amendment process that could lead to a clarification of the guideline on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.136" offset="714488">In our view, the commission is Congress’ chosen body for resolving splits in the interpretation of the guidelines, and we will differ to it here where we can resolve the case on another ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.695" offset="756702">Even if an agreement to facts presented at a plea hearing constitutes a stipulation, we do not believe that the stipulation in this case specifically establishes which is what the guideline requires, specifically establishes that Braxton attempted to murder anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.747" offset="824934">At best, the stipulation is ambiguous if the bullets hit the door as described, that is lodged in the front of an inward-opening door, it would not be reasonable to conclude that Braxton was shooting at the marshals unless it was also stipulated that the marshals had entered the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.467" offset="887733">That was not stipulated, and even if it was, that would still not show that Braxton had shot at the marshals with the intent of killing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.504" offset="919915">Not only is there nothing from which that essential element could be inferred, but Braxton explicitly denied it at the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.300" offset="947083">He claims to have intended only to frighten the martials and that is perfectly consistent with his stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.877" offset="969444">To constitute a stipulation that specifically establishes an intent to kill something more than what we have here is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.054" offset="998178">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.700" offset="1008732">Our opinion is unanimous.</text>
