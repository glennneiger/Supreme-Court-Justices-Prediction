            <text syncTime="20.316" offset="218309">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="23.958" offset="232937">The issue before the Court today is the validity under title VII of a policy that bans from lead-exposed jobs because of fetal health concerns any woman who cannot provide medical evidence that she is physically incapable of bearing a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.947" offset="292810">The policy applies regardless of the woman's age, marital status, the fertility of her spouse, her intent to have a child, her use of contraception, and how careful she is in using the hygiene practices that the company has prescribed and which, according to the company, should keep blood lead levels if properly used below the level safe for fetuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.813" offset="380372">And the company applies this policy as well despite evidence that lead at the same levels, blood lead levels, produces in men reproductive injury, including infertility, and produces in people generally cardiovascular disease and neurological harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.716" offset="455918">Our position is that this policy violates title VII because it explicitly and broadly excludes women and, as such, violates... basic title VII principles and because for three independent reasons the policy does not come within the only available defense under title VII, the defense that this Court has called the narrowest of exceptions in Dothard v. Rawlinson, section 703(e), the bona fide occupational qualification defense, known as the BFOQ defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.993" offset="577022">First, the policy that Johnson Controls is seeking to justify today is fundamentally inconsistent with the basic precepts and principles of title VII, especially as title VII was amended in 1978 by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.626" offset="643582">This Court stated emphatically in a number of cases, including the City of Los Angeles v. Manhart, Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins last term, Arizona Governing Committee v. Norris, that an employer cannot disadvantaged a woman simply because of her membership in the group of women... because she is a woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.328" offset="730413">And here, the overwhelming number of the women who are being excluded because of the policy at issue present no risk to the health of any child either because they have no intention to have a child or any more children, or because they will delay having children until they are safely removed or out of lead-exposed job, or because they will keep their lead levels down, blood lead levels down through efficient hygiene.</text>

            <text syncTime="240.544" offset="1099262">In addition, though, and quite importantly, I don't think this is a case in which the most extreme hypothetical should determine the issue before the Court in this... for the following reasons:</text>
            <text syncTime="251.951" offset="1144924">First of all, a pregnancy-limited policy would be... could be devised in a way that is nondiscriminatory in the first place because if the employer treated pregnancy-related harms similarly to other temporary instances of hypersusceptibility, one might have a nondiscriminatory policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="533.209" offset="2269861">In any event, the purpose of title VII and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act was to prevent practices that, in the words of Senator Williams, a chief proponent of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act,</text>
            <text syncTime="544.666" offset="2315732">"because she might become pregnant, relegate women in general to a second-class status with regard to career advancement and continuity of employment and wages, render women marginal workers and oust them from the workplace. "</text>
            <text syncTime="557.535" offset="2367246">The fetal-risk policies of this kind... that is, those that apply to all fertile women... if upheld, would keep women from a broad range of jobs because there are, in fact, a broad range of jobs that present potential fetal risks due to toxics, but also due to disease, stress, noise, radiation, and also to ordinary physical accidents, like car accidents, falls, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.294" offset="2470273">One example of this is that there was a recent study which showed that doctors have four times the prematurity rate... women doctors... of other women, and as we understand the arguments that Johnson Controls is making today, that might well be sufficient... studies of those kind... to ban women from being doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.236" offset="2542057">The net effect of upholding a policy of this type, therefore, would be to sanction the resegregation of the work force, particularly because the economics of the situation are that employers are going to instill fetal protection policies in instances in which they are not dependent on women workers for their work force and not instigate them where they are highly dependent on women workers, because then they would have nobody to do the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.304" offset="2658250">So the effect is that women will end up in the jobs where they began before title VII was passed... that is, in child care centers, hospital nurses, teachers... not because there are fewer fetal risks in those jobs but because those are the jobs in which they are indispensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.275" offset="2714152">The net effect is that this policy, if upheld, would cut the heart out of title VII and out of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.659" offset="2743722">The question, then, is whether Congress intended to nonetheless allow employers to pursue policies of this kind within the language of the bona fide occupation qualification exception which reads very narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.768" offset="2804118">It says that it applies in those certain instances in which sex is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of a particular business.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.036" offset="2845182">Johnson Controls argues that despite this extraordinarily narrow language and the vast damage done to title VII, this has to be a BFOQ, because otherwise one couldn't protect fetal health.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.163" offset="2889695">I will proceed in a moment to outline the three reasons why we think that that is simply wrong, but first I'd like to respond briefly to the emotional content of Johnson Controls' argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.301" offset="2930237">That is, by placing this case in its real context as part of the social problem of protecting fetal health.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.938" offset="2964823">First of all, the issue of fetal health is far more complicated than the employer admits.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.041" offset="2985198">To understand why, let's consider two possible scenarios.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.252" offset="3002126">First of all, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act history demonstrates that women work because they have to, and it demonstrates as well and emphatically, and this was discussed at some length on the floor and also in the hearings, that there is a major danger to fetal health due to maternal poverty and also due to an inability of women to have prenatal care if they're unemployed, and that those dangers are similar to the sorts of dangers Johnson Controls is claiming here.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.455" offset="3134932">They are dangers of retardation, neurological damage, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.328" offset="3150397">If many employers adopt fetal protection policies, as I've suggested they might if Johnson Controls' principles were upheld here today, the net result will be that many women will not have adequate income and will be relegating their children to precisely those fetal harms which Congress was in fact trying to prevent in passing the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.585" offset="3247363">The other possibility is that many... some employers protect these... won't institute fetal protection policies for reasons of the sort I alluded to earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.370" offset="3282576">That is, because they are the employers who are dependent on female workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.503" offset="3299086">If that happens, women may have jobs in those workplaces, but they are traditionally lower paid, and also they do not necessarily have lesser fetal risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.281" offset="3338165">They simply have different fetal risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.524" offset="3347151">A related point about the social context of this case, or the larger context of this case, is that the issue here really, therefore, is not whether fetal health is going to be protected, but how and by whom.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.364" offset="3406501">Obviously, an employer is welcome and ought to be protecting fetal health to the highest degree possible, as long as he doesn't exclude women from the workplace, but in addition, there are two other decision makers here.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.261" offset="3454149">There's the woman, and there's the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.134" offset="3461567">The Government in this instance, in OSHA... the Occupational Safety and Health Administration... deciding the lead standard in 1978 emphatically decided, under its own statute... section 38 of its own statute... that it is not reasonably necessary for employers to exclude all fertile women from the workplace because of occupational safety and health concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.212" offset="3573894">Interestingly, note that the language of OSHA is the same... section 38 of OSHA... as the BFOQ: reasonably necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.837" offset="3600434">So what OSHA decided is really exactly the same issue that is before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.590" offset="3619451">OSHA decided that it is not reasonably necessary to have an exclusion of this kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="988.616" offset="4091536">What... the proposition that the employer, as I understand it, is putting before the Court on the liability or legal duty question, is that it could be held liable strictly for employing the woman in a lead-exposed job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.174" offset="4145767">I mean, I assume we would all agree that if they were... actually negligent in how lead was controlled in the workplace, or gave inadequate warnings, that title VII should not protect them, and therefore the only possibility is that they are being... could be held liable simply from hiring the woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.156" offset="4209714">That is... so they are positing a State rule that they may not hire women in this job.</text>

J.R., places in the hands of parents the responsibility to save their children from risk, recognizing that sometimes... occasionally they will make mistakes, but that if they do make mistakes or if a problem develops along that way, one does not put in the hands of a private individual the decision whether they ought to be overridden.</text>

            <text syncTime="1913.148" offset="7789639">Well, Justice Scalia, with all due respect, I disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.540" offset="7799252">I think clearly the Pregnancy Discrimination Act took care of such concerns as benefits, it took care of such concerns that were raised in this Court's Gilbert decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.845" offset="7832480">But I think it's clear that the Pregnancy Discrimination Act was not intended to overrule the other defenses and the existing analysis contained in title VII, the legislative history, indicates that there's nothing in the language that indicates otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.056" offset="7897264">The Pregnancy Discrimination Act is an amendment to the definition of sex discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.249" offset="7918057">It certainly... it excludes some specific affirmative defenses involving the Equal Pay Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.823" offset="7936343">It has no exclusion in its language for the bona fide occupational qualification defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.748" offset="7960062">To take such an approach as is taken by petitioners here and as is suggested by Judge Easterbrook in effect says that an employer can never exclude a woman based upon her pregnancy, no matter how dangerous it is to her fetus, that that woman has the absolute right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.089" offset="8025473">Because the legal analysis if one accepts that position is that even... for example, in a nuclear power plant if there were a room or an... a specific area where the radiation through medical evidence is clear that it's safe for adults and not for the fetus and you have a woman who is pregnant, the employer under that analysis would be precluded from denying that woman that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.366" offset="8126514">It would be odd, in fact, for the Pregnancy Discrimination Act to be treated... to be interpreted in such a manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.329" offset="8150338">One of the purposes of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act was fetal health.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.593" offset="8167474">The legislative history is replete with the concern for fetal health.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.726" offset="8183984">To interpret that act as requiring an employer to knowingly expose the offspring of its employees to injury, permanent injury to the central nervous system, would be contrary to that intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.953" offset="8236856">Moreover, that same Pregnancy Discrimination Act specifically states that an employer shall not be required to pay for an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.409" offset="8270710">Now, if Congress went out of its way to say the employer shouldn't be required to pay for an abortion, it wasn't also saying that the employer should be required to injure the child.</text>

            <text syncTime="3135.537" offset="12679239">First of all, we certainly do not concede that the brisk comparison here was done properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.495" offset="12715079">The... our contention is that in order to adequately assess the risk involved, one has to look at the class of people who are being excluded and not simply the question of whether, if there are actual fetuses, which is what we were talking about when we said there was a substantial risk, is... is injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.658" offset="12799716">In other words, while we did agree that the kind of injury to fetuses as to actually pregnant women if the risk occurred was substantial, and we certainly did not concede that looking at fertile women as a whole, the likelihood that any injury would actually occur would be any greater than the level of adult risk accepted in the workplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.217" offset="12909953">And in answer to Justice Scalia's questions about how one should tell how much risk is enough, we suggest that the best test is what does the employer normally accept in the workplace as to health risks generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.977" offset="12968989">That comparative standard is not factored into the test that was applied by the court of appeals here to the test... or to the test that the company here suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.393" offset="13006606">In other words, there is absolutely nothing in this record to indicate that adult risks are being perfectly protected, but the company is insisting on perfectly protecting fetal risks.</text>

            <text syncTime="3354.419" offset="13554759">I was going to say that the... so on the one hand, this... the standard which Johnson Controls is arguing does not factor in any comparative risk notion or any reason why an employer cannot insist upon perfect protection for fetal health while not protecting adult health perfectly, not to say adequately, but not perfectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.727" offset="13656010">There is... and contrary to what the company has been suggesting, here there is clear evidence in the record of cardiovascular dangers, neurological dangers and male fertility dangers... which, by the way, are conceded... with respect to adult health, and those are not being perfectly protected against.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.477" offset="13722988">In addition, this policy fails for another reason, which is that it does not... it excludes a class all or substantially all of whom are not within the group that actually presents the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.188" offset="13777845">Criswell doesn't apply here or, if applied here, leads to an opposite conclusion, not for the reason that Mr. Jaspan suggested but because this is not a situation in which it is impossible to individualize the risk assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.376" offset="13834583">It's just impossible for the employer to individualize the risk assessment because the employer doesn't want to ask the private questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.591" offset="13855481">The woman, herself, knows what her situation is, and, therefore, we're not dealing, as I said before, with a biological fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.536" offset="13887246">We're dealing with a behavioral fact which cannot be presumed against the woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.219" offset="13901979">In addition and connected to that is that the extreme case hypothetical which Mr. Jaspan suggested assumes that if one went to an actually pregnant woman in a nuclear power plant and said the following five things are going to happen to you if you stay in this workplace and also, for example, provided her with another comparable job that she would stay there, there is absolutely no basis for that; and in any event, if there is one woman like that in the world, we are talking about an extremely minuscule risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.468" offset="14014932">In addition and again related, Mr. Jaspan suggests that this company tried that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.213" offset="14037920">Well, the fact is the company didn't try it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.293" offset="14046279">Justice Posner said in his dissent below that the warning that the company gave to women was more likely to allay than to arouse concern.</text>
