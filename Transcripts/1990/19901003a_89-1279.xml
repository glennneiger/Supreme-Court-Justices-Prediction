            <text syncTime="10.218" offset="171612">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.212" offset="183523">This matter is here on writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the Alabama Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.375" offset="204212">That judgment affirmed and awarded punitive damages against the Petitioner, Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company, on a respondeat superior basis for fraud committed by a sales agent in collecting and pocketing premiums from a policy of group health insurance issued by another carrier, Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company, and also on individual policies of life insurance issued by Pacific Mutual.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.732" offset="317584">The insurance was issued to cover employees of the City of Roosevelt, which is a small town in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.219" offset="347572">During the course of the trial, all counts asserted by plaintiffs alleging any wrongdoing against Pacific Mutual directly were dismissed and abandoned, so that the sole basis of the award was respondeat superior, or the fraud of the agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.291" offset="427820">The major portion of the award went to Mrs. Haslip because she incurred medical expenses during a period which would have been covered by the Union Fidelity policy had the agent not misappropriated the premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.260" offset="483723">She was apparently unable to pay the hospital expenses, and a judgment was entered against her.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.444" offset="508487">And that appears to explain the great disparity in the award that went to her, and the relatively nominal awards that went to the other plaintiffs.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bruce A. Beckman</label>
            <text syncTime="109.484" offset="568673">Justice O'Connor, under Alabama law, the punitive damage award to Mrs. Haslip would have been at least $840,000, because the maximum... she had a prayer for $3 million of punitive damages, and a prayer for her actual damages, plus emotional distress damages of $200,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.151" offset="667311">The award to her was $1,040,000, so that if we assumed that she got the full general, actual, economic damages, and emotional distress damages, for which she prayed, the punitive award still would have been at least $840,000, and that would have been the computation under Alabama law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1006.452" offset="4156539">And the second Hammond factor is to consider the reprehensibility of the conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1608.543" offset="6564924">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.148" offset="6595331">Alabama provides two levels of protection for defendants facing the possibility of punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.974" offset="6630648">First, the jury sets the award pursuant to the traditional common law standards, then, trial and appellate courts independently reassess the award pursuant to even more protective standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.377" offset="6696163">Let me talk first about the jury instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.489" offset="6704627">The jury was instructed, with respect to the State's purpose in punitive damage awards, that they are to punish and deter, that they are not to compensate the plaintiff, or not to be a windfall to the plaintiff, and the jury was instructed that the amount of the award must be tailored to the character and the degree of the wrong as shown by the evidence in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.665" offset="6805355">Pacific Mutual did not object to those common law instructions at the trial, and did not request any more specific instructions at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.492" offset="6844643">Those common law standards, by themselves, certainly satisfy traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.367" offset="6880170">They have been used and approved by courts throughout the land for 200 years, and no court has ever found them violative of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.995" offset="6914652">Despite enormous pressure on State legislatures and Congress in the past 15 years, those are still the standards that are used in nearly every State today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.911" offset="6958328">These standards, as the Court recognized in Day v. Woodworth, were well established before the due process clause was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.028" offset="6994795">In fact, in another Alabama case, Louis Pizitz, decided by this Court in 1927, this Court upheld those very common law standards and unanimously rejected precisely the same due process challenge Pacific Mutual is raising again... that these common law standards gave the jury "unbridled discretion" to fix the punitive amount</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.512" offset="7092702">"without any method of ascertainment and without any limit to the amount it may impose. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.067" offset="7118929">That argument was rejected unanimously in Pizitz.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.419" offset="7132408">Earlier, in Standard Oil v. Missouri, this Court also upheld against due process attack a punitive fine where there were no standards for determining the amount and no maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.808" offset="7181936">That was a State antitrust fine, but the Court relied for its decision expressly on the analogy to punitive damage proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.824" offset="7217985">I think that there is simply no anchor in the text of the due process clause, and there is certainly no established societal norm from which the Court could define or develop new standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.797" offset="7297920">In this circumstance, where these standards have been used and thought to be fair for over 200 years, and where, even today, Pacific Mutual does not suggest specific standards for determining what is the right amount, merely a cap on whatever amount is awarded--</text>

            <text syncTime="1861.646" offset="7577326">Well, Justice O'Connor, I think not, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.259" offset="7587775">First, this Court's due process decisions in the past have always applied with respect to clarity in the conduct that can trigger a punishment of any type.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.077" offset="7627063">There must be clear notice of the conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.491" offset="7636676">That was certainly true in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.311" offset="7643990">Pacific Mutual was punished for intentional fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.072" offset="7654962">There is no claim that the conduct at issue in this case was vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.066" offset="7670949">Second, even in the case of capital punishment, in the McGautha decision, this Court ruled that the due process clause does not require more specific standards for determining the sentence of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.768" offset="7729776">In that case, the jury was instructed that it had</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.341" offset="7740016">"absolute discretion to decide whether to sentence to death or not. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.746" offset="7761646">and there was absolutely no legislative or judicial guidance as to whether to impose that penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.681" offset="7781394">The Court decided that, as a matter of due process, that did not violate the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.596" offset="7801038">The next year, in Furman, the Court, of course, did decide under the higher, more rigorous standards of the Eighth Amendment, that capital cases do require guided discretion, but the due process clause does not, as this Court ruled in Pizitz, and ruled in Standard Oil v. Missouri.</text>

            <text syncTime="2828.395" offset="11444284">In a recent case, for example, the Alabama Supreme Court noted that the degree of the wrongdoing was sufficient to merit a punitive award by itself, but noted, as the jury does not know, that that same defendant had been hit with a punitive award in another case, and therefore decided that it was not necessary to have a second punitive award against the defendant for the same conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.250" offset="11543654">That would not rationally further the State's objectives, and so it set aside the punitive award entirely, based upon that factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.425" offset="11572389">The Alabama Supreme Court does the same thing with respect to comparability reviews.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.740" offset="11589629">It says to itself, all right, here's another insurance bad faith case and a punitive award was set at this amount; we have had seven of these insurance bad faith cases in the past 3 years, and here is what seems to be a reasonable range of punishment in these cases; we think this one exceeds that reasonable range, and reduces it accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.473" offset="11664549">It is not a standard of review that simply rubber-stamps the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2889.587" offset="11689104">In Alabama, I think, unlike any other State of which I'm aware, there is a right for a post-verdict evidentiary hearing at which the defendant can present new evidence that was never presented to the jury in... in support of reducing the punitive award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.328" offset="11755977">The defendant can come in and say, the award should be reduced because I am quite poor, and this would absolutely bankrupt me and cripple me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.874" offset="11786175">The defendant can come in and say, the award should be reduced because I have already been subjected to a criminal fine for similar conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.761" offset="11809789">That kind of information would be extremely prejudicial to a jury... for a jury to hear at the liability phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.805" offset="11833927">But Alabama courts give the defendant an evidentiary opportunity to present all relevant evidence, and then, based on that evidence, the courts independently reassess.</text>

            <text syncTime="3089.828" offset="12490018">Well, let me... let me turn to that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.237" offset="12495660">First, Pacific Mutual's argument on vicarious liability is that there must... constitutionally, there must be some element of benefit to the principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.276" offset="12539860">First, that issue is not before the Court, because at the trial level and in the Alabama Supreme Court level, Pacific Mutual never argued that benefit is a constitutional requirement for vicarious liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.254" offset="12587716">It's argument was on quite different grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.644" offset="12597329">Furthermore, this would be a very inappropriate case to consider that, because indisputably in this case, there was economic benefit to Pacific Mutual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.750" offset="12629721">There were at least 3 months of premiums on life insurance policies that Pacific Mutual received and never refunded as a result of these frauds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.786" offset="12665874">But turning to the merits of that vicarious liability argument, in both punitive damages cases and antitrust cases and even in criminal cases, this Court has expressly approved vicarious liability without either fault by the principal or benefit to the principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.038" offset="12738808">Again, in the Pizitz case, decided unanimously in 1927, the Court squarely ruled that Alabama, the same system we're talking about here, could impose vicarious liability for punitive damages without fault by the principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.657" offset="12797323">That was a unanimous ruling of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.919" offset="12806413">In the Hydro-level case, this Court even went so far as to adopt as rational and wise social policy a rule of vicarious liability for Federal antitrust cases that is indistinguishable from the Alabama rule at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.411" offset="12864300">In Hydro-level, this Court ruled that, under the antitrust laws, a principal can be held vicariously liable for antitrust violations by an agent even if the principal was not at all at fault, and even if the principal did not benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.452" offset="12928562">Now, I know that some justices of this Court dissented from Hydro-level and did not think that was the wisest or most rational... the best policy choice, but the fact that the Court as a Court reached that conclusion shows that that decision is at least a rational judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.133" offset="12991256">Alabama has made that rational judgment, and it should be upheld.</text>

            <text syncTime="3233.347" offset="13064085">Even in criminal cases, this Court has upheld vicarious criminal liability without fault or benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.443" offset="13100447">In the Park and Daughterwite cases, the Court even went so far as to rule that an individual officer of a company can be held criminally liable on vicarious liability principles for the wrongdoing of an agent of which the principal was not aware, and from which the principal did not benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.667" offset="13169411">It seems to me to follow a fortiori that if vicarious liability is appropriate even in that criminal context, it is appropriate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.011" offset="13198772">Let me simply conclude, since my time is almost to expire, by saying that the principal issue here I think is the standards issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.607" offset="13237120">I think that Alabama has developed a rational system for achieving legitimate and very important State objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.533" offset="13264810">Alabama provides substantially more protection than the common law standards that were well established when the due process clause was adopted and that are still the prevailing standards today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.451" offset="13308487">This Court should not expand upon that traditional understanding of due process and throw settled State tort law into complete disarray without compelling evidence that the punitive damage awards are fundamentally unfair in the majority of cases, and without compelling reason to believe that the legislative process is closed or is incapable of addressing that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.446" offset="13400438">There does not have to be a constitutional remedy for every social problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.839" offset="13422067">In this case, I think this is a paradigmatic case for judicial restraint, not judicial activism.</text>

            <text syncTime="3335.238" offset="13471700">The jury instruction in this case, and the common law jury instruction in Alabama really left the jury entirely to its own internal resources in deciding whether or not to punish and, if so, how much.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.980" offset="13558635">It was recognized rather forthrightly by Justice Houston of the Alabama Supreme Court in a subsequent decision to ours that that instruction was incomprehensibly vague and incomprehensible as a gauge for the jury to use in measuring the amount of a punitive award.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.254" offset="13627703">And he noted the consequences of that vagueness in two recent cases that had come before the Alabama Supreme Court, where he found the facts to be identical and the jury instructions to be identical, and in fact identical to the instruction here, and in one the jury came in with an award of $2,500,000, and in the other, $21,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.618" offset="13717146">In the jury room when the question came up, shall we punish Pacific Mutual for the agent's fraud, all it had to go on was its own notions of right and wrong or whether or no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.469" offset="13788617">All it was told by Alabama law was that you have discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.422" offset="13804395">You can if you want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.344" offset="13808052">Similarly, when it had decided to make the award and say, we're going to punish Pacific Mutual for the agent's fraud, how much should we award, all the instructions told them was, you've got discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.330" offset="13852043">It's any amount you want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.943" offset="13858521">I suggest that that is exactly the arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement that due process condemns, and would respond... in response to Respondent's contention that due process requires no notice of penalty, I'd suggest that that's a rather crabbed and narrow view of due process, and prior decisions of this Court have held that the fair notice portions... concerns of the ex post facto clauses are included within the concept of fundamental fairness included in the due process clauses of both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
