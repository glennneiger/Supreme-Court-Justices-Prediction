            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73981">I have the opinions of the Court to announce in two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4.016" offset="89968">The first of them is 89-1322, Oklahoma Tax Commission versus the Citizen Band of Potawatomi Indian Tribe of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.346" offset="127271">The case comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.688" offset="140645">It arose out of a dispute between the State and the Tribe over the latter's obligation to collect taxes on cigarettes sold on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.110" offset="178366">The Court of Appeals held that the Tribe was immune from suit under this Court's doctrine of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.787" offset="205116">Therefore, it ruled that Oklahoma's counterclaims were properly dismissed, and that Oklahoma could not require the Tribe to collect and remit taxes on cigarette sales that occur on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.026" offset="254017">In a decision filed today with the Clerk, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.458" offset="271780">We find that the Tribe did not wave its sovereign immunity from suit merely by seeking an injunction against the proposed assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.750" offset="304903">We affirm that part of the Court of Appeals' decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.233" offset="318905">However, as we have stated in several prior cases, sovereign immunity does not deprive a state of the authority to tax cigarette sales to non-members of a tribe at a tribal store.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.528" offset="364045">In two prior decisions, we have held that the tribe has an obligation to assist in the collection of validly imposed state taxes on such sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.883" offset="397481">We, therefore, reverse that portion of the Court of Appeals' opinion that enjoins Oklahoma from collecting taxes on sales to non-members of the Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.263" offset="431023">Justice Stevens has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
