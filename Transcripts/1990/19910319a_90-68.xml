            <text syncTime="134.540" offset="669850">He then appealed to the Ninth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="152.011" offset="739754">It was in the context of divining the unspoken intent underlying a 7-page State court opinion that in Harris against Reed the Court held that a procedural default would not bar consideration of a Federal claim either on direct or Federal habeas review unless the last State court rendering judgment clearly and expressly stated that its decision rested on a State procedural bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.360" offset="853126">So the holding of Harris appeared to apply only when it was unclear whether in fact the last State court to write an opinion had invoked a State procedural rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.606" offset="890115">And in Harris the last State court wrote an opinion, an opinion expressly deciding the Federal question, but no State court in Harris clearly claimed a procedural default.</text>

            <text syncTime="241.359" offset="1097109">And so you can't say flatly that a denial of the writ is based on procedural grounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="260.904" offset="1175268">And it then holds that the judgment, that the California Supreme Court summary denial is a judgment under Harris, without reference to State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.861" offset="1223124">It declined to look beyond the four corners of the California Supreme Court's order denying the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.404" offset="1249246">And it, like Harris, did not distinguish between the exercise of a State's court's mandatory and discretionary jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.331" offset="1288952">Now, on its face the Ninth Circuit seems to say that Harris disposes of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.055" offset="1311940">And I think that that view is reinforced by the fact that the Ninth Circuit unnecessarily raised the question as to whether or not a petition for review, not... that is addressed to the State supreme court's discretionary appellate jurisdiction in a habeas corpus case, if it were summarily denied might not be a judgment within the Harris rule also.</text>

            <text syncTime="365.891" offset="1595212">Here California is asking that its State supreme court have the right to decide when to write its opinions, not how to write them.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.867" offset="1631157">And the complementary Federal interest in Harris was in relieving Federal courts of the somewhat impossible task of deciphering all those ambiguous opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.483" offset="1665638">In this case, however, California simply asked that the Federal court correctly interpret California law, and that once that is done that that interpretation will inform all Federal subsequent litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.493" offset="1725615">Now, it may be that the Ninth Circuit's reading of Harris was reinforced by its longstanding misapprehension of California law, namely that the California Supreme Court's habeas jurisdiction, because it is original, must be mandatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1301.937" offset="5339395">In all candor, however, I find it difficult to assign a great deal of importance to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.112" offset="5372100">And the reason is that the California Supreme Court has not perceptibly altered its practice since Harris against Reed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.059" offset="5403865">In noncapital cases... capital cases are different because the State Supreme court has mandatory appellate jurisdiction, and under its rules consolidates habeas corpus proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.084" offset="5443989">And so in those cases they will claim procedural default.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.207" offset="5452453">They will use the words "procedural default".</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.137" offset="5460185">They have not done so in any noncapital case, and in 1989 denied 550... gave 550 summary denials and about 648 in 1990.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.456" offset="5509504">They are not going to change their practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.535" offset="5513788">And I think the reason for it is that it would put an enormous burden on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.889" offset="5531238">I mean, it's one thing to cite State cases, as they do... Swain, Linley, Dexter... because those cases show defects apparent from the face of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.857" offset="5571153">Defects not in the procedure below but in the petition itself, such as not stating a prima facie case or raising a question of Fourth Amendment law, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.672" offset="5614412">Our State courts anticipated Stone v. Powell in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.644" offset="5626219">Those are principles that are fairly non-controversial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.026" offset="5643774">They don't require a lot of time to apply, not much judge time involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.220" offset="5660597">Those orders do not even relate to individual claims, and many of the petitions present up to 16 or more claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.985" offset="5687659">So there is not much time involved... de minimus drafting time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.926" offset="5703333">Those are easy orders to write.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.099" offset="5716081">On the other hand, for the State supreme court to claim a procedural default is pretty onerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.622" offset="5738128">The Ninth Circuit itself in Bachelor against Cup pointed out that most times it's more difficult to decide the procedural default question than the underlying merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.398" offset="5769266">Now, what the Ninth Circuit is asking is that the California Supreme Court look at this petition and then determine whether there has been exhaustion, whether there has been a claim of a procedural default, whether the State rules vindicates legitimate interest, whether it has been even-handedly applied, whether it is truly independent of Federal law, and whether there has been a waiver of that default, or whether it is cause and prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.178" offset="5876368">I mean, this is an enormous burden on a court whose docket approaches this Court's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.241" offset="5896639">They simply can't do it, which is why they haven't done what the Ninth Circuit wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.043" offset="5911895">As a matter of fact, the Ninth Circuit has given the Supreme Court of California an ultimatum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.695" offset="5926419">It says you have three choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.946" offset="5931434">Either continue your summary denial process and we'll view it as a ruling on the merits, and then you will undermine the integrity of your State procedural rules and the finality of your judgments, or do all this work that I have just been describing, adding at least 650 cases a year to your caseload.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.036" offset="5995800">And that doesn't include the never-ending stream of petitions as predicted by the Harris dissent that will result by guys who will... prisoners who will keep petitioning until they get a suitably ambiguous--</text>

            <text syncTime="1613.745" offset="6586690">But it's not easy to tell everything that they do, because these are basically ex parte proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.986" offset="6603617">Outside of a capital case, we are rarely asked to respond to a habeas corpus petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.120" offset="6628172">And so there is nobody there on behalf of the State to urge procedural default.</text>

            <text syncTime="1632.025" offset="6659728">Not only that, but the prototypical cause for excusing default is competency of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.671" offset="6694314">So now they're going to have to decide... the State court will have to decide the merits of the competency claim in order to decide whether to waive the procedural default.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.137" offset="6724198">And there's an enormous burden being asked here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.660" offset="6738304">Now, they have to... they either have to do that, accept the Ninth Circuit's rule, or renounce their original habeas corpus jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.104" offset="6772055">If they do that, they can escape the Ninth Circuit's rule, because essentially that's what happened in Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.996" offset="6791699">And we don't think that comity should force the court to amend... the State to amend its own constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.231" offset="6816567">However, the court may get a little assistance from the electorate in that respect because on the 28th of January of this year assembly constitutional amendment 10 was introduced in the State assembly.</text>

            <text syncTime="1768.705" offset="7206523">In reviewing the Harris v. Reed oral argument transcript, I noted that justices specifically asked questions regarding a silent denial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1841.562" offset="7497945">Well, first of all... the question here should be what kind of discretion is exercised by the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.618" offset="7534099">I would note, first of all, that this Court is in a very different position than the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.502" offset="7553638">You are, after all, the Court of last resort, and after you rule, that's it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.684" offset="7570461">The California Supreme Court knows that when it denies a Federal... excuse me, a State habease petition, that more than likely that petitioner will move on to Federal court, and what the supreme court does is relevant as to what is going to happen next.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.014" offset="7631692">Second of all, as to the burden, the State seems to argue here that its position would not apply on death penalty cases, so we are not talking about the cases that are the most troublesome to the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.077" offset="7703999">And so no burden would be lessened there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.037" offset="7711836">In fact, when you look at the statutes in California, I would first state that this pamphlet relied upon is simply a pamphlet that is given to the public in the most basic terms to explain what the California Supreme Court does, and it is not signed... the introduction in fact is signed by Justice Lucas, but it is not signed by any other justice and we do not know if in fact the other justices agree with this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1967.956" offset="8003467">But it's also true that the two procedures are treated totally differently in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.629" offset="8026141">First of all, the California Supreme Court has a separate section of lawyers, researchers, to deal only with petitions for habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.979" offset="8083610">Griggs v. Superior Court very clearly states that when a petition for habeas corpus is filed in the California Supreme Court the merits have to be looked at.</text>

            <text syncTime="2061.068" offset="8375973">And what the court is doing there is simply reviewing the opinion from the court of appeal to determine if a hearing, if review is proper.</text>

            <text syncTime="3385.440" offset="13928665">Your Honor, the district court did not send Mr. Nunnemaker back to the State courts because it could not figure out what they were up to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.362" offset="13928561">It couldn't understand what Mr. Nunnemaker was up to, because, as indicated at page 83 of the joint appendix, he came to the district court and said I have raised none of my claims on direct appeal in the State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.201" offset="13928456">That's why it was sent back for exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.783" offset="13928352">The respondent says what burden does footnote 12 impose on the State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.606" offset="13928247">I'd like to give an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.788" offset="13928143">The Ninth Circuit's rule doesn't simply require an unequivocal claim of default by the last State court rendering judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.474" offset="13928038">It has to do it in the last order it enters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.233" offset="13927934">So the California Supreme Court granted a hearing, claimed a default, and then came upon the case again on collateral attack, on habeas review, and issued a summary denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.929" offset="13927829">The Ninth Circuit would hold, under its interpretation of footnote 12, that they had waived the default they claimed in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.104" offset="13927725">Why any court would do that is inexplicable to me, but I would like to point out that it... that that's quite contrary to the assurance given in Harris that a State court need do no more to preclude Federal review on habeas than it need do on direct review.</text>
