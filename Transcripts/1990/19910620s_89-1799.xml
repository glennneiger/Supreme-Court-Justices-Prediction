            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="74089">The opinion of the Court in No. 89-1799, Masson against New Yorker Magazine will be announced by Justice Kennedy.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="9.639" offset="112541">This case, Masson versus New Yorker Magazine comes before us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.511" offset="144097">Jeffrey Masson was a scholar who turned to the study of psychoanalysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.868" offset="161547">He became project's director on the staff of the Sigmund Freud Archives.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.212" offset="178892">Disagreements arose and he was terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.140" offset="190595">Masson's own story and the whole background of the dispute were of sufficient interest to Janet Malcolm, an author, that she wrote an article about Masson and about the Archives.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.978" offset="233958">She wrote the article after a series of interviews with Masson, many of which were tape recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.976" offset="253916">The article was published first as a series in the New Yorker Magazine, and then as a book.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.080" offset="270321">Her work received complimentary reviews, and this gave little joy to Masson, however, for the articles portrayed him in the most unflattering light.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.879" offset="309505">Masson sued Malcolm, the New Yorker Magazine, and the book publisher for defamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.639" offset="328626">Malcolm's narrative device consists of enclosing lengthily passages in quotation marks.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.173" offset="354749">According to Masson, a member of the key passages in the article that purport to quote him were fabrications, attributing to him words he never spoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.525" offset="388185">His position in the litigation has been that Malcolm's alteration of the quotations show the actual malice that is necessary for him to take his case to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.839" offset="421413">He conceives he is a public figure in the case so he must need the actual malice standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.053" offset="442207">Actual malice is a shorthand term, a term of art we use, perhaps it is an unfortunate phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.778" offset="465194">It does not indicate ill will or animosity.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.315" offset="487346">It means, in the context of a defamation suit, that a statement is made with knowledge of falsity or with reckless disregard for truth or falsity.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.565" offset="528306">Both the District Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Masson had not shown actual malice in this sense because the quotations were irrational interpretation of the things that Masson had said.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.039" offset="578148">We granted certiorari and we now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.870" offset="589537">This case comes to us after a summary judgment was granted, so we must assume that Malcolm acted with the required mental state and that the quotations were in fact altered.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.581" offset="624332">Masson must still prove these matters, and the questions whether he can prevail if he does so.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.606" offset="644499">In some sense, any alteration of a verbatim quotation is false, but writers and reporters by necessity alter what people say at the very least to eliminate grammatical or syntactical infelicities.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.191" offset="694758">If every alteration constituted the falsity required to prove actual malice, the practice of journalism would require a radical change, when inconsistent with our precedents and First Amendment principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.086" offset="738331">We reject the idea that any alteration beyond correction of grammar or syntax by a self-proof falsity in the sense relevant to determining actual malice, technical distinctions between correcting grammar and syntax and some greater level of alteration do not appear workable.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.158" offset="802696">We can think of no method by which courts or juries would draw the line between these and other changes except by reference to the meaning a  statement conveys to a reasonable reader.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.271" offset="839163">On the other hand, we also reject the Court of Appeals' views of our cases that any rational interpretation of an ambiguous statement is permitted when quotation marks are used.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.614" offset="880541">Quotation marks used in an orthodox manner indicate to the reader that the author is not interpreting the speaker's ambiguous statement but is attempting to convey what the speaker said.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.187" offset="922755">Were we to assess quotations under a rational interpretation standard, we would give journalists the freedom to place statements in their subject's mouths without fear of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.461" offset="959849">By eliminating any method of distinguishing between the statement of the subject and the interpretation of the author, we would diminish the trustworthiness of the printed word and eliminate any real meaning of quotations.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.985" offset="1005929">In order to prove falsity, we require that an altered statement convey a materially different meaning to the reader than the actual statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.848" offset="1037380">This is the sense in which falsity is understood in the common law of defamation and the First Amendment actual malice requirement relies upon this historical understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.853" offset="1077400">Quotation marks allow the reader to form his or her conclusions, and to assess the conclusions of the author instead of relying entirely upon the author's characterization of her subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.345" offset="1119405">Fabricating quotation may injure reputation in at least two senses, either one giving rise to a conceivable claim in defamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.387" offset="1151588">First, the quotation might injure because it attributes an untrue factual assertion to the speaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.996" offset="1186069">An example would be a fabricated quotation by a public official admitting that he had been convicted of a serious crime when in fact he had not been.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.258" offset="1223059">Second, regardless of the truth or falsity of the factual matters asserted within the quoted statement, the attribution may result an injury to reputation because the manner of expression or even the fact that the statement was made indicates a negative personal trait or an attitude the speaker does not hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.752" offset="1289096">John Lennon was once quoted as saying of the Beatles "We are more popular than Jesus Christ now."</text>
            <text syncTime="309.551" offset="1312293">Supposing the quotation had been a fabrication, it appears California law could permit recovery for defamation because even without regard to the truth of the underlying assertion, false attribution of the statement could have injured his reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.085" offset="1370389">The self-condemnatory quotation may carry more force than criticism by another.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.810" offset="1389302">It is against self-interest to admit one's own criminal liability, arrogance, or lack of integrity and so all the more easy to credit when it happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.117" offset="1422530">The principle underlies the elemental rule of evidence which is that admissions are allowed in evidence despite their hearsay character.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.049" offset="1454190">Applying these standards to the case before us, we conclude that many of the statements of which petitioner complains, do in fact convey a substantially different meaning than the tape recorded statements, and therefore, evidence to requisite falsity.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.245" offset="1502987">The Court of Appeals did not have occasion to address petitioner's arguments that the two publishers might be held liable either as Malcolm's employer or because they publish with knowledge or reckless disregard of falsity, we decline to address those arguments in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.189" offset="1558785">Justice White has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Justice Scalia joins.</text>
