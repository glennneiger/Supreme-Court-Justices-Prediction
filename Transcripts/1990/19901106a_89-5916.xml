            <text syncTime="1877.741" offset="7643530">Well, we think that, we think that you should not write off this practice as nothing more than one of the longest running violations of a statute's plain meaning in our legal history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.657" offset="7691177">Instead, we submit that a closer look at the statute and the historical record shows the opposite is the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.531" offset="7714687">As currently enacted, the Federal witness fee statute provides that fees and allowances... excuse me, allowances shall be paid to witnesses in attendance at Federal court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.169" offset="7753244">And the particular question here is whether petitioner, a convicted state prisoner, is entitled to receive the fees under the statute where he testified in a Federal criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.645" offset="7791174">In our view, petitioner is not entitled to receive the fees under the statute because he was not in attendance within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.229" offset="7825446">As the statute's structure and history suggests, in attendance means more than just being there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.525" offset="7854599">It also includes the process under which the witness appears in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.877" offset="7872049">A prisoner such as petitioner appears in court under a particular process directed to his custodian and that process is the writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum.</text>

            <text syncTime="2036.905" offset="8280186">1825 speaks in terms of... it's the procedure for paying the witness.</text>

            <text syncTime="2059.341" offset="8369943">It doesn't make sense to provide for payment of fees under 1821 that do not establish a procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2070.739" offset="8415500">Well, what I'm, what I'm suggesting is that the procedure that 1825 addresses may well be simply a procedure for distinguishing some witnesses who cannot be paid without the certification of a public defender or a clerk of court as opposed to witnesses who may be paid on certification of a United States Marshal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2091.751" offset="8499510">Well, that's true because in 1825(a) you'll notice that there's no provision for paying... when the Government subpoenas a witness the same requirements don't obtain.</text>

            <text syncTime="2130.496" offset="8654573">First of all, 1825... there are two separate questions and one is... the first question, the first point that we raise in our brief, admittedly belatedly, which is whether this particular witness... we do concede that Mr. Demarest was a witness... presented the right pieces of paper to be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.535" offset="8758645">The second question, and the broader question that's before this Court, is what is the meaning of 1821, and we submit that it makes sense to look at section 1825, the procedures, in order to understand what Congress was dealing with in section 1821.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.768" offset="8831578">And the use of the word subpoena and again this... there are no smoking guns in this case for our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.103" offset="8868986">We are trying to piece together what's out there and understand the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.088" offset="8888943">And the fact that there's been this 200-year practice, starting with the first witness fee statute, suggests to us that you can't write this case off out of plain meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="3408.166" offset="13765169">I have information to give to the court for both the defense and the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.887" offset="13780111">And we... Congress... there's no reason to assume that Congress wanted to encourage that when we have this unending practice of drawing the distinction between convicted prisoner witnesses and all others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.377" offset="13826086">And we concede that as you get away from these... this... these two ends of the spectrum there are difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.290" offset="13853672">But the one thing we do know and no one has been able to dispute is that convicted prisoners have fallen outside the scope of the statute since the beginning and the reason is, we submit, is the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.768" offset="13903618">And I don't want to leave the Court with the impression it's just a piece of paper calling it a subpoena or a writ, but the process of how the prisoner gets to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.792" offset="13935696">And because he gets to court differently from everyone else, and differently from the way Congress envisioned witness attendance in 1792 and throughout its history, he's not entitled to receive that fee under the statute as it's currently written.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.103" offset="13988986">If there are no other questions, thank you.</text>
