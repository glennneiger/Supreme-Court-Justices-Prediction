            <text syncTime="50.924" offset="339847">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="55.348" offset="357505">This case presents an important question of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.402" offset="369731">The provision in issue is a section of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C., section 11341(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="64.994" offset="396167">That section applies to a railroad participating in a consolidation that has been approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.780" offset="423229">It provides that such a railroad is exempt from all other law to the extent necessary to let the railroad carry out its consolidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.725" offset="454994">The question before this Court is whether this exemption protects the railroad from claims that are based on the railroad's contracts and are asserted exclusively under Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.533" offset="498253">The particular contracts involved here are labor agreements, and the particular law is the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.379" offset="525629">Since 1920 in a series of statutes, Congress has encouraged the nation's railroads to merge and consolidate under the supervision of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.074" offset="560425">To this end, Congress has given the ICC exclusive jurisdiction over matters with in its authority and given to railroads participating in approved consolidations a broad exemption from other legal restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.331" offset="605460">This exemption originated in the Transportation Act of 1920, was reenacted in 1933, reenacted in 1940, and took its present form in 1978 when it was recodified without substantive change.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.440" offset="657914">CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern are two of today's large railroad systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.123" offset="676617">Each system was formed when two previously separate railroad systems were placed under common control with ICC approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.368" offset="705665">On receipt of that approval, these railroads set out to achieve the traditional purposes of mergers and consolidations, which include the realization of greater economies and efficiencies through the combination of facilities, the elimination of redundant facilities, the bringing control of various operations into single locations, and otherwise taking advantage of economies of scale that the consolidations make possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.254" offset="801169">Now as part of carrying out their consolidations, CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern each sought to transfer work from one of their previously separate properties to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.870" offset="843592">CSX Transportation had a freight car heavy repair shop at Way Cross, Georgia and another, same kind of shop, at Raceland, Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.925" offset="879850">CSXT didn't need to retain both shops, and the facility at Raceland was larger and more modern and it had substantial excess capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.491" offset="914123">Therefore, CSXT proposed to bring to Raceland the freight heavy repair work that was previously done at Way Cross.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.787" offset="943275">Norfolk Southern proposed to make a slightly different kind of operational change.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.769" offset="963233">Norfolk Southern operates more than 2,000 locomotives.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.961" offset="975980">Previously the distribution of locomotives... their assignment to specific trains and facilities... was handled separately on each of Norfolk Southern's two constituent railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.418" offset="1013806">Now, Norfolk Southern proposed to bring all of this work to one location where one of the railroads would administer the work for the whole Norfolk Southern system.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.843" offset="1051527">The unions in each case resisted the railroad's proposed changes contending that these changes were inconsistent with provisions of their existing labor agreements and also that the Railway Labor Act gave the unions the right to insist that the changes not be made until either the unions had agreed to them or the railroads had exhausted the Railway Labor Act's virtually endless process for the negotiation of changes to existing agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.762" offset="1163226">The ICC held that the railroad's proposed changes were exempt by virtue of section 11341(a) from claims asserted under the Railway Labor Act, including claims based on labor agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.261" offset="1217143">The Commission found that the railroad's actions were subject to the processes of the ICC's employee protective conditions, which had been imposed on both consolidations as required by a different section of the Interstate Commerce Act, section 11347.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.674" offset="1282867">The protective conditions confer on employee a generous array of compensatory benefits including a guarantee of wage protection for as long as 6 years if they are affected by the consolidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.732" offset="1339083">And the protective conditions also establish a procedure for the negotiation and, if necessary, arbitration of an agreement to govern the manner in which a railroad may implement its approved consolidation if the implementation will cause employees to be dismissed or displaced or will require a rearrangement of the work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.444" offset="1417972">And it was that procedure that was followed in these cases and which led to the ICC's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.638" offset="1442736">The court of appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.751" offset="1451200">It held that the exemption from all other law reaches only positive legislative enactments and is ineffective against claims asserted under contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.197" offset="1488921">The court reasoned that because labor agreements are a form of contract, the statutory exemption does not apply to them and to the claims asserted by the unions in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.684" offset="1526851">Now that decision of the court of appeals was surely incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.187" offset="1540852">Contractual obligations are binding only because of the law and an exemption from law bars enforcement of those obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.860" offset="1571572">This Court held in 1948 in Schwabacher that the statutory exemption covers claims based on contracts.</text>

            <text syncTime="846.665" offset="3522815">In the CSX case, the employees on the Seaboard property, the property in which that Way Cross shop was located, had what is called the Orange Book collective bargaining agreement which had been negotiated in connection with an earlier merger that resulted in that Seaboard Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.307" offset="3589375">They contended that the Orange Book contractually barred the merged railroad from moving work... their work... from Raceland... from Way Cross, Georgia, where it was covered by the Orange Book to the property at Raceland, Kentucky, which was not in that original Orange Book merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.721" offset="3663040">So they said that the Orange Book was a bar itself, a contractual bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.674" offset="3678818">By way of example in the Norfolk Southern case involving the transfer of employees who perform work known as distribution of locomotive power, the employees were to be moved... or the work was to be moved and employees given an opportunity to follow it from a property where one union had a contract that covered that work to the other property where the work was done by management officers of the other company.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.401" offset="3777770">And the employees in that case contended that their agreement barred the transfer, although the specifics were always unclear to us, and also that before the transfer could be accomplished, the railroad had to negotiate with the union over the terms of the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.432" offset="3845897">That is that the Railway Labor Act conferred on their employees through their union the right to insist on negotiation before such a change could be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.787" offset="3875259">Below, the railroads thought they were at issue over the question of claims based on the Railway Labor Act, encompassing but broader than claims simply asserted on specific labor agreements.</text>

            <text syncTime="1110.211" offset="4577012">The... but the ICC said when it heard these cases on remand from the court of appeals and rendered a decision under the protective conditions that its decision was... in deciding it was bound to apply the reading that the court of appeals gave to 11341(a)'s exemption provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.714" offset="4643050">And in a later decision last summer, the ICC has made clear that if this Court reverses the court of appeals on the exemption, the ICC will have to revisit its decision on the protective conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.782" offset="4683278">So the ICC sees 11347's scope as dependent, at least in part, on whether there is an exemption out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.734" offset="4711073">And we say that the... that that's clearly right, that the congressional action most recently in 1976 relating to employee protection, was done against the background of 56 years of this preexisting exemption and it bears that way, rather than the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="1218.128" offset="5008660">The issue in this case is whether section 11341(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act exempts a participant in a Commission-approved transaction from its contractual obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.064" offset="5048366">We submit that section 11341(a) does exactly that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.337" offset="5061532">We based our conclusion squarely on the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.160" offset="5076787">Section 11341(a) states that a carrier participating in an approved transaction is exempt from the antitrust laws and from all other law as necessary to carry out the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.627" offset="5122658">That exemption is easily sufficient to embrace those laws governing contractual obligations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1269.141" offset="5212728">The reason is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.934" offset="5219834">Contracts derive their force only from the fact that they're enforceable through law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.556" offset="5238328">What is actually being exempted here is the enforcement of those laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.870" offset="5255674">A naked promise without the background of law behind it would not be subject to this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.914" offset="5287752">But there would be no need for the exemption as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.427" offset="5297887">Now, this Court recognized as you note that principle in Schwabacher, that in fact contractual obligations are subject to the 11341(a) exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.184" offset="5336862">In that case the court held that the Commission's approval of a railroad merger could deprive dissenting shareholders of their contract rights under State law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1371.222" offset="5621074">As I said, section 11341(a) preempts the union's rights under the collective bargaining agreements to the extent that enforcement of those rights would prevent the railroad from carrying out the approved transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.720" offset="5662975">Indeed if it were otherwise many of these transactions could simply not take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.523" offset="5678230">Now, the unions do not quarrel with our basic position as section 11341(a) can preempt the enforcement of contractual rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.895" offset="5703726">Nor do they quarrel with the result in Schwabacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.368" offset="5713652">Instead the unions argued the contract in this case should be treated differently, because the Commission, in their view, has no authority or control over labor matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.324" offset="5749492">Now there are two fundamental problems with this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.958" offset="5759941">First, the union's argument is to whether the Commission has authority, control, or jurisdiction over labor matters are beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.293" offset="5785332">Section 11341(a) by its terms exempts a participant in a Commission-approved transaction from all law to the extent necessary to carry out the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.829" offset="5823471">The exemption does not depend on whether the Commission has jurisdiction over the subject matter of that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.752" offset="5843115">Second, the union's assertion is simply not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.044" offset="5856281">The I... the Interstate Commerce Act requires the Commission to consider and address labor matters when approving a proposed merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.918" offset="5883866">Indeed, as this Court recognized in Lowden v. The United States, mergers almost invariably affect collective bargaining agreements, and the Commission must consider those effects when evaluating the proposed transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.908" offset="5927752">Moreover, there is no need to read into section 11341(a) an implied exception for labor contracts, because the Interstate Commerce Act contains other provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1461.128" offset="5980624">First, as I've mentioned, the Commission must consider the interests of rail labor when deciding whether the proposed transaction is in the public interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2164.260" offset="8793176">The Interstate Commerce Act, the Railway Labor Act, and the Federal Railroad Safety Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.082" offset="8808431">And the... as this Court said in Schwabacher, the Interstate Commerce Act governs issuance of securities, car supply, joint use of terminals, abandonments, and so forth, and also governs all financial transactions governing combinations of railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.631" offset="8862661">Its only relationship to employees is to consider their interests in reaching public interest findings and to impose minimum standards to protect employees against the effects of its orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.807" offset="8899337">The second element, the Railway Labor Act, as this Court noted, was a complementary regime to the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2198.234" offset="8929117">And this act governs labor relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.064" offset="8936431">It governs the making and maintaining of agreements effecting rates of pay, rules, and working conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.589" offset="8958478">And section 7 first to the Railway Labor Act provides that if there is a controversy regarding those matters and a party refuses to submit that to arbitration, he shall not be construed... it shall not be construed as a violation of any legal obligation imposed upon such party by the terms of this act or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.481" offset="9034025">And that is precisely what the Commission says the employees must do now.</text>

            <text syncTime="2240.101" offset="9096509">The third part of these... of this tripartite statutory arrangement is the Safety Act, administered by the Federal Railroad Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.518" offset="9134230">Now, the petitioners and the Federal respondents stressed the exclusive and plenary nature of the Interstate Commerce Act, that it is the supreme law of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.594" offset="9170488">And so it is, but so is the Railway Labor Act and so is the Safety Act in their specific spheres of governance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.049" offset="9196297">And there's no doubt that any State law that intrudes upon that exclusive sphere of the Interstate Commerce Act is preempted by the supremacy clause as implemented by 11341.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.416" offset="9241855">And that was the situation in Schwabacher, where this Court held the State law chartering the railroad and was preempted to the extent it conflicted with the Interstate Commerce Act because Congress had occupied the field by giving complete control of the capital structure of railroads to the Interstate Commerce Commission, just as the Railway Labor Act is supreme, plenary, and exclusive in the governance of the making and maintaining of agreements affecting rates of pay, rules, and working conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.232" offset="9337045">Now the impact of these statutes do overlap, and when they do they must be accommodated, giving as full effect as possible to the meaning and purpose of each.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.348" offset="9369541">For example, the safety laws certainly impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.112" offset="9384588">They're expensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.622" offset="9386678">They impact upon the efficiency of railroads, the flexibility of railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.908" offset="9407785">The Railway Labor Act does the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.818" offset="9415412">But Congress says each of those things... each of those statutes are necessary in a public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.402" offset="9445714">There has never been before 1983 a court or of the Commission or an arbitrator ever to hold that any provision of the Railway Labor Act or a collective bargaining agreement to be in conflict with any provision of the Interstate Commerce Act or an ICC order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.636" offset="9530665">It's never happened, but in 1983, the Commission, in the R.G.W. case, held that conflict existed, and in 1985 it held that, by virtue of 11341, its orders and not the Railway Labor Act or labor contracts governed employee/management relations in connection with an approved transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.170" offset="9608823">And by an approved transaction the Commission meant that any action made operationally or economically feasible or desirable by the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.583" offset="9638498">In other words, any result of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.355" offset="9649574">The Commission made no attempt at accommodation of the two statutes at all or the separate complementary purposes, not did it even acknowledge that prior to 1983, no conflict had ever been held to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.913" offset="9695758">The Commission just invaded the Railway Labor Act's sphere of governance, declared the existence of a conflict, and proclaimed itself the winner.</text>

            <text syncTime="3339.201" offset="13492918">And if you have a consolidation you've got to move from A to B, naturally.</text>

            <text syncTime="3352.121" offset="13544640">There's no way to prove that isn't necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.813" offset="13551432">It is by definition necessary to go from A to B if you're going to consolidate A with B.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.836" offset="13571494">And that's the great problem that we face, and we think that what they have done is they've taken 11347, which is clearly... no question it was designed as a shield to protect employee rights against ICC orders, convert it into a sword, and cut out their contract rights.</text>
