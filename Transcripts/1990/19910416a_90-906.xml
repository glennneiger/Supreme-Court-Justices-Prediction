            <label>Mr. David L. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="12.251" offset="169918">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.895" offset="184547">This case involves a challenge to the constitutional validity of the Board of Review created as part of the administrative structure under which Washington Dulles and Washington National Airports have been leased by the Federal Government to an Airports Authority created by joint action of Virginia and the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.551" offset="283185">The problem in this case, and it is a novel one, arises from the fact that Congress made it a condition of the lease that the Airports Authority create a Board of Review, that this Board of Review have veto power over certain significant actions of the Airport Authority, and that the Board of Review shall consist of Members of Congress to be selected by the Airports Authority from lists to be furnished by the Speaker of the House and the President pro tem of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.864" offset="432397">The problem was addressed by the court of appeals after holding that the controversy was justiciable, and the court of appeals made essentially two determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.394" offset="490493">First, that the Board of Review was exercising Federal power and that its constitutionality had to be analyzed on that basis; and second, that when it was analyzed on that basis, its existence, its authority, and its composition violated the principle of separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.558" offset="575234">We contend that the court of appeals was wrong on both scores.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.242" offset="597908">First, and very significant to the analysis, we contend that it was wrong in concluding that for purposes of separation of powers analysis the Board of Review was exercising Federal power.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.831" offset="656318">The authority of the Board of Review derived from the joint action of Virginia and the District of Columbia in accordance with Federal conditions that were laid down in the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.278" offset="706055">Secondly, we believe that the conditions laid down in the act, although they do raise significant separation of powers questions in the unusual circumstances of this case, do not violate that basic separation of powers principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.522" offset="779094">If we may first address the rationale of the court of appeals, we note that it is at best only half-heartedly defended by the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.138" offset="821517">We think that choice was correct, that the court of appeals' rationale was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.551" offset="843146">The Board of Review is not created by Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.364" offset="866447">The Board of Review was created independently by the joint action of the State of Virginia and the District of Columbia in accordance with conditions laid down by Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.764" offset="920050">But Virginia and the District of Columbia were not coerced into creating that board any more than South Dakota was coerced into raising the drinking age to 21 as a condition of receiving Federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.417" offset="986610">Indeed we believe that the inducement, which admittedly did exist, was probably a good deal less than in that case and than in the case of Steward Machine Company against Davis.</text>

            <text syncTime="229.445" offset="1038751">Mr. Shapiro, by the same logic I suppose you would be... you're defending an effort by Congress to structure some kind of board of review with effective veto power, as this board has, over, for instance, the Federal funding of aid to the States for transportation or health services or welfare benefits, or anything else that the Federal Government provides money for.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.493" offset="1146898">I mean, that would be your theory, and it would be a means by which the Congress could in effect have a veto exercised by members of its appropriate committees.</text>

            <text syncTime="275.405" offset="1222548">It only poses the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.868" offset="1228400">That is we think that the fact that the board itself was not created by Congress leaves a difficult constitutional analysis--</text>

            <text syncTime="311.182" offset="1365699">That is it was not the kind of coercion that this Court has said literally destroys the independence of the State actor.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.316" offset="1402271">Now, as I said, we believe that that simply poses the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.031" offset="1421079">We have tried to explain in our brief that the constitutional issue that is posed by these conditions is a very difficult and serious one.</text>

            <text syncTime="347.539" offset="1511149">One is the one you just suggested, that is taken I think perhaps by the petitioner, to say if it's done by the States and if they weren't coerced, that's the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.324" offset="1554304">The respondents take the opposite conceptual approach and say if Congress has attached this condition, then Congress is asserting itself in a way in which it is not allowed to by the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1501.477" offset="6126881">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.143" offset="6149556">There is no dispute that Members of Congress could not exercise the powers that are assigned to the Board of Review if the Federal Government still ran the airports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.509" offset="6191038">There is also no dispute that Congress could have required the Airports Authority to submit its actions to Congress for a specified period of time, or ever for approval in the form of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.787" offset="6240148">The question here is whether Congress can make its delegation of authority over the airports subject to a condition that requires nine Members of Congress to exercise significant ongoing authority over those airports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.596" offset="6299394">Four factors of the Board of Review arrangement bear directly on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.770" offset="6320083">First, the Board of Review arose out of a Federal condition that is contained in a Federal statute and a lease of Federal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.846" offset="6356341">Second, that condition requires nine Members of Congress to comprise the Board of Review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.270" offset="6382046">They must all be recommended by the congressional leadership, and eight of them must serve on the congressional committees that have oversight responsibilities over the airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.816" offset="6420184">The third factor is the powers exercised by the Board of Review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.409" offset="6434604">There is no question that the types of powers that the board exercises are executive in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.885" offset="6456547">And the fourth factor is the nonseverability clause, or what we have called the drop-dead clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.258" offset="6477967">Congress has decided in the statute that if the Board of Review cannot exercise its powers, neither can the Airports Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.985" offset="6508896">And the significance of this factor is that Congress made that decision, not the District and not Virginia, and also that Congress believed that the power its Members would exercise was an essential element of the transfer.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="1610.686" offset="6563753">Ms. Goldman, what if instead of the transaction we have here Congress had simply said we're going to give a year-to-year lease to the Metropolitan Airports Authority, no Members of Congress on the review board at all, but the review board totally independent decides to abolish parking places for Members of Congress and Justices of the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.661" offset="6659570">And the chairman of the House Commerce Committee calls the members of the review board over about a month before the first year of the lease is due to expire and he says I really don't think Congress is going to renew this lease if you do that, and they accordingly change their mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.611" offset="6723414">Now, there would be nothing wrong under separation of powers with that, would there?</text>

            <text syncTime="1654.683" offset="6739714">There would be not... no official ongoing role that Members of Congress play.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.859" offset="6768449">Of course Congress still has the power, the retained congressional power to pass statutes and to decide whether the lease could go forward, but that's the kind of power Congress can exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.155" offset="6805543">Its mingling in the affairs may be improper, but it probably would not rise to the level of the separation of powers violation.</text>

            <label>Mr. William T. Coleman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2654.501" offset="10738957">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.422" offset="10746689">It is clear here that the power of appointment is in the State board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.036" offset="10769154">It's equally clear that the Congress has no power whatsoever to remove these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.070" offset="10793291">We make it clear in our brief that using the words "consist of" in other Federal statute doesn't mean that once the person is appointed he or she loses his job if he no longer holds the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.987" offset="10840939">You also have the fact that the Federal statutes, when they want to mean that, say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.441" offset="10858702">This one doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.771" offset="10864031">Also, here the, the State makes it clear that it has the power of removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.417" offset="10894646">And we say under your cases where if you're struggling with the power of interpretation, if you can interpret the statute in a constitutional way, you should do that rather than to interpret it in a way which I really don't think is supported by the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.387" offset="10946473">In addition, there was a lease created here, and that lease lay in Congress, and that lease talks in terms of appoint, not consist of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.153" offset="10985553">And Congress did nothing to change that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.396" offset="10994539">So that's an additional reason why you should try to interpret the statute the way I suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.650" offset="11011570">Finally, our forefathers wanted to create a Federal Government, but they didn't want the Federal Government to be at war with the State government, and therefore it went out of its way to say that people that occupy Federal office could also, if the State wanted, occupy State office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.114" offset="11101432">Here you have that type of federalism, and there is no reason to stretch the Federal separation of powers doctrine in this case, where the chief executive of the Federal Government says I'm not being intruded upon, there is no aggrandizement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.045" offset="11165170">What aggrandizement can there be when all Congress did was pass a statute which authorized the Federal officials to do what the Constitution said they could do, namely serve in State office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.514" offset="11215012">Now, certain States have rejected this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.676" offset="11227655">I think New Hampshire, for example, you have a position, provision, Justice Souter, which specifically says that the Federal official cannot occupy the State office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.494" offset="11262973">Virginia could have done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.054" offset="11269138">It didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.975" offset="11272899">In its case it has a statute which says that the Federal officer can occupy the State officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.898" offset="11292544">And I repeat, unless you find that the congressional person is an officer of the United States, which I think under the statute you can't find, or unless you find that what they're doing is exercising Federal power, then I think here you have to reverse the decision of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.891" offset="11372478">Thank you.</text>
