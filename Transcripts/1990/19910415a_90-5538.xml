            <text syncTime="11.660" offset="182593">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.501" offset="197953">This Court is called upon in this case to construe the following language in the Equal Access to Justice Act, a law which provides for attorneys' fees against the Federal Government, and that language is,</text>
            <text syncTime="26.998" offset="243929">"A party seeking an award of fees and other expenses shall within 30 days of final judgment in the action submit to the court an application for fees and other expenses which shows that that party is the prevailing party. "</text>
            <text syncTime="39.867" offset="295442">The question here is whether, as we maintain and as was universally the law prior to the decision below, that this limitations period may only be triggered by a court judgment, or whether, as the respondent, Secretary of Health and Human Services contends, this statute can be triggered by an administrative decision of an administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.592" offset="390319">This case began in 1982 when petitioner applied for Social Security disability benefits under the SSI program.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.268" offset="425010">He appealed adverse administrative decisions through the administrative process and the case proceeded to the Federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.254" offset="452909">After a period of time, the case was remanded before any proceedings on the merits or any decisions on the merits by the district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.799" offset="487181">The case was remanded for the taking of new evidence before the administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.161" offset="504631">This decision did not trigger the statute of limitations, because at that point there was no prevailing party in the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.388" offset="541516">The case was simply remanded for the taking of new evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.068" offset="552174">A few months later, in May of 1985, the appeals counsel of the Social Security Administration found this petitioner disabled, and later in that year, approximately 4 months later, benefits were actually paid to this petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.050" offset="608180">In May of 1985, approximately 5 months after... excuse me, 8 months after that, the petitioner filed an application for attorney fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.225" offset="656873">That was considered by the district court, and the district court denied attorney fees on the ground that the Government's position had been substantially justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.483" offset="689891">At no time did the district court or the Secretary indicate in any way that the petition, the application for fees, was untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.227" offset="724895">Petitioner appealed to the Ninth Circuit, and again the Secretary did not argue that the petition, the application was untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.032" offset="756033">In fact the case was fully briefed, and after that full briefing but before argument, the Ninth Circuit, sua sponte, raised the issue of the timeliness of the fee application, although the sua sponte order indicated that the first judgment of the district court remanding the case might have triggered the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.615" offset="834401">Later, however, when the Secretary did take a position in response to the sua sponte order, the issue became whether the administrative decision could trigger the limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.963" offset="879749">Later the Ninth Circuit did indeed hold that the administrative decision could trigger the limitations period and that the decision of the administrative agency would become final within 30 days of that decision, thus triggering that a fee application would have to be filed within 30 days of that administrative decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.216" offset="960833">The Secretary originally in his opposition agreed with that position, but on the merits, the brief on the merits in this Court has adjusted his position somewhat and says that the decision of the administrative agency becomes final 65 days after it is issued, and then the 30-day period is thus triggered after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.550" offset="1042127">In explaining why the Ninth Circuit's decision ought to be reversed we want to focus here on three things: the statutory language, the legislative history, and some practical considerations which we think merit reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.347" offset="1097297">Turning first to the statutory language, the term "judgment" is quite clearly a reference to the decision of a Federal court, and that is indeed the language used by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.925" offset="1143691">Decisions of administrative agencies simply are never called judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.799" offset="1159155">The Secretary... indeed the Secretary himself does not call any of his decisions judgments, but rather decisions, determinations, denials of review, and such like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.815" offset="1203250">In administrative law generally administrative agencies make awards, issue orders, make decisions, rulings, but they do not render judgments.</text>

            <text syncTime="460.152" offset="1976579">And that is what the phrase means.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.304" offset="1985147">It makes... it is not a reference whatsoever to the decision making of administrative tribunals.</text>

            <text syncTime="483.447" offset="2069679">Indeed the APA, the Administrative Procedure Act, sets definitions for scores of agency proceedings... before scores of agencies, and it uses various terminology such as order, disposition, and so on, but never the term judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.585" offset="2122238">But even conceding that an agency could call its decision a judgment, the question here is what Congress believed when it enacted the EAJA, and it surely drafted that terminology with the ordinary usage in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.615" offset="2174378">Indeed at four different points in the provisions that are before the Court today the term "judgment" is used, and each time it appears to be a reference to the decision of a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.889" offset="2215547">In fact twice there are cross references to other statutes which talk about collecting on that judgment, the clerk tax... the clerk of the court taxing court... costs, and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="845.166" offset="3516654">Most importantly as to the legislative history, the committee report actually addressed the very issue before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.882" offset="3551449">It proved the existing case law and stated that in this context, in the Social Security context, the administrative decision after remand is not a final judgment for statute of limitations purposes, and only a post-remand decision of some sort could provide that trigger.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.702" offset="3618740">And finally, the thrust of the 1985 amendments, both in the amendments and its legislative history, were generally... was to eliminate technical barriers to fees that might become traps for the unwary, and that that should not be the basis for denying a fee application.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.455" offset="3685718">As we stated in this case, it had been universally the law... our position had universally been the law, and the Secretary is still following that position by sending these forms to the claimants.</text>

            <text syncTime="923.189" offset="3828660">But for this purpose, to trigger the statute, all that is necessary is some type of post-remand final adjudication that discontinues this piece of litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1648.227" offset="6728879">And it is one reason under the practical considerations that we want the Court to consider why this doesn't necessarily apply to the EAJA, because as the Secretary concedes in his brief, these remand orders are often very short and boilerplate in nature, and you would have to look at the substance of what occurred to determine when it was timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.538" offset="6814143">Rather, under our view, you need a judgment of the district court, regardless of whether it's a fourth or sixth sentence case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1704.244" offset="6952905">The Equal Access to Justice Act imposes a time limitation on applications for attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.146" offset="6980491">The act requires that an application for attorneys' fees be filed within 30 days of final judgment in the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.881" offset="7007449">In our view the Secretary's post-remand decision is the final judgment in the action, when it is final and not appealable, and has therefore effectively terminated the action on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.850" offset="7055305">We believe that this interpretation is the correct reading of the Equal Access to Justice Act and the Social Security Act, and that it is strongly supported by this Court's decisions in Hudson and in Finkelstein.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.938" offset="7103684">We also believe that it provides a fair and practicable approach for all concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.249" offset="7120925">Petitioner's interpretation is that courts must enter orders solely to start the attorneys' fees clock running, and that if they do not do so there is simply no attorneys' fees time limitation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.116" offset="7168363">We believe the petitioner's interpretation is contrary to the governing statutes, and that it mandates a cumbersome procedure which is neither compelled nor warranted by the governing statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.806" offset="7215175">This Court's decisions in Hudson and in Finkelstein greatly clarify the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.350" offset="7245372">In Hudson the Court held that post-remand administrative proceedings are part of the civil action for which attorneys' fees can be recovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.797" offset="7283093">By an analogous principle, the event that conclusively resolves those proceedings should be considered the final judgment in the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.032" offset="7324053">Indeed in Hudson it was argued to the Court that civil actions should be interpreted solely with respect to events that happen in a courtroom, and the Court rejected that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.240" offset="7368879">By a similar principle the Court should also reject petitioner's argument that the final judgment in the action is only something that can occur in the court and cannot be--</text>

            <text syncTime="1917.053" offset="7804184">It may be easy enough with respect to the Social Security Administration, but I can think of a lot of other agencies that the thing is remanded and the thing sort of goes on forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.342" offset="7849323">I mean, a major proceeding, atomic licensing or an FCC proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.704" offset="7870744">I'm not sure that in major administrative cases of that sort it's as easy to identify the moment of judgment, as it is in Social Security.</text>

            <label>Mr. Clifford M. Sloan</label>
            <text syncTime="1955.408" offset="7957575">I would make two points in response to that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.261" offset="7964993">First of all, the question is whether, even in these mammoth proceedings that have dragged on, what is the point at which they have become final and no longer reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.517" offset="8006058">And there is a definite point to that, and it's one the courts have to resolve in any case in determining whether further review in the court would be timely, and the statutes are structured in such a way that a party knows his rights and knows when review is still available and when review has run out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.980" offset="8083903">And when review has run out, the proceedings have been terminated on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.623" offset="8098427">The second point, though, is that this brings up a fundamental point about the Equal Access to Justice Act and a fundamental problem in petitioner's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.127" offset="8128415">And that is that the Equal Access to Justice Act takes other statutes and statutory schemes as it finds them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.463" offset="8157777">It does not impose additional requirements of its own force on those statutory schemes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.496" offset="8177944">And to the extent that there are difficulties in complicated... other statutes and administrative proceedings, the difficulty is in those proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.109" offset="8208350">But that doesn't mean that the attorneys' fees statute itself has some kind of power or authority to impose additional requirements on the administration of those statutory schemes solely for the purpose of facilitating attorneys' fees applications, which is the burden of petitioner's position, that somehow the attorneys' fees statute, which in its structure is designed to allow for the recovery of attorneys' fees for actions in other proceedings, somehow has the power to engraft additional requirements onto the administration of those schemes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3075.817" offset="12439247">And then if the court does not clearly say so, the inference should be the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.611" offset="12462339">Now, petitioner has emphasized as a great practical problem with our approach the fact that it requires distinguishing between sentence 6 remands and other remands, but the key point about that is that we're not creating that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.001" offset="12523988">The Social Security Act creates that distinction, and this Court elaborated on that distinction in Finkelstein.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.805" offset="12547184">And again this relates to that fundamental principle of the attorneys' fees statute, that it takes the other statutory and regulatory schemes as it finds them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.940" offset="12579681">It does not impose upon them, it does... or change them in any way to the extent that the distinction between sixth sentence remands and other remands is difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.225" offset="12616879">It's a difficultly, number one, that is created by the statute itself, and number two, that we think could be plainly resolved by this kind of plain statement rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.801" offset="12651152">Now, there is an apparent anomaly even in a sixth sentence case about the fact that a fully favorable decision to the claimant still has to come back to the court for additional proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.032" offset="12708099">And we would suggest that that anomaly could be resolved by relatively simple practice that would allow sixth sentence remands and other remands to be treated essentially the same in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.790" offset="12755119">And what that would be is that at the time that a sixth sentence remand was going to be ordered by the court, the Government could simply in each case ask that there be a provision in the court's remand order that jurisdiction would terminate 65 days or whatever the period of review was after the administrative decision, unless any party brought it back to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.861" offset="12839338">And the result of that would be that you would have a final judgment at exactly the same time that you have in other remands, but it would be faithful to the statutory scheme that the district court is setting the terms of its jurisdiction under a sixth sentence remand.</text>
