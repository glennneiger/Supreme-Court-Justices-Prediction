            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="74152">The second case which I announce is Gregory against Ashcroft, No. 90-50.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.844" offset="105499">This case comes to us on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.024" offset="130159">The petitioners are Missouri State judges who challenge a provision in the Missouri State Constitution calling for the mandatory retirement of all state judges at age 70.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.400" offset="183657">Petitioners contend that this provision violates the Federal Age Discrimination and Employment Act and the Equal Protection Clause of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.271" offset="227230">We hold, in the opinion filed today, that the Missouri mandatory retirement provision is valid as against both challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.297" offset="267249">This case concerns a state constitutional provision through which the people of Missouri establish a qualification for those who sit as their judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.003" offset="310090">This is a decision of the most fundamental sort for a sovereign state.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.998" offset="330048">Through the structure of its government and the character of those who exercise government authority, a state defines itself as a sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.352" offset="367559">For congress to interfere with this decision would upset the constitutional balance of federal and state powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.243" offset="399115">We will not likely assume that Congress has intended to upset this balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.822" offset="421372">Consequently, in such a case, we will not read a federal statute as usurping state authority, unless Congress has stated plainly in the language of the statute that it intends such intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.038" offset="474243">The Age Discrimination and Employment Act does, plainly cover state employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.690" offset="496813">It just as plainly excludes from its coverage certain important state government officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.088" offset="522413">In particular, the Act excludes elected officials and their appointees on the policy making level.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.601" offset="552506">Petitioners in this case were appointed to office by the governor of Missouri an elected official.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.236" offset="579047">The governor contends that the petitioners are appointees on the policy making level and, therefore, exempt from the Federal Act's coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.513" offset="616141">One can fairly debate whether judges make policy in the sense intended by Congress in the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, but in the context of a statute that plainly excludes most important state officials, a term appointee on the policy making level is sufficiently broad that we cannot conclude that the statute plainly covers appointed state judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.144" offset="722720">Therefore, by applying the plain statement rule, we conclude that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.680" offset="744872">We also conclude that the Missouri mandatory retirement provision is valid under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.822" offset="785414">Age is not a suspect classification under that clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.199" offset="802864">Petitioners assert no fundamental interest in serving its judges, and the state need only demonstrate a rational basis for the retirement provision in order for it to withstand constitutional scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.576" offset="856363">And we conclude for reasons set forth in our opinion that there is such a rational basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.127" offset="878619">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.191" offset="894815">Justice White has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, and concurring in the judgment in which Justice Stevens has joined; Justice Blackmun has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Marshall has joined.</text>
