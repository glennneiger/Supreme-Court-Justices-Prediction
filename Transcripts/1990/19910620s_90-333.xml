            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="11.292" offset="119097">This case comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and it concerns the period of limitations applicable to a federal suit or alleged misrepresentations in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.252" offset="210943">The District Court granted summary judgment for the defendants on the ground that the complaints were not timely filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.507" offset="239887">And it ruled that Oregon's 2-year limitations periods for fraud claims governed.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.111" offset="266323">The Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.456" offset="275727">It accepted Oregon's limitations period but it found that there were unresolved factual issues as to when the plaintiffs should have discovered the alleged fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.225" offset="322852">We reverse that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.495" offset="327867">We hold that litigation of this kind must be begun within one year after the discovery of the facts and within three years after such violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.283" offset="374992">We conclude that neither the 5-year period contained in the '34 Act's insider trading provision, added in 1988, nor state law fraud provides a closer and better analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.840" offset="429222">The limitations period is not subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.697" offset="448657">There is no dispute that the earliest of the plaintiffs' complaints was filed more than three years after the alleged misrepresentations.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.075" offset="482199">And thus, the claims were untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.889" offset="493484">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment; Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion and is joined by Justice Souter; Justice O'Connor has filed a dissenting opinion and is joined by Justice Kennedy; Justice Kennedy also has filed a dissenting opinion and is joined by Justice O'Connor.</text>
