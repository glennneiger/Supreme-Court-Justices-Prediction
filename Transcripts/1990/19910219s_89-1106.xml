            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="6.127" offset="98436">The first case is No. 89-1106 Trinova Corporation versus Michigan Department of the Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.967" offset="121841">The case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.382" offset="135425">Michigan levies its single business tax upon entities which have business activity within that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.619" offset="160398">The single business tax is known as a value-added tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.873" offset="177430">Tax payers such as petitioner, Trinova a major company, they have operations both within and without Michigan must determine the portion of their tax base attributable to Michigan under a three-factor formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.280" offset="227063">This formula considers property payroll and sales in Michigan and allocate some Michigan tax, by computing these to the tax payer's property, payroll, and sales nationwide.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.965" offset="265828">In 1980, Trinova had little property and payroll within Michigan but made sales of over $100 million in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.847" offset="293309">The three-factor apportionment formula attributed 9% of Trinova's total business activity to Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.171" offset="322566">Trinova paid its tax to Michigan, and later brought this refund claim in a challenge to the apportionment formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.790" offset="349107">Relying upon the due process and commerce clauses, Trinova first contends that apportionment is unwarranted because the tax base is largely composed of the elements of compensation and appreciation, and that these items can be geographically located.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.896" offset="409502">We reject that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.917" offset="417652">The premise that the Michigan tax can be analyzed, as if it were separate taxes upon compensation, depreciation and income is not found.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.912" offset="453596">The taxes upon a different bona fide measure of business activity, the value added.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.130" offset="474494">The tax base includes the element of income which cannot be geographically located, but the result that the tax base as whole cannot geographically located.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.370" offset="511379">Trinova's approach would distort the theory of the tax and will not adequately account for the contribution of Michigan's sales to value added.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.237" offset="546906">Second, Trinova contends that even a sum of portion that were acceptable, the three-factor formula employed here lacks the required rational relation to Trinova's business activity in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.634" offset="600509">We have rejected similar challenges to the three-factor formula in the income tax context.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.299" offset="619108">Our reason implies also where the formula is used to apportion value added.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.840" offset="637289">Further, Trinova has failed to provide an alternative apportionment which would give any effect to its Michigan sales or acknowledge that value added is more than merely compensation plus depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.804" offset="681175">Finally, Trinova cannot demonstrate any facial discrimination or other violation of our tests for unconstitutional discrimination against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.032" offset="714089">The judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Michigan is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.453" offset="727778">Justice Scalia has filed in an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.549" offset="740107">Justice Steven has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Blackmun joins.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.090" offset="758289">Justice Souter took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
