            <text syncTime="408.973" offset="1756207">It was concerned that without private enforcement of the civil rights laws, that the civil rights laws might become a dead letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.297" offset="1781494">It was actively seeking to encourage civil rights litigation by awarding these fees, not to discourage it.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.562" offset="1814513">And again and again this Court has said and the legislative history has said that this was the central purpose, to encourage these suits to be brought to vindicate the civil rights not only of the plaintiffs in the cases, but of other people whom the plaintiffs represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.042" offset="1880446">At the same time there was a lesser purpose to some extent deter the defendants in these cases from raising defenses to meritorious claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="739.659" offset="3078944">It is said, for example, by the brief of the State of Hawaii and others as amicus that if attorneys' fees are allowed here it will devastate the State treasuries, and that for that reason the Court should not construe 1988 as allowing attorneys' fees in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.072" offset="3152504">The difficulty with that argument, of course, is it will devastate the State treasuries only, only if the petitioner as the plaintiffs in these cases prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.527" offset="3194405">And if they prevail they are serving the very purpose of the Civil Rights Act that led Congress to award of an attorney's fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.364" offset="3225752">They also argue that the reason that Congress wanted to get attorneys involved in these civil rights cases was to perform a sifting function, that they would sit there and decide which cases were meritorious and ought to be brought, and which cases were not meritorious and should not be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.716" offset="3303179">And they somehow suggest that a pro se attorney isn't going to perform the same sifting function.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.880" offset="3327734">The difficulty here again is that there simply isn't a single statement in the legislative history suggesting that Congress enacted 1988 or brought attorneys into the process in order to perform this sifting function.</text>

            <text syncTime="854.204" offset="3537131">The problem, Justice Kennedy, that the Congress faced in 1976 after this Court's decision in Alyeska was that they thought these cases would not be brought because they could not be brought based on the traditional attorney-client relationship in which the client retained the attorney and agreed to pay the attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.200" offset="3625112">Congress felt, in fact, so strongly about this that they concluded that if they did not provide for an award of attorneys' fees, that the civil rights laws would not be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.544" offset="3666490">And it is clear, I think, that pro se attorneys, individuals proceeding pro se as attorneys, have made valuable contributions in this area.</text>

            <text syncTime="922.799" offset="3811417">But there is the word "attorney" in the statute, there is the reference in the legislative history to the desire to bring expert individuals into this, and for that reason we think that the language and the history of the statute suggests that it falls short of awarding it to non-attorney pro se's, a result which has been reached by many of the circuits which have nonetheless agreed that pro se attorneys should recover.</text>

            <text syncTime="954.602" offset="3938686">As Justice O'Connor points out, the person who gets the award is simply described in the statute as the prevailing party, which would include anybody, attorneys or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1008.615" offset="4154771">But I also approach the statute not only looking at the word attorney, but looking at the legislative history which suggests this desire to have attorneys involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.464" offset="4202104">There was an apparent conclusion that attorneys were invaluable contributions to these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.656" offset="4222898">Now, a number of members of the Court have suggested that non-attorneys may bring valuable contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.300" offset="4249438">I don't dispute that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.571" offset="4254558">I say again that I agree that non-attorneys may make very valuable contributions to these cases, and that there are many reasons for arguing that they should also be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.320" offset="4305549">And I agree that if you look at the words "prevailing party" instead of attorney's fee, that maybe it is possible to reach the conclusion under this statute that it covers non-attorneys.</text>

            <text syncTime="1098.654" offset="4514842">The question presented in this case is whether a pro se litigant who is an attorney is eligible for attorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C. Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.392" offset="4553817">The language of 42 U.S.C. Section 1988 indicates that pro se litigants, whether attorneys or not, are not eligible for attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.707" offset="4595091">The language of that statute provides that the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1137.770" offset="4671368">In examining the definition of attorney's fee, we believe that it becomes clear that pro se litigants, whether or not attorneys, are not eligible for fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.657" offset="4714940">The phrase "attorney's fee" is defined as meaning charged to client for services rendered, and examples given, hourly fee, flat fee, contingency fee.</text>

            <text syncTime="2231.775" offset="9047401">The word "attorney" ordinarily denotes a person who is both licensed to practice law and who acts as the representative or agent of a client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.833" offset="9091600">Members of the bar generally do represent clients, but that does not mean that a lawyer who litigates a case pro se is functioning as an attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="2335.093" offset="9460658">And I should add in general that Mr. Dyk rests a great deal of his argument on the proposition that this distinction between organizations and pro se litigants would be very difficult to apply in practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.916" offset="9515933">And first of all we think this statute requires the distinction, so the difficulty of it is not really an issue, but we also think in the ordinary run of cases it's not going to be difficult to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.843" offset="9567655">It is the kind of determination courts make routinely, for example under this statute 1654, also in determining whether there is an attorney-client relationship or who the attorney represents in a corporate setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.353" offset="9629722">It is the kind of question that courts can answer quite easily in the borderline or difficult cases that may arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.708" offset="9663055">But in addition to a requirement of an attorney, there is a requirement of an attorney's fee as part of the costs, and a pro se litigant cannot pay himself a fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.951" offset="9720106">A pro se lawyer also incurs no costs for legal services other than opportunity costs, and this Court has never held that opportunity costs are compensable as attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.026" offset="9768380">Now, it is correct, as petitioner observes, that organizations represented by in-house counsel, as well as clients represented by attorneys on a pro bono basis, are eligible for fee awards under Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.733" offset="9819162">But this does not foreclose reliance on the statutory language authorizing an award of fees as a part of costs for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.689" offset="9855002">First, organizations actually incur costs for representation by in-house attorneys, although the costs may be in the form of a flat fee, that is a salary, and lawyers who represent clients pro bono have a fee arrangement with the client, even if it is to waive the fee, and more typically the arrangement is in the nature of a contingent fee, that is to recover any fee award under Section 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.276" offset="9965344">Second, the cases awarding attorneys' fees to in-house counsel rest on... I'm sorry, the second reason is that the awards of fees to organizations rest on the legislative history rather than the language of the statute, and we think the legislative history simply doesn't apply to pro se lawyers, because, as we have already argued, pro se lawyers are easily distinguished from organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.593" offset="10078611">We think the language of Section 1988 answers the question presented in this case, but the legislative history reinforces our interpretation of the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.151" offset="10124899">Statements in the legislative history such as</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.019" offset="10136289">"many citizens have little or no money with which to hire a lawyer. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.820" offset="10151544">indicate that Congress had in mind encouraging plaintiffs to obtain legal representation rather than litigating cases on their own, and we think that applies to lawyer litigants as well as to all other litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.914" offset="10211939">And finally, awarding attorneys' fees to pro se lawyers would not further the purpose of Section 1988, which is to make sure that competent counsel are available to civil rights plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.638" offset="10258855">At a minimum, it's certainly not necessary to adopt the result petitioner argues for to achieve the purpose of Section 1988, because under the court of appeals decision lawyers have precisely the same ability to vindicate their civil rights as all other litigants, and in fact they may have a greater ability because if they choose to litigate pro se they can apply whatever additional skills they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.789" offset="10363450">And we also think, frankly, that encouraging pro se litigation by lawyers would not ensure that competent counsel would be available in civil rights cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.245" offset="10401275">Pro se lawyers often lack the detachment and objectivity that is necessary for effective professional representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.484" offset="10434189">A pro se lawyer may be inclined to focus on the recovery of a fee to the exclusion of vindication of the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2889.032" offset="11676364">I do not know the answer, but I think a relatively small number of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.586" offset="11694650">And by seeking out these statutes, by successfully having them declared unconstitutional, by litigating these issues he is doing exactly what Congress wanted done, and that is that the civil rights of people in this country are vindicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.346" offset="11757657">Not just Mr. Kay's rights, but those of the people in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.250" offset="11773226">Congress wasn't just concerned about the individual litigants, it was concerned about the breadth of enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.986" offset="11800184">And there is no basis, we suggest, for distinguishing between a situation in which the individual is proceeding pro se and all these other situations where it is conceded that the organization or the class or the partnership is proceeding pro se and would recover fees.</text>
