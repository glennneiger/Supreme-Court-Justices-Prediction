            <text syncTime="20.175" offset="198503">This case presents two closely related questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.007" offset="217834">First, should Federal securities fraud claims under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 be governed by a single Federal statute of limitations or by the law of the forum State on a case-by-case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.018" offset="285857">Second, should the Federal rule be the 1-year/3-year standard established by Congress for the comparable Federal securities fraud remedies at the same time that it created Section 10(b), or by a limitations period enacted... extracted from some other Federal law passed decades later.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.583" offset="364119">The respondents are Oregon residents who brought actions under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 to recover the losses they had sustained on limited partnership tax shelter investments.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.839" offset="409155">Petitioner is a New Jersey law firm that was involved in preparing some of the offering materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.132" offset="430261">Oregon's 2-year fraud statute of limitations was applied by both courts below in adjudicating petitioner's summary judgment motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.567" offset="464012">The district court granted the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.290" offset="474983">The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that issues of fact remained as to when the alleged fraud was discovered.</text>

            <text syncTime="108.342" offset="551156">I will focus today on three principal contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.313" offset="567039">First, the wasteful and debilitating consequences of borrowing State limitations periods on Federal policies, the Federal civil justice system, and Federal litigants make it essential that a uniform Federal standard be adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.465" offset="631613">Second, the 1-year/3-year limitation period, repeatedly adopted by Congress when it enacted the 1933 and the 1934 securities acts, including Section 10(b), is the only choice for Section 10(b) that is compelled both as a matter of legislative intent and as the standard most compatible with the Federal remedy and the Federal policies underlying that remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.231" offset="734745">This solution has been endorsed with near unanimity by the courts, commentators, and the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.186" offset="762539">Third, neither the 5-year limitations period adopted by Congress in 1988 for insider trading, nor the 4-year limitations period adopted in 1979 for land sales are rational, workable, or jurisprudentially acceptable alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.690" offset="836518">Turning first to the operation and effect of the system that prevails in many of the circuits today, that system, with the exception of the three circuits, the Second, Seventh, and Third Circuit, is to apply the law of the forum State.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.228" offset="898689">The district court applies the fraud statute of limitations, the Blue Sky statute of limitations, the contract statute of limitations, the personal injury statute of limitations, or some catch-all statute of limitations, depending upon the particular facts of the particular case and the particular forum in which the case is brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.501" offset="971832">Thus there are 50, 100, 150, and more potential statutes of limitations to apply at the outset in a 10b-5 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.078" offset="1010075">State statutes of limitations for fraud or Blue Sky may vary from as short as 1 to as many as 10 years, and these complications are exacerbated because then the district courts apply different and numerous rules of tolling with respect to when the statute of limitations has begun to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.691" offset="1092518">Furthermore, as respondents point out and concede in their brief, State statutes of limitations with respect to fraud or Blue Sky are constantly changing.</text>

            <text syncTime="953.949" offset="3933595">And this Court has not considered the statute of limitations before.</text>

            <text syncTime="971.379" offset="4003290">It is also true that if the Court adopts a separate or a distinct methodology, which I think, and I respectfully submit, is really the same as looking at legislative intent anyway, but if the Court looks at it differently and applies the analogy standard that is articulated in the Agency Holding v. Malley-Duff case, one draws... comes to the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.355" offset="4095241">In Blue Chip this Court examined, in order to determine the scope and contours of Section 10(b) with respect to the purchaser and seller requirement, it... this Court looked to the express causes of action in the '33 and '34 act, called them comparable causes of action, said that they were the appropriate vehicle and analogy to compare them with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.411" offset="4187401">This Court has repeatedly said that standards of fraud under the common law are light years away from the right created under Section 10(b), and that those comparable causes of action do provide an appropriate analogy because they are Federal, they are intended to be uniform, they are intended to provide private redress for securities fraud, they all arise at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.714" offset="4276635">And the other aspect of this from the standpoint of the analogy standard is that if this Court were to adopt a longer period of limitations for Section 10(b), 5 years, for example, as the Commission suggests, that would tend to write out, nullify, or repeal the legislation that the 30... the 73d Congress specifically focussed on and enacted with respect to these other statutes, because, as this Court has noted, the actions under Section 9 of '34 act, Sections 11 and 12 of the '33 act, and so forth, can be brought under Section 10(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.650" offset="4424384">So an artful pleader, if given a choice between a 5-year statute of limitations as the Commission urges, and the 1 and 3-year statute of limitations that Congress expressly adopted, would naturally plead it under Section 10(b) to take advantage of the 5-year statute of limitations, thus resulting in a judicial nullification of the express intent of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="1400.250" offset="5718804">Several members of the Congress indicated that they had not in their lifetime been exposed to more debate, public commentary, public controversy, with respect to what the statute of limitations would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.247" offset="5766764">When the 1933 act was passed and express remedies were created, the Congress enacted a 2-year/10-year statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.262" offset="5798843">There was, there was a great amount of public outcry and lobbying, both from the business community and people on the other side of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.869" offset="5829249">Congress then had considerable hearings and debates, and specifically conducted that balancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.914" offset="5853491">They understood that they might be cutting off the rights of some plaintiffs when they enacted a statute of limitations that was the length that they enacted in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.548" offset="5891943">But they did so quite intentionally and they considered the impact of the potential, which is described well by this Court in Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion for the Court in the Blue Chip case, the effect of Section 10b-5 actions might have on officers, directors, accountants, underwriters, issuers, and so forth, and the international marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.333" offset="5979088">The Court conducted that balancing process and decided that that 3-year statute of limitations was the right solution for securities act limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.668" offset="6020466">The one thing that I would like to mention before I reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal is that the respondents have urged that the international... the Interstate Land Sales Act, which was amended in 1979 to have a 4-year statute of limitations, ought to be the guide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.570" offset="6092041">I would simply like to reiterate what we have said in our brief, that the Interstate Land transactions act, Congress was not balancing the importance of secondary markets and the effect upon the economy of litigation with respect to securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.841" offset="6153168">This is a statute which Congress enacted without consideration of what the appropriate statute of limitations ought to be in securities cases, and it is a nontollable... it is a tollable, arguably, statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.759" offset="6208861">The respondents favor that statute of limitations because they contend that there should be a tollable statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.512" offset="6231848">I say that that is the strongest evidence that it's not the right statute of limitations, because the one thing about which there was virtually, if any... there was no dissent in 1934, none in the Senate anyway, that the absolute 3-year statute should be a bar and that there should not be in this field a tollable statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.985" offset="6305723">With the Court's permission, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1691.769" offset="6884910">No, Your Honor, most courts hold that recklessness is also sufficient, but they do not hold that negligence is sufficient or that there are strict liability causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.517" offset="6923884">And the instruction which is given for recklessness, as I can testify as plaintiff's lawyer, is exceedingly onerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.312" offset="6951052">It comes so close to fraud that it is all but fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.532" offset="6963904">Furthermore, we should not be looking at the intent of the 73d Congress in any specific way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.830" offset="6997132">This Court has held on many occasions, Bankers Life, Blue Chip Stamps, Herman &amp; MacLean, Basic Inc., Aaron v. SEC, this Court has always looked at Section 10(b) as a catch-all antifraud remedy, Congress' invitation to the SEC and maybe the courts in the future to fashion flexible antifraud remedies that would match the evolution of securities fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.719" offset="7116668">Those antifraud remedies have been developed in the sixties and the seventies and the eighties, in this Court in the seventies and the eighties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.273" offset="7154911">They are broad remedies, and to now shoehorn them back into the intent of Congress with the result of imposing a statute of repose, a 3-year statute of repose, would be a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.942" offset="7205589">It is too easy for promoters to figure out how to conceal their frauds for 3 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.256" offset="7226800">This Court has, is certainly aware of Ponzi schemes whereby promoters are able to feed back proceeds from later investors to earlier investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.152" offset="7270373">There are all kinds of accounting schemes whereby corporate executives and accountants can monkey with the books and go under... undiscovered for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.711" offset="7312586">The bond investors who have filed an amicus brief here present a particularly compelling situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.585" offset="7344142">They tell us that securities fraud... they tell us that the average municipal bond which is unregistered and has no remedy except 10b-5, the average municipal bond will not default for 4 and a half years, then investors will have no idea that they have been defrauded until there has been a default.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.648" offset="7420420">And the result of a 3-year statute of repose is going to mean that the only Federal, the only Federal remedy for securities fraud available to bondholders will not apply in more than half of the cases where there is fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.408" offset="7479457">Now, the respondents would like to make three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.991" offset="7493772">First, under your tests in DelCostello and Malley-Duff, it is still the norm, it is still the rule for this Court to borrow State statutes of limitations, and there is nothing about the borrowing of State statutes of limitations which has frustrated or interfered with Federal policy, and State... and the State statutes from which these statutes of limitations are taken, common law fraud and Blue Sky statutes of... Blue Sky statutes, are at least as analogous to 10(b) and Section 10b-5 as are the Federal alternatives that are being proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.467" offset="7663672">No interference, just as analogous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.061" offset="7674017">The second point we are... we want to make is that this Court should reaffirm its holdings in Bailey v. Glover and Holmberg v. Armbrecht that a statute of limitations for fraud is... it is particularly important that a statute of limitations for fraud be discovery based, that it be tollable, that is that it not start to run until the plaintiff either discovers or should have discovered that he or she has a cause of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1923.092" offset="7810167">The third point we want to make is that recent congressional action and inaction in the face of the evolution of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, particularly where Congress has turned its attention to the securities laws on a number of occasions to examine them for problems, that recent inaction and ratification by Congress is of much more significance than the intent of the 73d Congress, an intent which this Court has repeatedly said is only of the most general nature, and an intent which invited the future to fashion remedies that would deal with the evolving nature of securities fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.783" offset="7992919">That is what you've said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.932" offset="7997517">Now the respondents make a big point of the lack of uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.936" offset="8029491">This lack of uniformity as a problem has been only recently perceived by three circuit courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.263" offset="8066794">Prior to that, it is hard to find examples of problems arising because of the use of statutes... borrowed State statutes, and there is a reason for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.092" offset="8110157">The reason is because the Federal courts have imposed the rule of Holmberg v. Armbrecht whenever they have borrowed State statutes of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.419" offset="8155506">That is they have borrowed the duration from State law, but they have insisted that whatever that duration they borrowed was, that it not start until discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.613" offset="8196257">So the result is that whatever the duration has been, it has been of minor significance because plaintiffs have been allowed... because it has not start to run until plaintiffs discover their cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.772" offset="8244844">So the result has been that plaintiffs bring their causes of action very quickly--</text>

            <text syncTime="2169.664" offset="8796446">What you had in the relationship between the Clayton Act and Rico was that you had a subsequent statute, Rico, which you found had been very much patterned after the language and the concept of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.104" offset="8862170">And so you said that this is the best indication of what Federal policy should be in a statute of limitations for Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.292" offset="8902921">Now look at the Interstate Land Sales Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.402" offset="8911385">In the late sixties, in 1968 or '69, Congress passed a remedy for people who are cheated by the sales through the mails and over the telephone of land in sunny climates and the like, investment properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.081" offset="8974079">And what Congress did was to enact a remedy which sort of sat between a 12-2 remedy in the securities laws and a 10b-5 remedy in the securities law, but Congress did say that it was intending to pattern this after the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.471" offset="9035623">What it did 10 years later, though, is what is compelling about this analogy, because 10 years later it decided to make the Interstate Land Sales Act more like the securities act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.969" offset="9081703">It decided to divide out a 12-2 remedy, a strict liability-type remedy... 12-2 of the 1933 act is what I am referring to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.384" offset="9115349">They decided to divide out a 12-2 remedy, and they decided to divide out a 10b-5 remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.499" offset="9135829">And they made that 10b-5 remedy identical, or practically identical, to Rule 10b-5 in the securities acts, and once again they said our intention here is to pattern this after the securities acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.626" offset="9184312">Then what did they do with respect to the statute of limitations?</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.159" offset="9198418">They took a 3-year statute of repose and put it on the 12-2 remedy, the 73d Congress, and then they took a 3-year from discovery, a discovery-based statute of limitations, and put it on the 10b-5 remedy for 10b-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.590" offset="9264142">Look at what else Congress has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.171" offset="9274487">Congress, when they enacted the residual statute of limitations in the Judicial Reform Act, Section 313, enacted a 4-year statute of limitations based upon accrual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.700" offset="9316596">Under the holdings of the Federal courts that notion of accrual will probably also turn out to be discovery based.</text>

            <text syncTime="2609.501" offset="10555741">Congress knew that it was cutting off rights, and it intended to cut off rights, because it balanced the enforcement objectives and the remedial objectives of the '33 and '34 act with the effect of those remedies on the marketplace, and it cut off those rights and it intended it not to be a discovery based limitation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2635.227" offset="10658663">Well, the problem with what my opponent says with respect to those are not being fraud actions, is that Congress repeatedly characterized those actions as fraud actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.056" offset="10702026">The legislative history of the 1933 and '34 act contain the word "fraud" literally thousands of times in reference to the express remedies created by those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.812" offset="10745076">They are... some of them have less of a standard of proof for the plaintiff, some of them have a greater standard of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.375" offset="10767333">Section 9 of the '34 act does require sienter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.158" offset="10782379">The one thing in common with respect to the statutes that Congress created, the remedies that Congress created that the Congress called fraud statutes... some of which had sienter, some of which did not... is that they all had an express statute of limitations, they all had the same statute of limitations, and it cut off the rights at 3 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.770" offset="10852910">The Holmberg case v. Armbrecht dicta is just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.483" offset="10871718">It's dicta by Justice Frankfurter in an equity case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.584" offset="10884152">As this Court said in American Pipe and Construction v. Utah in 1974, the concept of Federal tolling must be construed to be consistent and consonant with the legislative scheme and the legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.203" offset="10942562">In this case the legislative scheme and the legislative purpose are clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.027" offset="10957922">If there is, as this Court said in Touche Ross v. Redington, if there is any injustice as a result of someone's right being cut off, that... if this result, as the Court said, then sanctions injustice, that argument, when made here, is made in the wrong forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.350" offset="11031169">This Court is not at liberty to legislate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.001" offset="11041827">The 73d Congress conducted the legislative activities necessary to apply a statute of limitations to the '33 and '34 acts and the Section 10(b) remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.928" offset="11081533">As this Court said in DelCostello, the family resemblance between Section 10(b) and the other '33 and '34 act express remedies is undeniable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.584" offset="11124165">There's an, a substantial overlap of remedies and the balancing of interests is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.737" offset="11144750">Congress has conducted that balance of interest, of remedies, and selected a 3-year statute of limitations.</text>
