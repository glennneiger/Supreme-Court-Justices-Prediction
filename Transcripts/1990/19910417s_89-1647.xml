            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73978">The opinion of the Court in No. 89-1647, Carnival Cruise Lines versus Shute will be announced by Justice Blackmun.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="9.549" offset="112117">The respondents, Mr. and Mrs. Shute, live in the State of Washington and they had purchased passage for a pleasure cruise on a ship owned by the petitioner, Carnival Cruise Lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.921" offset="169586">And the tickets contained a clause designating Florida Courts as the place for the resolution of any dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.129" offset="206471">The respondents boarded the cruise ship in Los Angeles, and on the cruise, Mrs. Shute was injured in a fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.278" offset="239072">She filed suite in Federal Court in the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.205" offset="254745">It granted summary judgment for the cruise line.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.644" offset="268538">The Ninth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.039" offset="278047">It held that the forum-selection clause should not be enforced because it was not freely bargained for and because the plaintiffs were physically and financially incapable in pursuing the litigation in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.287" offset="335098">In an opinion filed today with the clerk, we reverse that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.031" offset="354011">It is true that a freely negotiated forum-selection clause of course should be given full effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.974" offset="389851">This clause, however, was not the subject of bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.543" offset="412107">But nevertheless, a responsible forum clause in a forum contract of this kind may be permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.024" offset="441991">If this happens, a cruise could subject for lying to litigation in several places, so the cruise line has a special interest in limiting these fora.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.141" offset="490474">Further, the clause is the helpful effect of sparing time and expense and determining where suits may be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.965" offset="521821">The present dispute does not an essentially a local one inherently more suited to resolution in Washington than in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.368" offset="551392">The Shutes do not claim lack of notice of the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.521" offset="568006">They have not sustained, in our view, the heavy burden required to set aside the clause on grounds of inconvenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.356" offset="603323">These clauses are subject to judicial scrutiny for fundamental fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.811" offset="629132">There is no indication here that petitioner selected Florida to discourage the pursuit of legitimate claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.552" offset="664136">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion and is joined therein by Justice Marshall.</text>
