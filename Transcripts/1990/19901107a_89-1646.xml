            <text syncTime="58.611" offset="354148">In this case the respondents brought an action against Dr. William Marshall, a U.S. Army physician, alleging malpractice occurring while Dr. Marshall was stationed overseas in Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.500" offset="421753">The Government moved to substitute the United States as defendant, because Dr. Marshall was acting in the scope of his employment at the time of the acts complained of, and moved to dismiss the action because under an exception to the Tort Claims Act for claims arising in a foreign country, recovery could not be had against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.609" offset="530213">The motions were granted by the district court, and on appeal, the court of appeals reversed, holding that the provision requiring substitution of the United States and precluding an action against the individual did not apply when an exception to the Tort Claims Act barred recovery against the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="195.968" offset="903555">We do believe that the case presents two very closely related questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.363" offset="929155">One is whether the Tort Reform Act of 1988 in its own terms applies to require substitution of the United States and precludes an action against Dr. Marshall in the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.714" offset="998536">We submit, in disagreement with the court below, that it plainly does, both in the light of the language of the statute, its clearly expressed purpose, and its history.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.112" offset="1044198">The second question in the case, which is the question you, Justice O'Connor, referred to, is whether the Gonzalez Act of 1976 precludes the application of the reform act in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.191" offset="1104489">Our position is that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.736" offset="1122670">That there is no conflict between the provisions of the Gonzalez Act and the broad protection afforded by the Reform Act, and that in the event of any conflict the provisions of the Reform Act are required to--</text>

            <text syncTime="272.518" offset="1209815">And I think that's a critical point of disagreement between us and the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.233" offset="1228623">The respondents attempt to suggest throughout their brief a point which was not at all the basis of the decision below, and that is that they are pursuing a remedy under the Gonzalez Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.531" offset="1281808">They are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.461" offset="1289540">That was evident from their complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.594" offset="1298108">The basis of their assertion of Federal jurisdiction was diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.048" offset="1319947">They allege malpractice by the doctor under Italian law, under California law, and under something described as general American law, which perhaps was an effort to resuscitate Swift against Tyson, but was clearly not a reference to the Gonzalez Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.439" offset="1397478">What the Gonzalez Act does, we submit, is to protect physicians in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.904" offset="1423392">First and most significantly, it protects physicians against suit by... requiring the substitution of the United States as a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.892" offset="1479294">And indeed, the Fifth Circuit held a few years ago that that preclusion, that protection, applied under the circumstances of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="365.451" offset="1581485">The court below held that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.492" offset="1593710">We are not objecting to that ruling here.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.033" offset="1607816">A number of courts have held that in contrast to the powers--</text>

            <text syncTime="770.793" offset="3202853">And we, I'm sure, would be here today making the same argument if (b)(4) were not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.288" offset="3220825">But we think that (b)(4) confirms the natural reading of (b)(1) that the action can go forward, must go forward, subject to the limitations and exceptions of the act itself, including those in 2680.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.249" offset="3284773">Indeed that's confirmed by the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.010" offset="3299715">The House Committee report said, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="798.252" offset="3312776">"Any claim against the Government that is precluded by the exceptions in 2680 is also precluded against an employee, or his or her estate. "</text>
            <text syncTime="809.019" offset="3355826">We also believe that that reading is consistent with the legislative findings that were made in the Reform Act, that were incorporated in the act in section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.507" offset="3397726">Those findings start by suggesting that this Court's decision in Westfall against Erwin, which had... just previously been announced, seriously eroded the common law immunity previously available to... Federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.470" offset="3473586">In the view of Congress, the erosion of that immunity had created an immediate crisis, and I am reading again from the findings</text>
            <text syncTime="847.984" offset="3511620">"involving the prospect of liability and the threat of protracted litigation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="854.168" offset="3536384">So, Justice Stevens, to return to an earlier question of yours, Congress was concerned not only with the threat of liability, but with the threat of protracted personal tort litigation for the entire Federal work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.170" offset="3600437">And Congress does not suggest in doing that that the employees whose conduct falls within the exceptions of section 2680 are in any sense different from Federal employees whose conduct is subject to, not only to suit under the Tort Claims Act, but to recovery as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.604" offset="3694164">And the findings go on to say that granting broad protection to individual employees is necessary to the morale and well-being of the Federal work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.283" offset="3740871">I should emphasize, if I may, that the respondents at the end of their brief have seriously overstated the consequences of the position that the Government is urging here.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.640" offset="3794265">They suggest that the effect is to... really is to leave the respondents without any remedy whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.216" offset="3824567">It is true that our position is that respondents cannot recover either under Federal or State law in court for the wrongs they allege.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.146" offset="3872319">But they do have a remedy, they did at the time, and they still do, under the Military Claims Act, 10 U.S.C. Section 2733.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.170" offset="3912443">Millions of dollars are paid every year under that statute on the basis of claims of malpractice in situations where the recovery is not available under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1222.269" offset="5008750">That is, the question what the... phrase absence of a remedy means was much debated in the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.865" offset="5035186">We think it's been resolved by the new provisions of the Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.748" offset="5058696">But under the old provisions, it was held under the Drivers Act by several courts that the phrase the absence of a remedy referred to the availability under 1346 of a suit against the United States and not to the possibility that there might be internal exceptions within the act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.352" offset="5149184">So that the only situation which a remedy was absent in the view of those courts was where the employee was not acting within the scope of his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.509" offset="5185756">If I may return to a point which I think was implicit in your earlier question, the issue whether the broad scope of the Reform Act is in any way limited by the Gonzalez Act, we think is illuminated by the fact that the Reform Act itself contains two very specific exceptions in subsection (b)(2): an action may be brought against an individual for a violation of the Constitution, a Bivens action which, of course, is not this case, or may be brought against an individual for a violation of the statute of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.327" offset="5357015">I don't want to rehearse my earlier effort to answer Justice O'Connor, but we do think it's clear that this action against Dr. Marshall is not an action for a violation of the statute of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.318" offset="5408946">The complaint that was filed in the case clearly did not regard it as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.449" offset="5433501">Now this Court has said in Andrews against Glover and a number of other cases that when there is a specific enumerated exception in an act, this Court should be very reluctant to apply an additional exception in the absence of very clear legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.592" offset="5510092">We submit that there is no such legislative intent, either clear or cloudy in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.616" offset="5538200">Now, the respondents try to answer that by invoking another doctrine of statutory construction, the doctrine involving a presumption against implied repeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.605" offset="5590131">We have attempted, I think, already to explain why in our view there is no implied repeal in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.501" offset="5625762">Not only is there still room for the Gonzalez Act itself to operate, but the Gonzalez Act itself simply authorized indemnification of a physician when in fact a physician was held liable under the provisions of some other law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.555" offset="5709981">So that if the other law under which a doctor might be held liable prevents the suit against the doctor, that simply reduces the need for indemnification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.874" offset="5763271">It does not, in our view, in any way repeal the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.536" offset="5777899">We do, however, go on in our brief, and I would like to underscore that to the extent this Court believes there is any tension or conflict between that provision of the Gonzalez Act and the broad scope of the Reform Act, that this case, like the case of Gordon against the New York Stock Exchange and other cases, is a case where the later statute must be given precedence if it's to be given its full scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.253" offset="5892734">There is no doubt, we believe, that Congress intended to protect Federal employees not only from liability but from the threat of protracted litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.924" offset="5947382">That's made very specific in the finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.305" offset="5956995">That purpose would be severely undermined if the Gonzalez Act, however it might be read, were to undercut the language of the... the language and purpose of the Reform Act in this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Walter A. Oleniewski</label>
            <text syncTime="2181.513" offset="8845824">I think, Your Honor, that the question presented in the petition wasn't necessarily the decision that was reached by the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.218" offset="8884590">The Ninth Circuit did, as you pointed out earlier, did mention in passing that there was no remedy available under the Federal Tort Claims Act, and that's why Dr. Marshall is not immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.526" offset="8933805">But I also indicate that because this is an incident that occurred in a foreign country, and because the Federal Tort Claims Act and Congress recognize that does not extent to a foreign country, that is why in this situation the Reform Act does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.850" offset="9011127">With regard to the Reform Act, there seems again to be some discussion about what the respondents' position is with regard to 28 U.S.C. 2679(b)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.901" offset="9087300">That is the provision that has the two exceptions within the Reform Act, the two exceptions being to bring a suit against a Federal employee in his individual capacity either for a violation of the Constitution of the United States or, two, for a violation of a statute of the United States under which such action against the individual is otherwise authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.910" offset="9203388">Now, although Government seems to think we don't rely upon that statute, we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.075" offset="9232019">Obviously we did not rely upon that statute when the lawsuit was filed, because the lawsuit was filed more than a year before the statute was enacted, and obviously we could not have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.093" offset="9276113">The statute was not enacted until this matter had already gone through the district court and was in the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.357" offset="9309132">But it's clear that the statutes that Congress contemplated had to include, among others, the Gonzalez Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.517" offset="9361795">The only legislative history that we have from Congress on that talks in terms of preserving legal remedies that existed before, not changing any legal remedies that existed before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.788" offset="9430863">And so as they were passing this legislation to protect what they perceived was a change in the law caused by this Court's decision in Westfall v. Erwin, they did not change any of the other statutes that already existed, among them the Gonzalez Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.010" offset="9511738">Now, the use of the term "violation", I am not sure why Congress used that word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.627" offset="9550190">There is no mention in the legislative history why they used that word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.290" offset="9572864">It's a shorthand term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.652" offset="9578298">Certainly with regard to the Constitution you can't bring an action against someone for violating the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.100" offset="9612153">You bring an action against someone for violating the rights that another person has under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.823" offset="9639006">And for the same logic, the law... violation of a statute of the United States would also say that you can sue an individual where there has been a violation of a statute where this Federal statute permitted a remedy against the individual doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.126" offset="9716224">Again, the Gonzalez Act, 1089(f).</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.177" offset="9724479">There's been some discussion also about whether or not a remedy has been created.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.419" offset="9789367">Clearly before the Westfall legislation was enacted, the Gonzalez Act did permit, under 1089(f), a doctor to be indemnified, which obviously meant, according to the Ninth Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit, that he could be sued in his individual capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.693" offset="9882468">But before the Newman decision, the Government relied upon cases like Powers v. Schultz, and in those cases they were making the same argument that they're making now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.622" offset="9938265">And the argument there was that there was only a remedy if you could be sued in a foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.048" offset="9971911">That was rejected by Newman, that was rejected by Smith, and the Westfall legislation doesn't in any way indicate that those interpretations should be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.106" offset="10024156">In the case of Powers v. Schultz, when the Government won that decision, the plaintiff was dismissed from court and there was no remedy for that plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.406" offset="10081312">Under Newman and under Smith, because the doctor was allowed to be sued in his individual capacity, it allowed a suit to proceed against the doctor and for a potential remedy against the doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.646" offset="10142334">We believe that there is sufficient rationale in the holding of the Smith case, and particularly as it applies to adopting the holding in Newman v. Soballe, that the Gonzalez Act is still a viable statute, and as a viable statute, a remedy is available against the doctor individually, regardless of where the suit is filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2571.331" offset="10405021">In the Gonzalez Act, the remand provision under 1089(c) is a remand of a case to State court where there is no remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.006" offset="10447757">The Drivers Act, as it existed, did not have similar language.</text>
