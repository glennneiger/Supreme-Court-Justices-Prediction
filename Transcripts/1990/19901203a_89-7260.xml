            <text>We'll hear argument this morning in No. 89-7260, William J. Burns against the United States.</text>
            <text>Mr. Goldblatt.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_h_goldblatt">
            <label>Mr. Steven H. Goldblatt</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>This is a Federal sentencing guidelines case.</text>
            <text>Mr. Burns was sentenced to 60 months' imprisonment, although the judge, the presentence investigator, and the parties all agree that the appropriate guideline range for the case is 30 to 37 months' imprisonment.</text>
            <text>Neither the parties or the presentence investigator identified any grounds that might justify departure from the appropriate guideline range as that terms is defined by statute.</text>
            <text>It was not until sentence was imposed, however, that the judge indicated that she disagreed with that assessment and in fact found at least three grounds which did justify departure.</text>
            <text>She at that point immediately imposed sentence of 60 months' imprisonment and directed the defendant to step back with the marshal.</text>
            <text>The issue that is before the Court today is whether or not the judge was obliged to alert the parties that she had found three grounds for departure that no one had identified so as to allow comment on whether or not departure was appropriate before sentence was imposed.</text>
            <text>We make this argument both under rule 32(a)(1) of the Federal rules of criminal procedure and, alternatively, as a matter of fundamental due process.</text>
            <text>Rule 32(a)(1) was amended at the same time that Congress passed the Sentence Reform Act of 1984 to provide as follows, and I will quote for this purpose.</text>
            <text>"At the sentencing hearing the court shall afford counsel for the defendant and the attorney for the Government an opportunity to comment upon the probation officer's determination and on other matters relating to the appropriate sentence."</text>
            <text>The court goes on to provide that the court shall also afford counsel for both sides and the defendant the opportunity to address the court.</text>
            <text>It is our argument that under the circumstances presented here, where the judge is the only person who has identified grounds for departure, that the judge must alert the parties to that fact, otherwise the court is not affording the parties the opportunity to comment on a matter that is very much relating to the appropriate sentence.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Goldblatt, I would have thought that every defendant would be on notice that a judge could give a sentence any place within the range, that it could be enhanced or otherwise.</text>
            <text>I mean, the sentencing scheme contemplates that.</text>
            <text>Why isn't that the kind of notice you need?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_h_goldblatt">
            <label>Mr. Steven H. Goldblatt</label>
            <text>Justice O'Connor, the reason that I think that that notice is not adequate is because the guidelines contemplate that, for most cases I would submit, that the sentence should be within the guideline range and that it requires unusual circumstances before the judge can depart from the range which have to be identified for the record and are subject to appeal.</text>
            <text>It is a complex enough decision that without some guidance, it would be almost impossible for a lawyer to pick up the guideline manual and identify any possible grounds for departure.</text>
            <text>Thus, the presentence investigator in preparing the presentence report, which the parties are entitled to see... at least this part of it... is directed under the rule to identify any grounds which might justify departure without regard to whether the investigator believes they ought to be used.</text>
            <text>Thus, I would submit that in the situation where that investigator says there are no grounds for departure... that might justify departure... counsel truly is not on notice.</text>
            <text>I think it's also important to bear in mind that the guideline manual, or the guideline system, contemplates two types of departure: those that are recognized either in the 5 case series, aspects of the crime, those that involve the prior criminal history under the 4 series.</text>
            <text>But also the judge also has the ability to depart for reasons that the judge determines were not considered at all by the sentencing commission.</text>
            <text>Therefore, in that circumstance the defendant or the defense counsel would have to look at their record in the case to attempt to identify is there anything here that wasn't taken into consideration.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Did you take the position they were factual inquiries that you wished to address?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_h_goldblatt">
            <label>Mr. Steven H. Goldblatt</label>
            <text>No, Justice Kennedy, I think we acknowledge that the underlying facts that there can be some debate as to whether we knew that there was a substantial impairment of governmental function when none was identified in the presentence report.</text>
            <text>But I don't think there's any factual matter that we wish to contest that the fundamental facts are incorrect.</text>
            <text>However, what we would have contested had we had the opportunity... I think it's a reasonable conclusion of the record... would have been whether there were reasonable grounds for departure and whether it was appropriate under the circumstances and even assuming that there were grounds for departure, whether or not departure to the extent that the judge in fact departed, which is some 42 percent over the guideline range maximum, was necessary under the circumstances.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>It's somewhat paradoxical that this right had not been identified, at least in our jurisprudence, before the Sentencing Guidelines Act.</text>
            <text>And the Sentencing Guidelines Act now limits the district court's discretion and yet you would say that we impose more restrictions on how the sentencing procedures should be conducted.</text>
            <text>That seems paradoxical to me.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_h_goldblatt">
            <label>Mr. Steven H. Goldblatt</label>
            <text>Justice Kennedy, I would submit that in this circumstance, I would... I would... it's important I think to underscore that we are not requesting that the Court construe the guidelines and the rules as requiring a judge in all circumstances to announce to the parties that the court is considering a departure.</text>
            <text>This only comes up in the situation presented here where no one, other than the judge, has identified grounds for departure, and in fact, the presentence investigator has indicated that there are none.</text>
            <text>It is only in that circumstance that we submit that the obligation under rule 32(a) to afford the parties the opportunity to comment on matters relating to the appropriate sentence cannot be exercised unless the court indicates in one fashion or another that the court disagrees with it... other people's conclusions... and that there is a ground for departure.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Of course, under the old system, following up on Justice Kennedy's question, you would have perhaps a recommended sentence from either the probation officer or maybe from the Government and yet the court had just a complete latitude within the statutory limits.</text>
            <text>No one ever thought that you had to have notice as to what the district court had in mind.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_h_goldblatt">
            <label>Mr. Steven H. Goldblatt</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, that is correct, and I would submit that not only did anybody think of it, I don't think he would have had the right.</text>
            <text>But I think that's one of the things that the Congress attempted to change with guidelines sentencing.</text>
            <text>There are two concepts here.</text>
            <text>One was to restrict the discretion of the district court because of what Congress found to be unconscionable disparity in sentencing.</text>
            <text>But also to inject a large measure of fairness in the process that did not previously exist.</text>
            <text>Under rule 32(c), the defense right to access to the presentence report and their right to challenge matters in that report, factual... actually the right of both sides to challenge it... has no parallel in previous sentence existence in the Federal system.</text>
            <text>And our point is that under this guideline system it was changed so that one of the key factors is that the parties are to have meaningful participation.</text>
            <text>I guess the best analogy I can draw is that if the presentence investigator had identified any grounds for departure, that had to go in the report.</text>
            <text>If it did, the defense would have been on notice.</text>
            <text>They could have challenged the factual premises for it.</text>
            <text>They could have prepared for the sentencing hearing and presented arguments that... such as we suggested in our brief to try and convince the judge that it was either inappropriate to depart or, if the judge was going to report, to try and reduce the amount the judge would depart.</text>
            <text>That is consistent with how the guidelines are supposed to operate.</text>
            <text>Informed participation by the parties is essential.</text>
            <text>Yes?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Focusing, Mr. Goldblatt, focusing on this case, what is there that Mr. Addis could have said to Judge Johnson if he had known about her intent to depart that he didn't say and that wasn't already raised in the court of appeals on appeal... in this case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_h_goldblatt">
            <label>Mr. Steven H. Goldblatt</label>
            <text>Justice Blackmun, what counsel could have said I believe, addressing the three grounds here... we have three grounds: duration, concealment, and significant disruption of governmental function.</text>
            <text>Duration is a factor that was not considered by the guideline commission at all as a grounds for departure, so it's a judge-directed departure.</text>
            <text>With that, I think counsel could have argued to the court that duration, in essence, is captured in the guidelines because they allow the relation back to the events... so in this case it was over 6 years, the duration of the crime as how it was aggregated to over $1.2 million.</text>
            <text>And that's what raised the level of the crime, I believe, to level 19 and that this really wasn't something different than what the guidelines had already factored into it.</text>
            <text>With regard to concealment, which relates to the tax evasion to cover up the crime, although that is covered by 5K29 of the departure grounds, it was also a basis for enhancing the level of the tax fraud by two levels, so it was in that sense already considered by the guideline commission.</text>
            <text>And with regard to significant disruption of a governmental function, counsel could have and should have argued that this type of disruption of a governmental function is inappropriate for departure or is not required since almost any crime that involves the Federal Government will disrupt it in some way or another.</text>
            <text>And this should not be considered significant.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Goldblatt, do you have to... does the judge have to be specific or does he just have to say I'm going to go outside of the guidelines?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_h_goldblatt">
            <label>Mr. Steven H. Goldblatt</label>
            <text>Justice Marshall, I would submit that what the judge would need to do would be to alert the parties by indicating the grounds of the departure in advance in such a way that the parties could comment on that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="steven_h_goldblatt">
            <label>Mr. Steven H. Goldblatt</label>
            <text>I think it would be done on a case-by-case basis.</text>
            <text>In this case I don't think it would require much more than I am considering the duration of the crimes, the facts that they were concealed--</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven H. Goldblatt</label>
            <text>--In... certainly if it's... there are many circumstances where you wouldn't.</text>
            <text>Since the premise is rule 32(a)(1) that the court has to afford an opportunity to comment.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="steven_h_goldblatt">
            <label>Mr. Steven H. Goldblatt</label>
            <text>Because in this case, there was no indication to alert the parties to the type of argument they should--</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven H. Goldblatt</label>
            <text>The reason, I think, Justice Scalia, is before the guidelines went into effect no statutory rights were created or expectation.</text>
            <text>It is precisely because of the situation you describe, where the parties had no rights at all at the proceeding to know anything, that these guidelines came into effect because Congress determined that sentencing as it existed in the Federal system, pre-guidelines, produced unwarranted disparity.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, they had a right to non-arbitrary decision making and you say that it's, it's simply arbitrary decision making to use a reason for putting somebody in prison for a longer period of time that the individual has had no reason to, to address.</text>
            <text>It seems to me that was... if that unlawfully arbitrary under this regime, it was unlawfully so under the earlier one.</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven H. Goldblatt</label>
            <text>Justice Scalia, the distinction I would draw there is I think that the guidelines create a structure whereby the parties are entitled to participate in this process to try and persuade the judge and influence the decisional process.</text>
            <text>I'm not suggesting, and we have not indeed argued on... in this appeal... that the judge's decisions were unreasonable.</text>
            <text>What I am suggesting is there are alternatives that may also may be reasonable and in fact are reasonable that should have been presented to the court before she made her decision.</text>
            <text>Then she would made her decision, and that is very much what the guidelines were attempting to create.</text>

            <text>And it is anomalous to suggest that in the situation where no one has identified it, where there is no alerting of the parties to the possibility that departure may be there, that the court should not afford that opportunity but should back silently, listening to argument that really has nothing to do--</text>

            <text>--No, no.</text>
            <text>It's the judge alone that is doing it.</text>
            <text>And I would submit... I would submit what you're asking for is informed participation, the ability to comment on a matter relating to the appropriate sentence.</text>
            <text>Here, this record, I think, amply demonstrates that counsel really didn't have the opportunity to comment on departure.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Suppose the judge said, counsel, I've been considering this over the weekend and I want you to know before you address the court that I am considering departing from the guidelines to increase the sentence.</text>
            <text>Is that sufficient?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_h_goldblatt">
            <label>Mr. Steven H. Goldblatt</label>
            <text>Assuming the judge also indicated the basis for the departure.</text>
            <text>In other words, if the judge said, I'm considering departing because of the duration of these crimes, then I think courts have upheld that it's been adequate unless counsel at that point raises an objection that they need more time to address the question of departure.</text>
            <text>But that type of notice can be consistent with what rule 32(a) requires.</text>
            <text>And in fact, this is the rule that exists in some six circuits at this point.</text>
            <text>The D.C. Circuit is the only circuit that has held otherwise.</text>
            <text>And I think the premise is largely that one of the major changes that the guidelines bring into the process is informed participation by the parties.</text>
            <text>The Government itself has on two occasions filed appeals where they have been deprived of notice of a downward departure.</text>
            <text>And as the Court is aware, these appeals were part of the approval of the Attorney General or the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text>Under this guideline scheme, the ability to make the arguments as to whether or not departure is appropriate is essential to effective representation of the defendant or the Government and also is an important tool in assuring that you don't have unwarranted departures.</text>
            <text>It may well be that in this case the judge would have departed anyway had she heard from counsel.</text>
            <text>But the question is would it have been 60 months, might it have been 58 months, might it have been 57 months?</text>
            <text>It's impossible to tell.</text>
            <text>But this type of process ensures that the court will get the best arguments on both sides.</text>
            <text>And what happens here that does not occur.</text>
            <text>Counsel's argument, as the transcript reveals, had nothing to do with departures.</text>
            <text>It was a generalized discussion which Judge Newman in the United States v. Kim cite... said in our brief in the Second Circuit indicated almost invariably as what's going to happen if you don't have notice of the possibility of departure.</text>
            <text>You'll simply make and argument identifying the mitigating circumstances and that will be it.</text>
            <text>But when you have notice that the judge is considering various factors, it requires you to marshal what the guideline commission considered, what it didn't consider, and make the best possible arguments that are almost the equivalent of a mixed question of law.</text>
            <text>In fact, it's not a straight factual argument.</text>

            <text>And the Government very--</text>
            <text>But I think the most telling thing about the Government appealing is they recognized as well that this type of notice is essential to preparing for sentencing proceeding.</text>
            <text>And it's important... there's no question that under traditional sentencing the types of rights I'm talking about would not even be discussed.</text>
            <text>The case wouldn't be here.</text>
            <text>The guidelines change the calculus.</text>

            <text>Certainly the guidelines restricted the discretion of district courts, but they didn't impose a requirement of notice.</text>
            <text>They reimposed a requirement that you have to give your reasons specifically, and the district judge did.</text>

            <text>Mr. Goldblatt, if you extend this rule 30... 32(a) which requires the counsel to be given notice of what the probation officer's determination is with respect to the guidelines, if you extend that to the judge, you come out with something quite different from what you're urging us to do, and something much more sensible, I might add.</text>
            <text>That is, you come up with a situation in which the judge tells counsel... not... he doesn't say coyly, I'm thinking of departing from the guidelines, and then counsel has to guess, you know, on what basis.</text>
            <text>You would come up with something in which the rule would read, the judge shall make his determination, tentatively, as is done in the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text>You make a tentative determination and then counsel has an opportunity to argue that your basis for departure was wrong.</text>
            <text>But there's nothing remotely like that here.</text>
            <text>And what you're arguing for seems to me something so, so strange that the judge just says, I just want you to know that I'm thinking of departing from the guideline.</text>
            <text>And counsel says, but why, Your Honor, and he says, well, I don't have to tell you that.</text>

            <text>The courts that have addressed it have suggested that certainly is the better procedure, but since everybody is grounded it on 32(a)(1), it's a case-by-case determination as to whether or not you were deprived of an opportunity to comment.</text>

            <text>Everybody realized that's got to be spent.</text>

            <text>In most situations there will not be postponements of proceedings.</text>
            <text>The decision to depart has to be formulated too carefully.</text>
            <text>Most judges, as was the case, I think, here, have to think about it before they come to the proceeding.</text>
            <text>It's a very complex decision and also in most situations it will be identified either by the presentence investigator or the parties.</text>

Eldridge as to whether or not the notice requirement materially aids... reduces the risk of error.</text>
            <text>So in that situation, even if the rule did not provide it, the Court could conclude, as it often does in due process situations, that meaningful notice and an opportunity to comment are fundamental protections of any liberty interest.</text>
            <text>So--</text>

            <text>--Yes, I would submit that the guideline range by using the mandatory language in 3553(b) that the court shall sentence within the guideline range is a substantial departure from previously existing sentencing law in the Federal system and that it does create a protectable interest and that in the circumstances presented here the defendant should have the right to address that, the departure from it.</text>
            <text>And because he perceived no notice here and did not address it, that he's entitled to resentencing.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen J. Marzen</label>
            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>The question in this case is whether district judges conducting sentencing hearings must be required to comply with new procedures imposed by appellate courts developed through case-by-case litigation rather than through the traditional amendment process.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Marzen, what if the judge makes a downward departure?</text>
            <text>Is it the Government's position that it is entitled to notice?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_j_marzen">
            <label>Mr. Stephen J. Marzen</label>

            <text>Our--</text>
            <text>[Laughter]</text>
            <text>If you do say defendants have the right, we would certainly in a subsequent case say that would have a right.</text>
            <text>As the first matter though we do not... it... the position of the acting Solicitor General is that it... no notice is required.</text>
            <text>The two cases in which Assistant U.S. Attorneys have requested that in briefs, the Goff case and the Jagmohan, the... excuse me... the appeal was authorized only on the substantive departure.</text>
            <text>There was no authorization to appeal on the notice issue And that's about all I can say.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>So you don't stand by the argument the Government's attorneys made in those cases?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen J. Marzen</label>
            <text>Not at all.</text>
            <text>We're a big department, and we authorize appeals.</text>
            <text>We don't review briefs before they're filed, and in this case this may have been an instance where we should have seen the brief before they were filed.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Marzen, what's your response, apropos of that point... what's your response to Mr. Goldblatt's argument that the reason he, his client has a due process right is that his client has been the beneficiary of a new liberty interest created by the guidelines.</text>
            <text>The Government doesn't have a new liberty interest, does it?</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Are you saying that you would be entitled to notice is simply a matte of evenhanded interpretation of the guidelines but not as a matter of due process?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_j_marzen">
            <label>Mr. Stephen J. Marzen</label>
            <text>--Justice Souter, if I understand the due process argument it's that to minimize risk of error, notice is required.</text>
            <text>That, I think, would apply evenhandedly to the defendant as well as to the Government, because there could be erroneous downward departures against the Government just as there could be erroneous upward departures against the defendant.</text>
            <text>So if the theory is, and I take it the position in petitioner's brief which we vehemently disagree with, but to the extent that position is accepted, it would apply as well to the Government as it would to the defendant.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Yes, but the Government isn't guaranteed due process of law.</text>

          <turn speaker="stephen_j_marzen">
            <label>Mr. Stephen J. Marzen</label>
            <text>That's an interesting point.</text>
            <text>To the extent that the sentencing is to get a just sentence though and a just sentence would require a departure in that case, I suppose then we might well argue that it requires notice to both parties.</text>
            <text>But--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Marzen, in the briefs that you vehemently disapproved of filed by the U.S. attorneys in the cases seeking... did they rely on the constitutional argument or the interpretation of rule 32(a)(1), do you know?</text>

          <turn speaker="stephen_j_marzen">
            <label>Mr. Stephen J. Marzen</label>
            <text>--I haven't reviewed those briefs myself.</text>
            <text>It seems from the way the court has discussed those briefs that they were only based on the rule and as well it seemed they were both basically trying to evoke circuit precedent that had been developed in favor of defendants... in favor of the Government in that case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And the rule does expressly refer to both counsel for the defendant and counsel for the Government, doesn't it?</text>

          <turn speaker="stephen_j_marzen">
            <label>Mr. Stephen J. Marzen</label>
            <text>Yes, which, which and there's also a decision made when Congress adopted the appellate review provision to allow Government... the Government to appeal as well as the defendant.</text>
            <text>So the rule does have... the rule and the guidelines themselves reflect an evenhandedness that would require this same treatment to defendants and to the Government.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Marzen, while I've got you interrupted, do you happen to know... there are, you know, thousands and thousands of sentences imposed in the Federal system.</text>
            <text>What percentage of the cases under the guidelines actually involve departures?</text>
            <text>Is it a substantial number?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_j_marzen">
            <label>Mr. Stephen J. Marzen</label>
            <text>There are a total... all the figure are as follows.</text>
            <text>82 percent of cases are sentenced within the guidelines.</text>
            <text>12.2 of the remaining 18 percent of cases are sentenced outside the guidelines.</text>
            <text>There are about... there are approximately 2.49 downward departures against the Government for every one departure upward.</text>
            <text>The balance of the sentences are departures on motion of the Government for substantial assistance after the sentence had been meted out.</text>
            <text>And that is... all in the 1989 annual report of the sentencing commission.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Marzen, you really haven't had a chance to give your argument yet and I am in part to blame for that.</text>
            <text>I just want to know are you going to address the issue of the existence of a new liberty interest under the rule as argued by your brother?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_j_marzen">
            <label>Mr. Stephen J. Marzen</label>
            <text>Certainly, maybe I can comment on that just briefly now.</text>
            <text>As I understand it in rejecting the sort of bitter with the sweet notion, at least a majority of the court has, there's a bifurcation of the decision-making process.</text>
            <text>One first determines whether the due process clause applies, then the court determines what processes do.</text>
            <text>In this case, I would think the defendant has a constitutional liberty interest in his sentence.</text>
            <text>That's why this Court in cases such as Townsend v. Burk have required that the right to counsel extends to the sentencing hearing and requires that the court base its sentence on materially correct information.</text>
            <text>So the due process clause has always applied to sentencing, before and after the guidelines.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But I think... maybe I misunderstand him, I thought Mr. Goldblatt was arguing that there had been some new liberty interest created by the guidelines themselves and he's saying that in part to avoid the problem of having someone come back to him and say, well, why are you in any different position today from the position you were in for due process purposes before?</text>
            <text>So I think the argument is that there's something new here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_j_marzen">
            <label>Mr. Stephen J. Marzen</label>
            <text>I think that's right, but my point, Justice Souter, is that what's new goes to the first part of this Court's due process jurisprudence, whether the due process clause applies.</text>
            <text>It doesn't go to the second question, which is what processes do.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, do you concede that there is something new, that there is a new liberty interest that didn't exist before?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_j_marzen">
            <label>Mr. Stephen J. Marzen</label>
            <text>If... if the guidelines were instead to be applied by a parole commission, for example, yes, there would be something new, and under the Greenholtz decision, the parole commission may well have some minimum hearing requirements as the court determined in that case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, what about the situation we've got in which the guidelines are being applied by the court?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_j_marzen">
            <label>Mr. Stephen J. Marzen</label>
            <text>No, not by the court because sentencing judges have always had to comply with due process.</text>
            <text>Their proceedings have always had to be fundamentally fair, and I think--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>No, but again, this goes to the first question.</text>
            <text>Is there a new liberty interest created with respect to which due process must be afforded?</text>
            <text>And are you conceding that there is a new liberty interest created by the guidelines?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_j_marzen">
            <label>Mr. Stephen J. Marzen</label>
            <text>--I guess my... actually my initial answer was that it's really academic to whether there's a liberty interest, a new one, because there was one before and what processes do doesn't matter on how many liberty interests you sort of stack on, one on top of another.</text>
            <text>The language in this case, given that all that Congress adopted was a presumptive sentencing system.</text>
            <text>I don't think there really is a new liberty interest.</text>
            <text>Unlike prior cases in which... like Greenholtz, in which the Court relied very much on the shall language, Congress, in enacting the sentencing guidelines, specifically rejected flat time and mandatory sentencing processes like the State of New York's which would have given rise to an expectancy that one get a particular sentence.</text>
            <text>It rejected both that and indeterminate sentencing and instead adopted Minnesota's procedure.</text>
            <text>Minnesota's procedure was that of... was of presumptive sentencing, which was to give the judge a presumptively applicable guidelines range which the judge could depart from is he or she stated that there were certain reasons calling for either a higher or lower sentence.</text>
            <text>I don't think there's enough certainty in that system to create an expectancy to create a new liberty interest--</text>

            <text>I think they're a wonderful development and I... I've always followed them and I want you to know I believe in following them, and I never depart.</text>
            <text>And then he listens.</text>
            <text>And so they said [inaudible] I'm not going to depart.</text>
            <text>He listens to the argument.</text>
            <text>He thinks it over and after he gets all through, he says, by gosh, I never thought of that one thing.</text>
            <text>It justifies a departure.</text>
            <text>And then he departs and gives reasons.</text>

            <text>Under the prior system the judge could say, this seems like a gardenvariety robbery.</text>
            <text>I think it's worth no more than 2 years, and then the prosecutor brings out a bunch of other information or highlights the facts in a specially egregious way and says, my goodness, I think you deserve--</text>

            <text>He didn't even have to disclose the presentence report.</text>

            <text>The... Congress has gone beyond that and enacted additional reforms to make the sentence more rational and fair.</text>
            <text>The perversity of the due process argument in this case is that if there are absolutely no holds barred, if the judge... district judge had absolutely unfettered discretion, then that's fundamentally fair.</text>
            <text>But now that Congress has gone beyond that and given a guidelines range, a right to appeal, and the other rights provided under the sentencing guidelines, all of a sudden that's not fair or is at least an invitation for the, the court under a cost benefit analysis to--</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen J. Marzen</label>

            <text>It's not a flat range that judges are limited to.</text>
            <text>It's a range that is limited based on certain factors and if those factors aren't adequately considered in the guidelines, the judges can depart.</text>
            <text>That was the basis of departure in this very case.</text>
            <text>And there are at least five mechanisms within the current procedure that make that fair.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And if the guidelines say you can... you can reduce the sentence by 2 years for youth of the offender, a particular judge can say, well, no, I'm going to reduce it 3.</text>
            <text>Can he do that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_j_marzen">
            <label>Mr. Stephen J. Marzen</label>
            <text>--No, no, no, that's not... the guidelines are a bit more specific than that.</text>
            <text>In this case, for example, there was an upward departure on the basis of concealment.</text>
            <text>The guideline assumed that the income tax evasion, the concealment, was $10,000 or more... or more.</text>
            <text>Petitioner evaded income taxes to the tunes of almost half a million dollars or 50 times what the guidelines presupposed.</text>
            <text>That was one basis for departure.</text>
            <text>The other basis for departure was for duration.</text>
            <text>The guidelines specified, "more than minimal planning".</text>
            <text>In this case, there was much, much, much more than minimal planning.</text>
            <text>The guideline presupposed that it would be planning typical for a "simple offense".</text>
            <text>And this is on pages 14a and 17a of the appendix to petitioner's opening brief.</text>
            <text>But the simple of... this was far more than a simple offense.</text>
            <text>This was 8 years of embezzling more than $1.2 million from the Government via 53 fraudulent checks.</text>
            <text>That was far more than just a simple offense.</text>
            <text>So the guidelines... so the answer to your question I think is that the guidelines are much, much more specific than that.</text>
            <text>They don't say a 2-year adjustment is all you can give for youth.</text>
            <text>They provide certain point adjustments for very particular offense characteristics and very particular conduct.</text>
            <text>And conduct could well exceed what is presupposed in the guidelines, just as it happened here.</text>

            <text>I understand.</text>
            <text>All you're saying is that there are good reasons for departing here which, which could have been argued.</text>
            <text>But suppose that the amount had been $10,001.</text>
            <text>Could the judge have said, well, the guidelines say that you should increase the sentence only so much for $10,000 and above?</text>

            <text>The guidelines are not a rule that says any conduct, any income tax evasion, no matter how far above $10,000 is all accounted for in a two-point adjustment, and that's the difference between the statutory minima and maxima that was the system--</text>

            <text>They're listed... the facts are listed in the presentence report.</text>
            <text>That... in a case like this, it's very easy to tell that the guide... the facts presupposed in the guidelines don't adequately take into account the conduct for which the petitioner was convicted.</text>
            <text>This case is an excellent example.</text>
            <text>On pages 41 and 45 of the joint appendix, it's very clear that petitioner's counsel knew that an upward departure was a possibility in this case.</text>
            <text>He urged the court to consider a sentence "within the guidelines", and he argued that all the aggravating factors were adequately accounted for in the guidelines.</text>
            <text>If the court wants to hear more on this, it can specifically invite further comment.</text>
            <text>If the defendant is surprised, he can file... he can object upon hearing the sentence.</text>
            <text>As petitioner did here with respect to whether he could voluntarily surrender, petitioner in fact essentially told the district judge, on pages 60 and 61 of the joint appendix, that he was going to file an appeal on the departure issue but chose not to argue that question before the district judge and instead argued whether he should be able to--</text>

            <text>And the reason for that is that there are two sentences in rule 32(a)(1) and we've only talked about one this morning.</text>
            <text>The one we've talked about is the comment sentence.</text>

          <turn speaker="stephen_j_marzen">
            <label>Mr. Stephen J. Marzen</label>
            <text>There's a sentence that immediately precedes it called a notice sentence.</text>
            <text>And this is all at pages 7a and 8a in the appendix to petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text>The notice sentence specifically says that the parties get notice of the probation officer's determination pursuant to subdivision (c)(2)(b) of the guidelines' range and the offender characteristics.</text>
            <text>The comment sentence says that you have a right to comment on that determination and on other matters relating to the appropriate sentence.</text>
            <text>The curious thing is that subdivision (c)(2)(b), the cross-reference subdivision, includes the explanation of the probation officer of whether there is a fair ground for a departure in this case.</text>
            <text>So a fair reading of the notice sentence is the only thing that's omitted in the notice requirement in rule 32 is exactly what petitioner asks or part of what petitioner asks for here, which is some advanced notice of the departure decision.</text>
            <text>Reading the notice and the comment sentence together I think is very revealing for a couple of reasons.</text>
            <text>It very clearly says that there's a right to comment, not a right to notice.</text>
            <text>It's a right to speak your mind to the judge on anything you think that may bear on the sentence.</text>
            <text>It's not a right to be informed of what those sentencing matters are.</text>
            <text>Second, you can't imply notice in the comment sentence without making the notice sentence superfluous.</text>
            <text>In other words, if you substitute the words "notice and comment" for the word "comment", there's just no meaning for the... no purpose that's served by the notice sentence.</text>
            <text>Finally, the two sentences also reveal one other thing.</text>
            <text>The notice sentence only requires notice of the probation officer's determination.</text>
            <text>It doesn't require notice of what the judge is thinking.</text>
            <text>And with the one exemption... exception I mentioned earlier about a judge's intention to order a victim notice, there is nothing that has changed the traditional sentencing practice.</text>
            <text>The judges do not have to circulate advisory sentences for comment--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But Mr. Marzen, isn't there, isn't there a reasonable explanation for that in the fact that presumably the sentencing commission expected that virtually all sentences would conform to the guidelines or, if there were departures, that the reason for the departure would be revealed in the presentence report.</text>
            <text>It's a fairly rare situation if they put a provision like this in, wouldn't it have more or less been an invitation to departures, which they didn't really want to invite?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_j_marzen">
            <label>Mr. Stephen J. Marzen</label>
            <text>--Justice Stevens, the sentencing guidelines passed by Congress contemplated quite a few departures, in fact, about 20 percent of cases.</text>
            <text>In the Senate report it notes 71.</text>
            <text>The committee in a backhanded way says that there were 20 percent departures in the parole context.</text>
            <text>We expect about the same amount of departures here.</text>
            <text>The Senate report also cross-references to the Minnesota experience as the only State which had a system like the one that it's adopting.</text>
            <text>In Minnesota one of the sources in the footnote cites Minnesota had a departure rate of greater than 23 percent.</text>
            <text>In the statute itself in several places specifically invites judges to depart in order to individualize sentencing.</text>
            <text>So, one... I guess one can quibble about whether the glass is half empty or half full or whether 20 percent departures is big or not.</text>
            <text>But departures in one-fifth of the cases is departures in quite a few cases and underscores that this is just presumptive sentencing--</text>

            <label>Mr. Steven H. Goldblatt</label>
            <text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text>I do.</text>
            <text>For the Government implicit in their argument is that everybody knew departure was a possibility and, therefore, this came as no surprise.</text>
            <text>The Government entered a guilty plea in which it agreed that the sentencing range for this case was 30 to 37 months, and at page 6 of the joint appendix, what they didn't agree to was where the sentence would be within that range.</text>
            <text>They received a presentence report that said there was no basis for a departure from the guideline range.</text>
            <text>They signed off it, no objection.</text>
            <text>They went to the sentencing proceeding, argued on behalf of the Government, did not ask for a departure from the guidelines, did not state any grounds for departure.</text>
            <text>That is what happened in this case.</text>
            <text>This was not obvious to anyone.</text>
            <text>This was not implicit in what was going on.</text>
            <text>The parties had agreed they had enough evidence to sink a battleship, so it's not a question of a guilty plea because of thin evidence.</text>
            <text>That's what they agreed to.</text>
            <text>That's what they determined the case was.</text>
            <text>And what happened here is certainly not what Congress anticipated was going to happen.</text>
            <text>The first point for that argument is Congress thought that sentencing as it existed in the Federal system before the guidelines was in a word, lousy.</text>
            <text>They sought to change it radically.</text>
            <text>They did change it radically.</text>
            <text>And part of what they changed was their perception of what was fair.</text>
            <text>Justice Stevens, I think your point is very important that Congress anticipated that in most, if not all cases, the various grounds for sentencing would appear in the presentence report or, if not there, in the presentence report plus the parties were reacting to it.</text>

            <text>Mr. Goldblatt, do you think that the... that the possibility of the sentencing commission creating new liberty interests is consistent with our Mistretta decision, with the theory of approving the existence of that body, the ability of that body to create new liberty interests?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_h_goldblatt">
            <label>Mr. Steven H. Goldblatt</label>
            <text>I think so particularly because of the structure in which Congress... I mean, Congress is the one that really creates the liberty interest, not the sentencing commission.</text>
            <text>What Congress said was that sentences should be within that range.</text>
            <text>Congress is the one that has created the liberty interest, not the guideline commission.</text>
            <text>It's by statute that we're relying on 18, section 3553(b), so I think under that circumstance it is consistent with Mistretta.</text>
