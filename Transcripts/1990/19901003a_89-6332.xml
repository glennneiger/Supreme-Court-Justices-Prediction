            <text syncTime="65.292" offset="388480">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="67.605" offset="397780">This is a capital case that raises issues about the adherence by the State of Mississippi to this Court's rulings in Edwards v. Arizona and Michigan v. Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.453" offset="441143">The relevant facts are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.324" offset="452637">Arrested in California on the basis of capital murder warrants issued in Mississippi, Mr. Minnick was questioned by the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.410" offset="488999">His interrogation was on a Friday.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.002" offset="499344">Mr. Minnick spoke with the agents about his escape from a Mississippi prison, and refused to respond to certain questions about two Mississippi homicides for which he had been arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.849" offset="546678">Clearly, expressly, and unambiguously, Minnick on three separate occasions told the agents that he wished to have an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.647" offset="585861">Minnick's language, as recorded by the agents, and in response to their inquiry and their warning to him that he didn't have to speak unless his lawyer was present, was that they should</text>
            <text syncTime="126.435" offset="633091">"come back Monday when I have a lawyer. "</text>
            <text syncTime="129.466" offset="645211">at which time he said he would, quote... this is from the FBI report,</text>
            <text syncTime="133.738" offset="662243">"make a more complete statement then with his lawyer present. "</text>
            <text syncTime="137.652" offset="677917">The FBI agents immediately discontinued questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.615" offset="693799">Mr. Minnick spoke to assigned counsel over the weekend.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.335" offset="708637">Early Monday morning, a sheriff from Mississippi appeared at the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.689" offset="726087">Minnick's jailers told him that he had to go downstairs and talk to him, and that he could not refuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.104" offset="751687">The Mississippi Supreme Court made a precise, factual finding, not in dispute on this appeal, that, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="162.977" offset="779167">"the jailers told Minnick that he would have to go down and talk with Denham. "</text>
            <text syncTime="167.151" offset="795886">who was the sheriff.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.410" offset="800901">Deputy Denham, who testified that he had with him a copy of the FBI interview report, the report I referred to earlier, read Minnick the statement of his Miranda rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.649" offset="845936">According to Deputy Denham, Minnick, after first referring to and answering questions about his escape from the Mississippi jail, then made certain inculpatory statements about his role in the homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.175" offset="895987">Those statements were introduced at trial and were referred to throughout the trial by the prosecutor in a case which wound up with a finding of capital murder and the death sentence being imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.415" offset="940918">Not at issue, then, in this case are the facts that Mr. Minnick not only asked for counsel, but asked for counsel to be present at any resumption of his interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.452" offset="985117">Not at issue is the fact that, notwithstanding that explicit request on his part, he was required to meet with the Mississippi sheriff without his counsel present, after his jailers told him that he had to talk with Denham and after they brought him down to see Denham.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.192" offset="1052095">There is no issue in this case, as has sometimes arisen before this Court, involving anything which conceivably be viewed as reinitiation by Minnick of discussions with the Mississippi sheriff.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.832" offset="1110609">He was brought down against his will to meet with him, after he had counsel, after he had asked for counsel to be present at any resumption of any... of any interrogation being resumed and questioned by the sheriff.</text>

            <text syncTime="341.916" offset="1494922">The core question in the case, then, is whether these allegedly inculpatory statements made by Minnick on the occasion of the reinterrogation he was required to attend can serve the basis... as a basis for his conviction and execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.834" offset="1558661">In our view, if the Court please, this case is governed by and indeed controlled by this Court's ruling in Edwards v. Arizona in its Fifth Amendment aspects, and in its Sixth Amendment aspects, its ruling of a similar nature in Michigan v. Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.075" offset="1619579">As we understand those cases, they conclude that the police, in a situation in which an individual States that he wishes to consult with counsel, must cease the interrogation at that time, and that it may not be resumed unless the defendant or the accused himself has reinitiated further communications with the authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.910" offset="1714978">In a sense the issue raised, as we view it, is even narrower than that, because in this case Mr. Minnick not only explicitly sought counsel, but explicitly requested counsel's presence at any resumption of the interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.540" offset="1773492">The basic issue that divides us here is then plain enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.312" offset="1792509">It is the position of both Mississippi and the United States, that since Minnick had access to counsel over the weekend, since he did speak to counsel over the weekend, that that suffices to meet the constitutional requirements of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.412" offset="1852904">We believe that as a reading of this Court's precedence, that it is a misreading, that Miranda itself determined that if an individual States he wants an attorney, interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.</text>

            <text syncTime="575.706" offset="2430106">If I may, the Court said in Edwards we now hold that when the accused has invoked his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation, a valid waiver of that right cannot be established by showing only that he responded to further police-initiated custodial interrogation, even if he has been advised of his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.111" offset="2511713">We further hold, and this is the sense of the question, that an accused, such as Edwards, having expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.462" offset="2581198">And then the Court says, as if, I would urge upon you, as if to clear up any potential ambiguity in the language,</text>

            <text syncTime="769.757" offset="3206361">One answer is that a lawyer would have told him they can't make you go down and talk to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.039" offset="3227468">They can't make you go down when you don't want to go down.</text>

            <text syncTime="790.791" offset="3290475">Sheriff Denham, who is going to talk to you about your mama back home, wants to execute you.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.563" offset="3309597">And the lawyer who is standing with him can play that sort of role.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.167" offset="3331958">And as a lawyer, he could explain to Minnick when questions were asked which Minnick, according to Sheriff Denham, answered, he could explain to Minnick that it might not be a defense for Mr. Minnick, even if the alleged confession was exactly what Minnick said, it might not be a defense for him if in fact the other individual accused and convicted of murder had killed one person and put a gun to Minnick's head and say you have to kill the other person or I'm going to kill you.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.417" offset="3461002">A lawyer present there would have played a role, and a lawyer in advance simply cannot play that role.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.633" offset="3489842">And our view is, Your Honor, then it not only makes a difference in this case, it makes a major difference in terms of what Edwards and Jackson and Roberson and a flock of precedence of this Court will be understood to have meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.633" offset="3549819">It would also lead, if this decision were to be affirmed, to a significant moving away from, at the least, what this Court has more than once referred to as the bright-line rule of Edwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.041" offset="3611468">Edwards is at the very least clear, comprehensible, understood by police.</text>

            <text syncTime="880.659" offset="3649920">If that is abandoned in this type situation, there simply is no doubt that we will wind up with Minnick hearings burdening the courts for years to come, and every prosecutor will... why would he not... want to reinterrogate an individual after he saw his lawyer, without the lawyers present.</text>

            <text syncTime="1592.132" offset="6495804">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.896" offset="6514926">Today the Court is being asked to determine the effect of counsel actually being furnished to a defendant on his subsequent waiver of his right to counsel in a renewed contact by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.484" offset="6561215">The State contends that Edwards v. Arizona allows a renewed contact by police after counsel has been made available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.400" offset="6596950">In fact, the concluding substantive paragraph in Edwards points out that the statement in question there was made without having had access to counsel, and therefore did not amount to a valid waiver, and hence was inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.098" offset="6647732">The same language is again used, or similar language is used again in Arizona v. Roberson, and the phrase there is without counsel having been provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.704" offset="6682109">And in Rhode Island v. Innis the Court said until had consulted with a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.818" offset="6706560">The cases use the terms, those terms... or that term... language from Edwards about having had access or having counsel been available over and over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.127" offset="6755775">The factual situation in this case at bar is distinguishable, of course, from the usual Edwards scenario, because here, after Minnick told the FBI agents that he didn't want to talk further until speaking with his lawyer, they ceased questioning and left him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.137" offset="6823902">And he told them to come back Monday and he would give a more detailed statement when his lawyer was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.612" offset="6841770">Some 2 days later, after he had consulted with his attorney by his own admission two or three times that weekend, not just a brief consultation, but he had met with counsel two or three times over the weekend, the Mississippi deputy sheriff arrived in San Diego and requested to be allowed to speak with Minnick.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.873" offset="6918779">Minnick was brought to the interview room and then--</text>

            <text syncTime="2368.633" offset="9601868">And of course the reason in Coleman v. Alabama, they say we look to the State law to see when those guarantees of the Sixth Amendment are impinged upon, then, you know, as in Coleman, there they say... you held that the preliminary hearing was the stage because if you fail to raise certain defenses at that point you would lose them forever, they would be forever waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.837" offset="9686609">So they said... found that to be the critical point where the right to counsel attached, and therefore the Sixth Amendment came into play there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2418.927" offset="9803011">And of course the Court there would have said well, the Sixth Amendment attached at the time that the crime was committed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2859.447" offset="11565127">So therefore the... as we said earlier, that the bright-line test would be that of that once counsel or consultation has occurred, then the police could reinitiate conversations with the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.319" offset="11644539">And then of course whether or not that waiver of rights... waive the right to counsel was in fact voluntary would be made under the totality of the circumstances test that we find in Michigan v. Mosley for that similar type situation, where the right to silence was invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.311" offset="11716532">The fact that a request has been honored counteracts, of course, the pressures of the custodial setting, and actual consultation with counsel removes I think to an even greater extent than just leaving the person alone and then coming back several hours after counsel had been... not been appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.497" offset="11813290">Briefly, on the Sixth Amendment issue, I think we've covered most of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.051" offset="11843487">But the fact that based on these two statutes the Mississippi Supreme Court has held that the right to counsel attaches at the time the arrest warrant issues, the fact that the legislature set an arbitrary time for the statute to begin running, and the Mississippi Supreme Court has turned it to a point for the attachment of a State law right to counsel should have no effect on when the Federal right attaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.321" offset="11948604">While it is true that we look to the State court law to make the determination as to when the Sixth Amendment right attaches, the examination of State law is to determine at what point rights guaranteed under the Sixth Amendment are implicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.717" offset="11998132">In Mississippi the court made clear the opinions leading to this, we consider, unusual holding, that it rejected the Federal approach and relied exclusively on State law in citing Page v. State and Cannaday v. State, which both clearly say they reject Federal law there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.967" offset="12067200">The, we would just submit that the issuance of an arrest warrant does not commit the State of Mississippi to prosecute a defendant, and therefore the Federal Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not attached in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.327" offset="12112653">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Floyd Abrams</label>
            <text syncTime="3001.430" offset="12133029">I would just like to make two points, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.370" offset="12140761">First, there was no ambiguity in what Mississippi said to its supreme court about the attachment issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.866" offset="12170749">I refer the Court to page JA 68 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.138" offset="12187886">We quote there from the brief of Mississippi to their supreme court in which they said, "It is", after dealing with the Fifth Amendment right having attached, citing Edwards, they then said</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.597" offset="12237727">"It is also evident that under Mississippi law, Minnick's Sixth Amendment right to counsel had attached at the time of the interview since warrants for his arrest had been issued. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.544" offset="12277433">citing Livingston v. State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.016" offset="12287360">That was the position of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.696" offset="12298122">If their position now were that they were wrong, or they made a mistake, or they are changing their view, I would be more sympathetic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.501" offset="12329260">It is perfectly clear, it is not a subject, it should not be a subject of debate that that is what they said to the Mississippi Supreme Court, nor that the Mississippi Supreme Court is fully aware of what its own constitutional provision is.</text>

            <text syncTime="3067.595" offset="12397701">Yes, they can change their mind, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.895" offset="12406896">But what they can't do is change retrospectively the mind of the Mississippi court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.447" offset="12425078">And it does that court no service here to say that they used shorthand when they talk about their own constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.203" offset="12456111">Justice Robertson in dissent, for example, in this case cited Article III Section 26 of the Mississippi constitution, which is their right to counsel section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.269" offset="12496340">The Mississippi Supreme Court referred to the Sixth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3097.194" offset="12516088">Excuse me, Mr. Abrams, that's really an accurate statement of the Mississippi Supreme Court's position, that under Mississippi law Minnick's Sixth Amendment right to counsel had attached at the time of the interview.</text>

            <text syncTime="3115.513" offset="12589336">Your decision, I believe Justice Scalia, is whether under... there is no doubt that it is for you to decide when Sixth Amendment rights attach, and that it is the Federal Constitution that makes that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.571" offset="12637610">I think it is State law, however, which is relevant in determining when Mississippi makes a "commitment to prosecute", or when... I am just about quoting from Kirby... "adversary proceedings have begun", as a matter of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.113" offset="12707722">Those are Mississippi decisions, I believe, not... they are procedural decisions, almost substantive decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.860" offset="12738756">But they are Mississippi ones.</text>

            <text syncTime="3158.513" offset="12761326">It happens if under Mississippi law... if it is an accurate statement to make to you that adversary proceedings have commenced as a matter of Mississippi law, or that Mississippi is, quote, committed, unquote, in the language of Kirby to proceed, then that is what I think that you should look to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.105" offset="12839693">And in looking to that, I think you should take very seriously indeed the ruling of the Mississippi court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.368" offset="12860800">The final observation I would make, I have decided not to make, except a quote from one line from Arizona v. Roberson, in which this Court said that new Miranda warnings will not reassure a suspect, who has been denied the counsel he has clearly requested, that his rights have remained untrammeled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.863" offset="12950766">The argument you have just heard is that what counsel, what Minnick asked for was given him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.457" offset="12973127">Hence he could relax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.207" offset="12980127">He asked for counsel to be present at the reinterrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.570" offset="12993607">That's what he asked for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.882" offset="12998831">That was not given to him.</text>
