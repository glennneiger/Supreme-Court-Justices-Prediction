            <label>Mr. Joel I. Klein</label>
            <text syncTime="12.629" offset="174271">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.642" offset="186287">Petitioners, The City of Columbia, South Carolina and COA, a private billboard company were found to have violated the antitrust laws by conspiring to restrain competition through the passage of two zoning ordinances.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.699" offset="242502">The principal question presented is whether such ordinances, even though they satisfy this Court's test in Town of Hallie, can nevertheless violate the antitrust laws if their enactment was motivated by the city's desire to benefit a private business rather than the public at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.913" offset="311361">We submit that they cannot for two related reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.414" offset="325363">First, municipal regulation that meets the Hallie test is deemed to be the sovereign action of the State and under Parker such action is exempt from the antitrust laws regardless of legislative motive and, second, under the Noerr-Pennington Doctrine, the Sherman Act likewise doesn't apply to a private party's successful effort to seek such an ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.988" offset="419717">If I may then begin with the judgment against the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.191" offset="432465">The scope of the Parker doctrine was set out... the scope of the State action exemption, excuse me, was set out in Parker where the court made plain that the Sherman Act doesn't cover a market restraint imposed by the State as sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.400" offset="481366">I want to emphasize that that's a generic exception based on the source of the restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.093" offset="504145">This Court has repeatedly made that very point, including recently in Hoover v. Ronwin, where it stated that quote</text>
            <text syncTime="102.149" offset="532357">"when a State legislature adopts legislation, its actions ipso facto are exempt from the antitrust laws. "</text>
            <text syncTime="109.153" offset="560360">Indeed in Ronwin itself, the court squarely rejected an exception to Parker based on the kind of claim at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.946" offset="587528">In that instance that a private bar association and a State supreme court had conspired to take action motivated by a desire to protect the economic interests of lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.215" offset="628592">Now if we agree that had South Carolina passed this statute, if would be exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.007" offset="655760">The question remaining is whether the city is entitled to a lesser measure of Parker protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.991" offset="679688">We think the answer to that question--</text>

            <text syncTime="176.547" offset="829944">And I think the answer is as you suggest, Justice White, that that's what Town of Hallie compels.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.670" offset="850424">Hallie says in a court of appeals felt... ruled that it was met here... Hallie says that once a municipal ordinance passes its test, it is in fact the sovereign action of the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="196.079" offset="908102">Once that's so, as Justice White has just suggested, that cities get the same measure of Parker protection as do the States and for each that measure of protection doesn't turn on the hows or the whys behind the particular ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.589" offset="974140">Now the court of appeals... correctly as you point out, Justice White... took the contrary view and it fashioned a rule, that is, it found an exception to Parker based on the notion that Congress wanted to strike down governmental action when taken for the wrong motives.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.941" offset="1047492">We simply don't think that's a plausible view for several reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="292.822" offset="1295028">Second, once you open up this kind of exception you're going to totally undermine the rationale of Parker itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.518" offset="1325853">In that case, of course, the Court explained that in the absence of a clear indication from Congress, it was not prepared, it would be inappropriate to conclude that the antitrust laws meant to restrict a State's sovereign prerogatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.037" offset="1383949">Yet that's precisely what an inquiry based on governmental motive would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.719" offset="1402653">Let's take, for example, the kind of zoning ordinance at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.292" offset="1416968">That ordinance obviously serves, such ordinances routinely serve a public purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="602.035" offset="2531874">--Well, Your Honor, I don't think the issue is here, but I think if the issue was here the answer is clear and let me, let me make, make that... what I mean by that paren.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.429" offset="2569490">That is this, this... the city didn't confer a franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.044" offset="2587880">This was an open market and COA had developed a significant, very significant market share.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.069" offset="2612018">Under South Carolina law expressly, cities are encouraged to zone, to zone billboards.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.833" offset="2643051">That is affirmatively encouraged.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.793" offset="2650888">Now I submit that that must... it must take into recognition that there will be anticompetitive effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.018" offset="2679831">It may not be a monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.300" offset="2684951">It could be an oligopoly or what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.531" offset="2693833">Second of all, South Carolina goes so far... and in this sense I think this is a stronger case than Hallie... it goes so far as to say with respect to Federal highways which the city has passed an ordinance, Federal-funded highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.739" offset="2746705">If a... which the State has an ordinance... if a city ordinance is stricter than the State's with respect to billboard zoning, the city ordinance trumps the State's.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.768" offset="2790800">So I think this is a clear case within Hallie.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.959" offset="2807622">Now let me also suggest if you start down this path... mind you we're now looking at the antitrust laws, and if you start down that path, courts are going to have to resolve a series of questions that go to the heart of the political process without any guidance from Congress whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.919" offset="2875436">For example, how should the courts identify the substantive standard for deciding what State action is protected by Parker and what isn't?</text>
            <text syncTime="696.497" offset="2909709">Now we've talked some about bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.367" offset="2917232">The Fourth Circuit seemed to think that favoritism toward a private constituent or perhaps some campaign contributions... that's a difficult area when it comes to Government relations... process.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.985" offset="2963730">How about causation?</text>
            <text syncTime="711.157" offset="2968328">How do we deal with causation in this kind of situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="714.199" offset="2980553">Must a majority of the legislators have been affected by the taint or just the margin by which it won?</text>
            <text syncTime="722.132" offset="3012318">And how about as to each individual legislator?</text>
            <text syncTime="724.884" offset="3023289">That is to say, does it have to be a sole motive, dominant motive, or some lesser standard acceptable?</text>
            <text syncTime="732.428" offset="3053487">We just think it's inconceivable that Congress wanted this Court and the lower courts to address all of those political concerns; and they're delicate ones under the antitrust laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="935.223" offset="3864641">Now if, if I, if I might then I, I think much of the discussion about whether there's a coconspiracy exception so to speak, it's two sides of the same coin so I think it applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.190" offset="3908527">But let me... it applies to COA as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.220" offset="3916677">But let me make two brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.662" offset="3922424">First of all, if the ordinances are valid under Parker, under Parker and Hallie, it follows automatically that COA, the private party, is protected under Noerr, and second, that COA's activities in any case are independently protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.433" offset="3997448">And respondent's belated suggestion frankly prompted some questions that this case involves bribery or extortion is just flatly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.539" offset="4033915">As to our first point, that is the Noerr point simpliciter, the question is whether Congress... did it intend the Sherman Act to police lobbying activities even when it has no intention to police the resulting governmental restraint?</text>
            <text syncTime="993.631" offset="4098280">That's what Parker immunity means.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.722" offset="4106640">That question was answered 30 years ago in Noerr where the court held flatly that the antitrust laws have no concern with the methods used to influence valid legislative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.607" offset="4150212">It's a view that the court has never deviated from since and was recently reaffirmed in Allied Tube a couple of years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.542" offset="4177902">Finally, and in all events, the judgment against the private petitioner, COA, must be reversed regardless of the city's protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.108" offset="4212174">The activities on which that judgment rests are constitutionally protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.502" offset="4229729">In this case, there is no allegation, no proof and no jury instruction to support a finding that COA bought these ordinances with a few relatively modest, properly disclosed campaign contributions made over a 6-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.320" offset="4293049">Without that kind of express finding, campaign contributions are fully protected under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.286" offset="4320844">They are, as Justice White said in United States v. Brewer, a routine and well-established part of our political process, often made with the expectation or hope that a legislature... legislator will champion a constituent's point of view.</text>

            <text syncTime="1080.849" offset="4447172">I disagree that this case has anything to do with lobbying, that this case is a case where there is far more than just the, as the Court has said in many cases, merely the solicitation or the asking of an ordinance to be passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.158" offset="4564409">Judge MacMahon in the very first order in this case said that the ordinances were but two of the overt acts of a conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.443" offset="4597533">And when we get into the facts of the case and you see all of the things that were done... you see, for example, on the part of COA, there was a lot of nonordinance activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.954" offset="4655524">They gave away space so Omni could not compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.848" offset="4679139">They made disparaging remarks about Omni.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.530" offset="4689902">They interfered with Omni's receipt of goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.222" offset="4700664">They got secret information from the city and used it against Omni.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.142" offset="4716338">They procured frivolous litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.995" offset="4727727">They stole or double-billed so as to give them an advantage and contrary to Mr. Klein, you'll find in footnote 4 of the Fourth Circuit opinion that there is indeed the exchange of billboards for favors in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2434.805" offset="9862982">Because what this case does, if you do anything but affirm it seems to me is you put the stamp of approval on a factual scenario that eliminates, that eliminates the process and closes it and turns it over to private individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.810" offset="9955038">Now that's what we have seen in the cases that we've tried not to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="2471.938" offset="10011462">And when you close that playing field, when you say that you can trade your power, trade your billboards, trade that to keep your monopoly and to keep them in power, then there is no process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.701" offset="10078545">It's not unlike many of the cases that you already talked about; Allied Tube, Motor Transport, and those type cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.617" offset="10122222">In closing, I'd like to make a couple of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.924" offset="10167466">And one of them everybody seems... well, Mr. Klein doesn't but when you read the writings and the cases... everybody seems to say that bribery should not be allowed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2524.034" offset="10219920">Bribery... we should not allow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.993" offset="10227756">That should and... subject the bribery people to antitrust liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.890" offset="10263283">Okay, did you ever... if you go behind bribery, look and see what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.822" offset="10283031">You have giving of money for favors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.925" offset="10291495">Okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.265" offset="10296824">What, what, what it has to do with that bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.997" offset="10307691">It isn't that the guy gets rich off of the money that's so offensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.371" offset="10325245">It's the fact that he has eliminated and sold his office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.714" offset="10346561">He has in effect... what we have here... he has closed the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.088" offset="10376132">So what bribery is and when you break it down, it's nothing more than paying money to close the process and I don't think anybody... at least from the writings that I've seen... wants to say that the antitrust, Noerr-Pennington, or the Parker should be okay even in the face of bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.325" offset="10477069">And if we look at that, if we look at the Affiliated Capital case from the Fifth Circuit where it was en banc with a lot of judges, you see a thorough discussion of this, these principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.075" offset="10544047">You see one in the Fourth Circuit and it comes down to, I think in this case, they're asking you to draw these lines.</text>
