            <text syncTime="2708.089" offset="10965395">Well, with all due respect, sir, I... there are two things that happened in the cases regarding search warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.815" offset="10992249">The first one is that police officers routinely ask for permission to search a place and don't narrow it as they are required to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.020" offset="11021088">Typically, however, the search warrant gives them permission to search everyplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.551" offset="11039164">Even though they may have known that the contraband was located, for example, in a bedroom, they will search and tear apart the entire house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.848" offset="11068422">So it's unreasonable, I suggest, sir, to assume that a citizen would understand that giving consent to search would be consent to do everything, to look in everyplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.435" offset="11114711">Narcotics knows no hiding places that are too small.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.597" offset="11127354">And I don't believe the citizen understands that consent is automatically a free for all for the officer to go anywhere he wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.220" offset="11157865">In addition, Justice Scalia, a search warrant commanding an officer to go in and to look for narcotics actually allows the tearing down of walls, in a car, the going into tires.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.949" offset="11200810">There are no limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.849" offset="11204363">So certainly, using your analogy, a citizen who says yes, you may look isn't consenting to have his home or car torn to smitherines because an officer feels narcotics might be hidden somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.166" offset="11249607">That's why I don't think we can draw the analogy between a compelled search and a consent search.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.880" offset="11276461">Totally different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.842" offset="11280327">The State of Florida has not demonstrated, we submit, the need, the desire, the helpfulness to law enforcement of allowing a general search to vitiate the Fourth Amendment when the consent is not asked for as a particular item.</text>
