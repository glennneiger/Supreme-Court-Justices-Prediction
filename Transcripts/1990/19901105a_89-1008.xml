            <text syncTime="119.311" offset="589322">In the facts of this case the debtor sought to exempt homestead property in Florida at the time of the filing of his bankruptcy petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.618" offset="642507">Under Florida law, however, the property was not immune by reason of the exemption to the attachment of a lien which they attached to the property prior to the time that the exemption was obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.184" offset="736757">Now each of the cases, each of the decisions below, the bankruptcy court, the district court, and the court of appeals concluded essentially that the lien was not avoidable because the property was not exempt in the sense that the lien, having attached prior to the time of the exemption right, rendered the property an exception to the homestead exemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="913.738" offset="3767066">I think the...

            <text syncTime="2010.934" offset="8155846">What Congress was concerned about here was several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.427" offset="8165773">First of all, it was concerned with the rule of Long against Bullard, this ancient Supreme Court case which said that even if there is an exemption, that as a matter of Federal law, apparently, that the lien is going to be preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.257" offset="8229093">And Congress, when it enacted 522, decided to adopt the rule of Long v. Bullard as a general matter, and you see that in 522(c), and to preserve most liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.637" offset="8282592">In particular it decided to preserve purchase money mortgages and liens, but to carve out an exception from the rule of Long against Bullard in the case of these judicial liens and nonpurchase money, nonpossessory liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.295" offset="8333270">And what it was doing in that respect was trying to serve State policy in those States that had opted out of the Federal exemptions to, where a State did not define the property in the limited way that Florida did here, it, Congress decided to assist State policy by voiding the lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.571" offset="8418324">And 522(f), of course, had other purposes also, because there is the alternative list of Federal bankruptcy exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.914" offset="8443715">522(f) operates with respect to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.887" offset="8455627">There are Federal nonbankruptcy exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.708" offset="8466912">It operates with respect to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.380" offset="8473599">And there are liens created by States outside of the debtor's domiciliary State, and 522(f) operates with respect to those also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.087" offset="8512365">So it's a meaningful provision in all of these respects, if you would opt our interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2277.527" offset="9222164">Now under State law, some of that property may come into bankruptcy subject to liens.</text>

            <text syncTime="2293.219" offset="9284963">That is not a situation in which a State has made a choice, such as Florida's, to preserve the lien.</text>

            <text syncTime="2329.402" offset="9429681">State law here is very clear that when there is a new exemption created, as there was here for single people, that it doesn't apply to preexisting liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.110" offset="9476493">So under Florida there's a rule against retroactivity of these exemptions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2358.411" offset="9545665">We have suggested... and under the Kener case, Justice Holmes' opinion in the Kener case, that Federal law should not be construed as requiring that State law operate retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.831" offset="9591431">And that is essentially for the same reasons as this Court articulated in Holt and Security Industrial Bank, and articulated most clearly in the Kener case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2491.799" offset="10079294">Well, there's another provision of the Bankruptcy Code, 506, which deals with this, if I understand your question correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.635" offset="10106566">And under 506(d), if the lien exceeds the value of the property at the time of the bankruptcy, that that excess amount of the lien is voided as a result of passing through bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.533" offset="10158184">So if we had a situation here where the property is worth $135,000 and the lien is $158,000, as a result of the bankruptcy proceeding the lien is reduced to $135,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="2553.022" offset="10324114">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.903" offset="10331637">The generosity or lack thereof the State chooses to give is up to the State, and the Bankruptcy Code leaves, leaves that as it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.271" offset="10373119">But the lien avoidance remedy is something that is Federally created.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.423" offset="10389733">If you... both the Senate and the House versions of the legislative history make it apparent that a lien was to avoided to the extent that an exemption could be enjoyed in the absence of the lien.</text>

            <text syncTime="2590.418" offset="10473743">If this, if this, if this debtor's property is executed on, he will be deprived of his exemption by a lone creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.533" offset="10518151">This will not serve to benefit the general administration of his estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.209" offset="10544901">It will not serve to benefit the larger share of his, of his creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.343" offset="10569456">This would not in, by any stretch of the imagination, pardon me... succeed in giving this debtor a fresh start.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.062" offset="10620342">This was a no asset case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.413" offset="10629746">His lone asset is the homestead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.743" offset="10639046">Florida law gives him the homestead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.807" offset="10655242">This lien is the only, the only thing that takes that exemption away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.790" offset="10683245">This lien is precisely within the definition of the terms and the conditions of 522(f)(1), and needs to be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.547" offset="10722220">If you permit State exceptions for lien encumbered property to defeat 522(f), then we will return to precode days where all liens passed through bankruptcy unavoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.932" offset="10799751">And the credi... and the debtor has no remedy, has no means of securing the exemption to himself following his discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.236" offset="10832979">That's the reason that I believe that, that if this Court takes an independent application of 522(f) upon whatever categories, quantities, or types of property that a State has included within its list of exemptions, and makes an independent application of the lien avoidance provision above and beyond the list selected by the State, then the lien must be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.704" offset="10994834">If it is not, then the exemption definitions created by the State will allow States to evade the lien avoidance concept or remedy altogether.</text>
