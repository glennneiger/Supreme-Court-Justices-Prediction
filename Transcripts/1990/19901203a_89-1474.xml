            <text syncTime="45.862" offset="319360">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="48.231" offset="328868">The case before you today involves a question of statutory interpretation; specifically who is entitled to sue for damages under the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.503" offset="361991">That section, which is also known as the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 provides a right of action to a seaman who is injured in the course of his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.275" offset="396996">The term seaman is not defined further in the body of the statute and it has been the subject of much debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.012" offset="423954">This case also provides an opportunity for the Court to reestablish and reaffirm a uniform national rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.250" offset="448927">The last definitive opinion reached by this Court was 33 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.718" offset="462824">And since that time there have been two divergent tracks which have been taken from that opinion even though it was clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.689" offset="486648">One group of circuit courts decides seaman status questions based on an analysis, at least in part, of the subject seaman's relationship to the transportation function or the navigation function of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.264" offset="532937">The Fifth Circuit in particular among the others does not take this into consideration, at least not in the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.067" offset="556238">This has led to an inconsistency of results throughout the country and needs to be addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.804" offset="575151">This case particularly draws that line for the Court, because in this case there is little question, and the Fifth Circuit so found, that Mr. Wilander, the seaman, the person claiming status under the act had no responsibilities relative to the vessel to which he claimed status which were related to its transportation or navigational function.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.666" offset="650592">It also presents a contrast for the Court because as a matter of first principle in this case, the district judge was forced to decide what was American law because the plaintiff's invocation of the Jones Act required it since he was injured in a foreign environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.276" offset="713077">He was injured on a platform in the Persian Gulf.</text>

            <text syncTime="217.774" offset="1007007">The last time definitively in Senko v. La Crosse Dredging which reemphasized the aid to navigation requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.429" offset="1037622">And I believe, Justice O'Connor, following up with your question, it must be at all times considered when reviewing the Jones Act that it is an employment-based statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1004.350" offset="4153299">You started off with a criterion that the seaman must be somehow engaged as an aid to the navigational function of the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.158" offset="4192587">Then Justice O'Connor raised the question, what about the bartender and the dance instructor?</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.693" offset="4210664">And you said, well, they qualify because they're not steering or doing anything like that, but it's the object of the ship's passage through the water to engage in recreational activities which they are aiding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.172" offset="4280568">Then we got to the question of the harpooner or the seal harpooner and the problem that you had with including the seal harpooner was that the ship was not moving at the time he harpooned and that the harpooning was not, as I understand it, an act in furtherance of the... of maritime commerce and I think the trouble, at least that I'm having, is understanding what you mean by maritime commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.258" offset="4400940">In the case of the bartender and the dance instructor, the ship is at least part of the time moving around because that's the way it makes its money, by carrying people, and the reason they want to be carried in the ship includes the fact that they would like to avail themselves of dancing and the drinking that goes on the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.723" offset="4494772">In the case of... that we have before us, the boat in question has got to move through the water or the petitioner here, the respondent here doesn't get to the platform, and it's certainly doing it for a commercial purpose because that's why they're paying people to move the ship is to get him there so he can do the painting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.905" offset="4583588">Why is there not a connection to maritime commerce in the latter case, but there is a connection to maritime commerce for the bartender?</text>

            <text syncTime="1279.063" offset="5252218">That's the same thing that this Court had; a procurium opinion, Gianfala v. Texas Company; reversed a Fifth Circuit opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1295.424" offset="5317629">It was a semisubmersible rig and his job included a responsibility that he move it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.662" offset="5338527">So this Court has never moved off the requirement that a person aid in the navigation of a vessel before he is considered to be a member of its crew.</text>

            <text syncTime="2065.373" offset="8397466">As Judge Robison noted in... as Judge Wisdom noted in the Robison opinion, the aid to navigation requirement has been watered down so much that it's really lost its meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.331" offset="8445218">I think that the mission concept is much more useful and encompasses the changing needs of the maritime industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.737" offset="8498925">We would also refer the Court to the Oceanographic Research Vessels Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.475" offset="8517838">Vessels engaged in oceanography, like the paint boat Gates Tide, carry two crews; one a navigational crew and another crew of scientific personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.915" offset="8555559">By means of the statute, Congress excluded these scientists from seaman status under the Jones Act if the ship owner obtained certification from the Coast Guard if the vessel is engaged in oceanography.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.123" offset="8604460">Now, obviously this statute would never have been necessary except that Congress recognized these scientists would normally be classified as seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.680" offset="8642599">I feel that the fourth and clearest indicia of congressional intent came in 1970 and 1971 when Senator John Tower of Texas introduced legislation to extend the benefits of the Longshoreman Act to workers employed offshore in marine extractive operations, which the bill defined as basically anything to do with mineral production over navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.046" offset="8736117">The bill would have made such compensation the sole and exclusive remedy; no more Jones Act, no more General Maritime Law, no more Death on the High Seas Act and it would have amended the Longshoremans Act to remove the exclusion from member of a crew of a vessel unless that person was engaged solely under the Manning Requirements set forth by the United States Coast Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.875" offset="8823471">So this bill would have in effect have codified the application of the Seventh Circuit rule in areas where mineral production takes place over navigable waters.</text>

            <text syncTime="2485.143" offset="10076512">Herb's Welding stands for the proposition that oil drilling is not traditional maritime activity when it is done on land, since by prior decision of this Court, the Court was required to treat the fixed platform as equivalent to an artificial island.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.253" offset="10136907">But in this case, the oil drilling and the services related... they, too, were done from a vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.657" offset="10162507">The restrictive interpretation of maritime activity espoused by the petitioner was repudiated by this Court very recently in the case of Sisson v.
