            <text syncTime="25.297" offset="223550">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="29.870" offset="241836">This case involves the interplay between two lines of Federal criminal statutes enacted over the past 6 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.487" offset="272347">One line involves sentencing reform; the other group of laws reflects the desire of Congress to toughen drug penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.963" offset="302231">The judgment below required imposition of a term of supervised release for an offense committed before November 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.979" offset="338280">Only by reversing that judgment can all of the statutes involved here, which were certainly meant to work together, be reconciled.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.726" offset="377255">In 1984, after lengthy and thorough deliberation, Congress enacted an scheme of Federal sentencing reform, a comprehensive scheme that included the abolition of parole, and also to be abolished was that special form of extended parole applicable only to certain controlled substances cases called special parole, which was... in 1984, the Sentencing Reform Act instead created a new kind of post-incarceration supervision, to be called supervised release, which was carefully defined and circumscribed in detailed provisions of that 1984 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.296" offset="539527">Congress realized at that time that to prepare the Federal criminal justice system to make the change to this entirely new sentencing system would take time, and that 1984 statute thus initially set a start-up period of 2 years, in fact over 2 years, for the new system before it would become effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.598" offset="612775">Congress soon realized that it would... that 2 years would not be long enough and extended that period for another year, with the resulting effective date for supervised release and all other new aspects of the sentencing system of November 1, 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.990" offset="678290">Meanwhile, on October 27th, 1986, the President signed into law the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, which made a number of changes in Federal drug sentencing, especially in the higher-volume offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.410" offset="740043">This 1986 statute used the term, supervised release, without giving any definition for that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.925" offset="770032">In some of its provisions, including section 1002 of that statute which is the statute involved in this case under which my client was sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.744" offset="813291">Petitioner here was convicted for some of these higher-volume heroin offenses involving conduct with occurred in February 1987, which was of course after enactment of that '86 drug act on October 27th of '86 but before the effective date of the Sentencing Reform Act on November 1, '87.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.295" offset="891553">Under the law... one more piece of background that's needed... under the law as existed from 1984 until the effective date of supervised release under the '86 Anti-Drug Act, persons convicted of the same offenses as the petitioner here would have been subject to ordinary parole but no other supplemental post-confinement supervision or monitoring.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.031" offset="986430">For example, in this case, the petitioner has an aggregate sentence of 20 years, of which he is likely to serve about 10 in prison and then to serve the remaining 10 years on parole, ordinary pre-sentencing reform act parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.733" offset="1061245">If supervised release applies, this would be in addition to the petitioner's ordinary parole.</text>

            <text syncTime="269.245" offset="1199380">--In one sense, Justice Kennedy, that's true, but in another it's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.199" offset="1211188">And that's because Congress provided in the effective date provisions of the '84 act which govern and control and include the supervised-release implementation and definitional provisions that not only would it have an effective date of November 1, 1987, but also that it should not apply to any offense committed before that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.883" offset="1293839">I think the language of the statute is shall only apply to offenses committed after the taking effect of the statute, so that section 35.83, which is the supervised release provision of the Sentencing Reform Act by its... by the terms of its own effective date provision, can never apply to my client's case or to the other people who committed offenses between October '86 and November 1, '87.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.980" offset="1386313">That was Congress' specific declaration on that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.153" offset="1402926">So the suggestion that the case is not significant because, after all, by the time he finishes serving the 10 year imprisonment portion of his sentence we'll have a system in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.832" offset="1449633">It's true there will be a... system in place, but it won't be a system that applies to him by law.</text>

            <text syncTime="336.226" offset="1467292">Well, it, it goes to the point of what Congress probably intended, and if you're saying that we can't know what supervised release means because it's an empty term without implementing provisions, there are couple answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.947" offset="1538136">One is that the implementing provisions are on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.881" offset="1549839">They're not enforced yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.313" offset="1559557">The other is that the implementing provisions won't be needed so far as effecting the supervised release until they are fully effective.</text>

            <text syncTime="371.852" offset="1609712">Well, not only are they not applicable, and of course when we look for congressional intent, the first thing to look at is the language that specifically addresses the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.019" offset="1642417">The language which addresses that question is language which says that those implementing provisions do not apply to an offense committed at the time my client committed his offenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="500.631" offset="2124846">First, that to put 1002 and especially its supervised-release provisions into effect immediately, is to create a set of some half-dozen inconsistencies, contradictions, and complete nullifications of related provisions of the statute that are not there if you... treat the statute as effective on November 1, '87.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.779" offset="2217424">The second areas of analysis that overcomes the, the presumptive axiom is the in pari materia approach, which says that we have to view the supervised-release phrase, otherwise underfined in 1002, in relation to all the other provisions dealing with supervised release, and all of them go into effect November 1, 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.973" offset="2302270">And, third, finally, the rule of lenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.955" offset="2314182">If this is a question worth talking about, if it's a question intelligent people could answer in two ways and we can't come up with a clear, settled right answer, it's a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.742" offset="2353366">So that whatever power that axiom has in civil cases perhaps to act as a trump doesn't exist in criminal cases because of the rule of lenity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1812.869" offset="7373787">First of all, the thesis that the whole of section 1002 was delayed for a year is a non-starter, because in the penalty provisions in 1986 Congress stipulated that there would be no parole under these penalty provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.201" offset="7447139">They were mandatory prison terms, and there simply would be no reason for Congress to state that there's no parole if the effective was November 1st, 1987, because as of November 1st, 1987, parole was abolished.</text>

            <text syncTime="1956.299" offset="7947540">Well, the other reason why we think that the way to solve whatever anomalies there are is not to delay supervised release is that Congress clearly passed a provision that had mandatory monitoring in it, and we have to go a little bit into the history of this enactment in order to understand why that's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.776" offset="8045447">Every... the petitioner and we both agree that up until the penultimate moment when the 1986 act was passed, the statute provided for mandatory monitoring in the form of special parole for all of the drug categories that apply to petitioner's offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.458" offset="8116187">So it was crystal clear that Congress wanted these individuals to get a mandatory term of monitoring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.894" offset="8145966">The statute also provided that on November 1st, 1987 there was going to be a word substitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.029" offset="8174492">Every place that special parole appeared in the statute, supervised released would now appear and so people committing offenses after November 1st, 1987, would get supervised release.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.848" offset="8217751">But it... but in no way did that draft statute, the penultimate statute, create a gap whereby there would be a period that individuals committing these drug offenses would get nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.077" offset="8266652">On the eve of enactment for reasons that we will never know, a substitution was made, a single-word substitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.772" offset="8305418">Every place that the term special parole appeared in the act, the word supervised released... it was crossed out and the word supervised release replaced it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.047" offset="8342512">The effect of that word substitution was simply to roll back 1 year the seamless transition from one kind of monitoring to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.136" offset="8382845">The effect... it is... it's simply perverse to say that what Congress was doing when it substituted those words was opening up a year gap and sending the message that it wanted to delay the effective date of this statute either in whole or in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.379" offset="8455883">This is especially true as Justice Scalia pointed out because Congress knew how to delay the effective date of parts of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.303" offset="8491514">It did it in section 1004, 1006, 1007, and 1009 and for Congress to choose this coy, roundabout, ambiguous method to accomplish the same thing, it's just not a plausible account of what happened when Congress passed this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.657" offset="8561000">What happened is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.018" offset="8570404">Someone decided that there was no reason to perpetuate what was soon to be an outmoded form of monitoring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.643" offset="8604886">They might as well initiate supervised release a year early.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.237" offset="8623276">But Congress forgot to make the little... the collateral changes that would have created a completely harmonious statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.221" offset="8655250">But the fact that Congress forgot to do a few little things over here doesn't mean that what they did in the core penalty provisions, what they did at the center, wasn't intentional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2175.609" offset="8824837">Now, we point out in our brief that if the penultimate change had never been made and the statute was passed saying special parole instead of supervised release in all the places where the replacement was made, this would be a completely internally consistent and coherent statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.602" offset="8900801">So the question arises, you know, why not just rewrite the statute and put special parole back where supervised release is, which by the way is very different from saying that the effective date of the whole or part of the statute is delayed, which has very different consequences in particular that petitioner won't get any monitoring.</text>

            <text syncTime="2478.371" offset="10035873">So it will be at least 10 years before he'll actually be out and be supervised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.988" offset="10066280">My final... the point... one more point I want to make about this question of delaying the supervised release penalty, which of course would mean that petitioner would get nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.039" offset="10130541">It's important to note that the conflict in the courts below has not really been about whether individuals who are... to commit their offenses during this period get nothing or get supervised release.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.847" offset="10193757">Almost virtually every court that's wrestled with this problem has ruled that... or the result of every decision has been that these offenders get something, either supervised release or special parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.639" offset="10252899">But petitioner is asking to be let... to get nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.781" offset="10269513">And although the courts below have come out in different ways and they've said different things and some have concluded that the '86 act is delayed and some have concluded that they're not, there's virtually unanimous agreement that it simply would not comport with what Congress did when it passed this act and what Congress intended to open up, to create this opening for individuals committing these offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.510" offset="10380376">The second point about delaying supervised release is that it really can't be squared with the text and structure of the 841 penalty revisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.758" offset="10429382">If you actually look at section 1002 and the changes that it made to section 841 to the penalties, you'll see that the terms of imprisonment, the fines, and the post-confinement monitoring supervised-release requirements are all put together in one paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.313" offset="10507645">They're part of the same... they're part of an organic whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.395" offset="10531886">They're meant to function together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.948" offset="10542126">What petitioner is saying is that we're going to apply these statutes piecemeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.753" offset="10561353">We're going to use the mandatory prison sentence from the 1986 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.026" offset="10582460">We're going to go back I suppose to the 1984 act and use whatever post-confinement monitoring requirement there is in the 1984 act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.002" offset="10618404">We're going to slap together this patchwork which creates its own set of anomalies and contradictions, especially for cocaine offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.539" offset="10656543">And in fact if you sit down and look at how it works to use part of the '84 act and part of '86 act you come up with blatant contradictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.615" offset="10696771">And that's apparent if you look at the cocaine offenses which... the result of slapping together these two acts would be that more serious cocaine offenses would get a less harsh sentence than less serious cocaine offenses, and I won't bore the Court with the details of explaining that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.739" offset="10777333">But that is the result of this patchwork solution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2773.977" offset="11218280">So the anomaly that the Government offers really doesn't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.590" offset="11240745">In fact it cuts in our favor by showing the rationality of... or... let's... the lack of irrationality I think is more fair, yes, of saying that Congress was willing to tolerate a year's delay in the reinstitution of extra supervision for this small category of offenders to avoid upsetting a very complicated transition to a whole new sentencing system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.850" offset="11361744">It's true that there's never been a case in this Court resolving a controversy about an effective date by finding that it was delayed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2825.212" offset="11423184">And it's certainly not true that the courts of appeals have never found a delayed effective date.</text>
