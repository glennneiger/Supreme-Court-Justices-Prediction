            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="9.881" offset="113462">This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals of California First Appellate District.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.606" offset="140316">Late one evening, two police officers were cruising in a high crime area of Oakland, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.295" offset="163095">As they turned the corner, they noticed a group of youth huddled around a car.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.156" offset="182530">When the youth saw the officers’ car approaching, they fled as did the car around which they had been congregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.011" offset="209906">Some of them ran further down the same street pursued by one of the officers in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.086" offset="230282">Two of them including respondent, Hodari D. run into an alley which lead over to the next street.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.448" offset="259748">The second officer, having left the car, run back up to the top of the street over the next street where the alley came out and back down towards the alley.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.282" offset="295065">He found himself running directly at Hodari who did not see him at first because Hodari was looking behind as he ran.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.772" offset="324949">About 11 feet from the officer, Hodari turned and saw the officer and at that point threw away some drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.893" offset="357446">The officer then tackled Hodari and the drugs were retrieved by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.816" offset="377194">In a juvenile proceeding brought against Hodari, the court refused to suppress evidence of the abandoned drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.392" offset="407496">The California Court of Appeal reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.332" offset="419199">In that court’s view, Hodari was seized for purposes of the Fourth Amendment when he was chased and the seizure was unreasonable because the officer did not have a reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct that would justify a stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.347" offset="471340">The California Supreme Court refused review and we granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.717" offset="488789">In an opinion filed today, we reverse the judgment of the California Court of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.925" offset="509583">We assume for purposes of this case that the officer who chased Hodari had no reasonable suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.780" offset="532989">The only question before us is when, for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, Hodari was actually seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.581" offset="560261">If he was seized before he disposed of the drugs, the police’s obtaining of the drugs could be viewed as the product of the unlawful seizure in which case the drugs were excludable at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.327" offset="599235">If he was seized after he disposed of the drugs, they were unquestionably admissible in so far as federal law is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.066" offset="626194">As used in the Fourth Amendment, a seizure when applied to seizure of the person referred to an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.354" offset="651376">At common law, an arrest could be affected in only two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.485" offset="667885">Either by physically grasping the person, the slightest touching would suffice, or by the person’s voluntary submission to a show of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.127" offset="702471">Here, there was neither.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.542" offset="708114">The officer made no physical contact with Hodari until after he had dropped the drugs, and Hodari had not yielded to any show of authority but was in full flight.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.845" offset="745312">He had not been arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.408" offset="751581">He had not been seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.231" offset="758791">The police’s possession of the drugs was therefore not the product of an unlawful seizure and they could, consistently with federal law, be admitted in the juvenile proceeding below.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.873" offset="793377">Accordingly, the judgment of the California Court of Appeal is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.089" offset="810305">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Marshall joins.</text>
