            <label>Mr. Richard Thompson</label>
            <text syncTime="2888.789" offset="11681741">Not as tough, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.860" offset="11686025">Not... we have, and I will admit we have the toughest penalties, but this Court has said that merely because a State has the toughest penalty in any area does not mean it is grossly disproportionate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.797" offset="11733776">Because under our Federal system there will always be a State that has the distinction of having the severest penalty in some offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.452" offset="11764392">That's the beauty of the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.814" offset="11773796">That people can look to the State of Michigan and see what Michigan's experience is with the drug laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.557" offset="11796784">And as the Solicitor General has said in his brief, that States are starting to follow Michigan's lead, that they are making stricter penalties in the drug area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.214" offset="11835445">That in fact the Federal Government in the last 10 years has amended its controlled substance act 3 times, and each time it has made the penalties tougher.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.312" offset="11875778">Now, petitioner doesn't say it's unconstitutional to create a crime such as we have created, and petitioner admits that this crime is a grave one, admits it in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.452" offset="11928336">The only question that petitioner has is has the State-mandated law gone so high as to make it constitutionally impermissible?</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.239" offset="11967520">Now, what that issue does is thrust this Court into the line-drawing process which this Court has said on many occasions is preeminently... belongs to the legislative branch of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.965" offset="12018407">There's no question about it, Your Honor, that the decision, Your Honors, that the decision in this case will affect the extent to which the State legislatures and the Federal Government can enact tough laws to deal with this grave crisis that our Nation is facing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.038" offset="12090714">And I respectfully request that this Court send a clear signal that under the war on drugs that tough penalties, such as Michigan's, are constitutionally permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.186" offset="12139301">If you have no further questions, thank you, Your Honor.</text>
