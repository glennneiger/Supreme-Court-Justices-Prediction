            <text syncTime="58.937" offset="356361">The Supreme Court of Texas declared that the State of Texas, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="63.241" offset="373497">"has an interest in protecting employees' interests in pension plans. "</text>
            <text syncTime="67.109" offset="389066">and held that a terminated employee can recover under the common law of Texas whenever he proves that the principal reason for his termination was the employer's desire to avoid contributing to or paying benefits under the employee's pension fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.785" offset="451760">It was a 5 to 4 decision in which the dissenters pointed out that this new common law cause of action under Texas law was preempted by ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.676" offset="491257">Of course, the question of whether a Federal statute preempts a State law is a question of the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.747" offset="519574">Petitioner submits that the intent of the 93d Congress in passing ERISA is perfectly clear in every respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.936" offset="552279">In the language of ERISA where the express preemption provision preempts any State law that relates to an employee benefit plan, and this law clearly relates to pension plans; from the structure of ERISA, because Congress inserted in ERISA itself a provision which is numbered 510 of ERISA which does essentially the same thing as the Texas law common law cause of action, and which demonstrates that Congress thought that protection against purposeful interference with rights under a plan was not remote, peripheral, or tangential but was central to the business of regulating employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.978" offset="708492">Next, from the enforcement provisions of ERISA which this Court has held are comprehensive, interrelated and exclusive, and those are the means for enforcing section 510 of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.286" offset="757706">Next, from the legislative history of ERISA, which demonstrates clearly as this Court has previously held in the Shaw case that Congress intended to preempt at a minimum all State laws treating the same subjects as ERISA, and the Texas law clearly treats the same subject as ERISA section 510 does; and finally, from the purposes of ERISA preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.068" offset="852896">The purpose of every provision of ERISA is to promote and protect employees' interests in pension plans.</text>

            <text syncTime="1512.677" offset="6171323">102 years ago, the Texas supreme court came down with the Eastline decision which held unequivocally, without exception, any employer could terminate any employee for no reason at all... the employment-at-will doctrine, or sometimes referred to as the fire-at-will doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.527" offset="6258676">Over the last century, the Texas court has changed and developed that law to take its harsh remedies and look at those harsh remedies in light of the realities of today's environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.702" offset="6319385">The Texas supreme court has imposed some restrictions on that harsh employment-at-will doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.956" offset="6348433">They have imposed that if the parties contract an employment, a for cause provision will be inferred in all the contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.129" offset="6385109">Very recently, the Texas supreme court, based on the public policy of the State, said, if an employee is fired for refusing to commit a crime, well, we can't let the employment-at-will doctrine prevent a cause of action because our State public policy warrants, it mandates, that we can't let that wrong go without redress, and the court carved out another exception to the employment-at-will doctrine and said, if you can prove that the reason this employee was terminated was because he failed to commit a crime, he will have, or she will have, a State cause of action for wrongful termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.456" offset="6550412">In this case, the McClendon case, the court again looked at the realities of today's employment setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.062" offset="6580818">Pension benefits, welfare benefits, and health plans are... are so much more an essential element of our employment packages today than they were in 1988, and the court said, we have a public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.338" offset="6641945">We have an interest in protecting our employees, our men and women, with respect to their pension benefits, and therefore, because of our public policy, if you prove that a man or a woman is fired for the principal reason of the employer trying to avoid pension obligations, then that person has a State cause of action.</text>

            <label>Mr. Hollis T. Hurd</label>
            <text syncTime="2605.234" offset="10541504">I think it's important to understand that, throughout ERISA, Congress was making a delicate balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.923" offset="10576299">When you talk about promoting and preserving employees' interests in plans, there are two elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.911" offset="10600227">One is promoting the employees' rights, but the other part of it is promoting the maintenance and establishment of plans themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.314" offset="10629798">Section 510 enforced, through the remedies of section 502, are the enforcement mechanism and the remedies that Congress decided were appropriate and struck the right balance between the employee's interest in recovering damages and their desire not to discourage the establishment and maintenance of plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.061" offset="10712867">To... to take Justice Scalia's question, it's... you can imagine a grocery store with 20 employees in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.632" offset="10739094">Suppose there's high turnover within the first 2 years, but very little turnover of employees after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.452" offset="10762395">It would make sense for the employer in that case to establish a pension plan with 2-year cliff vesting, so that no one was vested before 2 years, everyone was fully vested after 2 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.343" offset="10805968">But the first time a jury verdict comes down from the State court in Texas with punitive damages in it, the employer's going to think very seriously about whether he should alter the vesting schedule and make it the maximum permitted by law... 5-year cliff vesting, so as to diminish the credibility of the claims of people who might sue who were let go in the first 2 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.423" offset="10886320">This, of course, would work to the disadvantage of the other participants in the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.209" offset="10905442">Another thing the employer might do in that situation is install full and immediate vesting, so that everyone is vested on the day they walk in, so that once again, there's no risk of an employee who is terminated claiming the termination was for the purpose of interfering with his vesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.503" offset="10966568">But once again, that would result in giving pensions to people who only worked there for a month, and would diminish, overall, the pool of pension money available to those who really do stay with the employer until retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.959" offset="11012439">Congress decided that the balance that they struck in sections 510 and 502 of ERISA was the appropriate balance, so that employees had protections without going so far as to discourage the establishment and maintenance of plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.702" offset="11067401">In this way, section 510 clearly does relate to plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.440" offset="11094359">Congress understood that there's really a triangular relationship at work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.093" offset="11112959">You have the plan, the employer, and the employee, and all three sides of that triangle relate to the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.347" offset="11142007">The employee versus the plan is vesting claim procedures, and so forth, the employer vis-a-vis the plan is the funding requirements, for example, but equally important is the employer versus the employee, whenever the employer acts for the purpose of interfering with the rights under the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.292" offset="11209716">In that case, that aspect of the employment relationship is where it overlaps with the field of employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.248" offset="11245556">When the Congress occupied the field of employee benefit plans, it did occupy that portion of the employment relationship precisely because it does relate to employee benefit plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.372" offset="11290069">Back on the subject of force or the threat of force, let me just note that the following section of ERISA, section 511, makes it unlawful to employ force, fraud, or the threat of force in order to interfere with someone's right to benefits under a plan.</text>
