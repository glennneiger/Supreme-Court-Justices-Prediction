            <label>Mr. J. Mark Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="10.168" offset="172460">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.134" offset="204329">The principle to be applied in this case is that jurisdiction under a Section 1 of the Sherman Act requires an allegation and if controverted proof that the restraint alleged to have been imposed by the defendants has as a matter of practical economics a not insubstantial effect on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.189" offset="276531">Accordingly it is not sufficient to allege for jurisdictional purposes as Dr. Pinhas has only that either the plaintiff or the defendants are engaged in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.559" offset="321984">Petitioners believe this principle stems from the plain language of the act, the purposes for which it was enacted, the case interpreting the act including the claim, and the extent of congressional power under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.835" offset="375065">We start by looking at the plain language of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.272" offset="388858">Section 1 prohibits those conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.800" offset="411010">The purpose of that language at the time it was enacted was to allow the Federal Government to supplement the acts of states in regulating anti-competitive activities which individual states could not, namely anti-competitive activities which went beyond the state and went from state to state.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.059" offset="479973">As this Court held in its early decision Apex Hoisery, the addition of the words were commerce among the states was the means to relate the prohibited restraint of trade to interstate commerce for constitutional purposes so Congress could penalize restraints involving or affecting interstate commerce which it perceived as the reach of its power under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.973" offset="567640">As this Court went on to note in the Frankfort Distilleries case, this results in an obvious distinction between a course of conduct wholly within a state often referred to a purely local and conduct which although local in an inseparable element of a larger program which depends for its success upon activity which affects commerce among the several states.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.651" offset="654366">The import of the precise language of Section 1 has been highlighted in a number of decisions by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.601" offset="682161">Most notably in Gulf Oil Corporation v. Copp Paving, a case which the Court relied upon in its subsequent decision in McLain.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.412" offset="709433">In that case, the Court drew a distinction between the language of Section 1 of the Sherman Act and the language of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.892" offset="739317">It held that the words, restrain of trade or commerce among the states, meant that the jurisdictional reach of Section 1 was keyed directly to effect on interstate markets and the interstate flow of goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.419" offset="789472">And the import in that case was Justice Marshall's concurrence in Gulf Oil where he noted that the phrase, among the several states, embraces all commerce save or except that which is confined to a single state as it does not affect other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.069" offset="847986">In so holding the Court went on to state that as a result of its provisions, a jurisdictional inquiry under the Sherman Act was to be a particular one focusing on the facts and circumstances presented in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.799" offset="898977">The reason for that particularized determination was the need to identify a specific restraint because Congress was regulating restraints which were among the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.122" offset="940251">That need would not exist if all that was required was to point to something that was called a line of commerce or a class of activities to create jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.681" offset="974523">It would be as if this Court simply read out of the act the words or... among the states and commerce among the states and simply said that this was an act to prohibit restraints of trade period.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.989" offset="1023738">That is not what the act says and its plain language requires more.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.160" offset="1040352">It is the language of Section 1 which also distinguishes its reach from other cases where Congress itself, other statutes where this Court has considered, that Congress itself has defined the specific persons and activities that affect Congress and therefore, their effect... excuse me... they affect commerce and therefore require Federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.261" offset="1120809">If we look at cases such as Perez v. United States, Russell v. United States, even Heart of Atlanta, Wickard against Filburn, those are all cases where Congress has engaged in specific fact finding to find that the cumulative effect of some particular evil has an effect on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.128" offset="1200221">A general statute such as the Sherman Act has not been accompanied by specific congressional findings to the effect that a class of activities in particular has an effect on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.031" offset="1247869">And that's why under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, it is required to engage in a case by case review of particular allegations and particular complaints to see whether in fact there is a restraint which significantly, substantially, and adversely affects interstate commerce.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Mark Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="325.309" offset="1433024">I think the way I read McLain is that the Court looked at a situation which involved a brokerage for four years in New Orleans and looked at an alleged conspiracy to fix commission rates which are part of the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.648" offset="1482344">And the price would affect the volume of sales and the Court engaged in some detailed fact finding actually based on a real record to say that that volume of sales affected interstate commerce as a result of financing from out of state or title insurance that came from out of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.798" offset="1546918">So I think factually one can distinguish McLain on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.515" offset="1565831">Admittedly there is language in McLain which we find to be ambiguous, for example, and does talk about general activities in the brokerage business or the general activities of one of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.931" offset="1611493">However, I don't believe that that is the actual test that McLain established.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.946" offset="1631555">Indeed, Chief Justice Burger at the time specifically towards the end of the opinion restates the Federal jurisdictional requirement that there be as a matter practical economics a not insubstantial effect on interstate commerce by the restraint that has been allegedly imposed by the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.579" offset="1702086">So in the case McLain the restrain that was allegedly imposed by the defendant was a conspiracy to fix an inseparable part of the price of real estate and that price fixing activity would affect as the Court found by looking at the actual facts in question that title insurance coming in from out of state in very significant volumes of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.008" offset="1787767">This was a case that involved real estate brokers throughout New Orleans over a period of 4 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.068" offset="1812009">I think it's also note worthy in looking at the McLain decision itself, several things to indicate that McLain did not attempt to set a new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.188" offset="1852551">I think some commentators have suggested that it did set a new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.937" offset="1867493">First of all, the cases relied upon by McLain are for example Gulf Oil, Goldfarb, Trustees of Rex, were clearly no nude rule was at work in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.573" offset="1906050">In addition, the Chief Justice at that time judge... joined Justice O'Connor's concurrence in Jefferson Peers v. Hyde which in footnote 5 specifically says that there's got to be an effect on commerce for there to be Section 1 jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.382" offset="1961325">In addition, I think that the practice this Court has engaged in over time is to stand by a settled authority which would say that you leave statutory interpretations with respect to jurisdictional scope in place and leave the task of modifying that scope to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.452" offset="2029557">There's no indication in the decision in McLain that this Court was attempting, if you will, to supplant Congress and in Petitioner's view amend the statute to read out the words, among the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.042" offset="2075950">So I would distinguish McLain first by saying that I think it is distinguishable from the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.570" offset="2102073">Second, I think the plain reading of McLain and the activity that was actually engaged in by the Court shows that the Court simply didn't identify real estate brokerage activities as an activity and say, we need go no further.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.613" offset="2154213">The Court I think went through great pains to say the activity we're focusing on is price fixing and how does price fixing affect real estate transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.655" offset="2194337">So I don't believe McLain stands for a position contrary to that which is being urged by the Petitioners in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="530.024" offset="2251806">I'm not sure I understand the import of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.007" offset="2267793">What was the focus of that case was price fixing in commissions by all the brokers in New Orleans for a period of 4 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.583" offset="2298095">So they focused on that particular transaction and found, in at least my reading of the case, found that that was part of setting the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.658" offset="2326412">So if the brokers commission is part of the price and if you're going to affect the price, you're obviously going to affect the volume of sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.873" offset="2351281">And the Court felt... inclined even to go beyond that and say, well, what difference did it make?</text>
            <text syncTime="560.091" offset="2372074">The difference it made were hundreds of millions of dollars of out-of-state financing, title insurance, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.383" offset="2397256">So it obviously went farther than that to reach the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.540" offset="2409900">As I mentioned I think that McLain also is consistent with the cases that preceded it and the 2 cases of great import that preceded were Goldfarb and Trustees of Rex Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.303" offset="2457024">Now in Goldfarb the Court went to great lengths to examine the particular transactions in question, that was the legal services involved in that case, to find that those specific legal services were coincidental with the interstate real estate transactions in terms of time, more importantly in their view, in terms of continuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.481" offset="2529645">The critical reason for that determination was the need to distinguish essentially local restraints which would have nothing to do with interstate commerce and the specific real estate services provided in that case which did affect interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.319" offset="2588995">And this conclusion I believe is made clear by the language in Goldfarb which specifically recognizes that there may well be legal services which have no effect on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.691" offset="2634553">If one need only identify legal services as a line of business or a class of activities that affect commerce, there would have been no need to first trace the particular relationship of the activities in question in that case with interstate commerce or to go on and say that there may well be legal services which may have no effect on interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="651.226" offset="2736639">There is some rather specific language there at page 242 of 444 U.S.... it says, petitioners need not make the more particularized showing of an effect on interstate commerce caused by the alleged conspiracy to fix commission rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="676.466" offset="2837576">Now, it seems to me those 2 sentences certainly are, are not themselves ambiguous, that you, you can show it by showing the activity that the plaintiffs, rather that the defendants are in.</text>

            <text syncTime="779.643" offset="3250311">It goes on to indicate that they may be able to show then in fact significant amounts of interstate commerce are not required... were not affected or that they were.</text>

            <text syncTime="1029.777" offset="4250905">Notwithstanding the fact that that's not what Section 1 says, one can envision that virtually ever activity that you engage in on a daily basis actually from eating to clothing yourself, to delivering a service or providing for shelter, inevitably has some role as a class of activity or line of business which would affect interstate commerce in the aggregate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.862" offset="4335229">Accordingly, the Government's views appear too broad without limitation and certainly without placing any credence in the notion that the Commerce Clause does not have unlimited power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.763" offset="4382771">Moreover, if the Government's views were correct, this Court's analysis in Yellow Cab, Goldfarb, Trustees of Rex Hospital, and even the language of McLain, finding a real commercial relationship between the anticompetitive conduct and interstate commerce would have been totally unnecessary, because legal services, real estate sales, hospital building in and of themselves, obviously as a class of activities significantly affect interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.893" offset="4487366">Acceptance of the plain meaning of the statute also doesn't mean as the United States and as the various states that filed an amicus brief have said that for some reason anti-competitive activities will go unchallenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.935" offset="4539506">Anti-competitive activity meriting attack on a truly local level is still the subject of enforcement activity at that level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.167" offset="4568450">It's well to remember that the purpose of the passage of the Sherman Act was to supplement state antitrust enforcement efforts, not to supplant them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.507" offset="4605753">This Court has already recently held in California v. ARC America Corporation that the Federal anti-trust laws do not supplant but may be supplemented by other local state government enforcement efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.689" offset="4654549">Now the principle to be applied in this case requiring a restraint which has a not insubstantial effect to interstate commerce, also mandates that the holding of the Ninth Circuit on interstate commerce be reversed for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.074" offset="4708048">First, without any factual record before it or even a factual allegation by the plaintiff, the Ninth Circuit apparently made findings that peer review proceedings in and of themselves have an effect on interstate commerce and peer review proceedings affect the entire medical staff of a hospital and, therefore, interstate commerce is affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.598" offset="4786102">Now both of these statements as I indicated are unsupported by any record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.549" offset="4801984">All we have is a complaint and actually they're incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.126" offset="4812224">Congress, in passing the Health Care Quality Improvement Act, noted that peer review is not essentially commercial activity in the typical case and would not have an adverse effect on interstate commerce certainly in every case as the Ninth Circuit seemed to be positing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.355" offset="4873142">Second, the conclusion that a medical staff proceeding or even a series of medical staff proceedings affect either the hospital's entire medical staff in every case or the hospital's interstate commerce in every case no matter who was or was not actually affected, no matter what the scope of the peer review proceeding might have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.113" offset="4944195">Again, it's simply a factual assertion that is nowhere in the record and is not the case, in particular through the illustrations by the amicus hospital associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.765" offset="4986827">I think the Ninth Circuit's conclusion is analogous to saying because I'm a member of the California Bar Association which is mandatory in California that I am somehow affected by every state bar disciplinary proceeding no matter what the subject was, no matter what its result was, whether I knew about it or I didn't know about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.337" offset="5053073">There is no decision where the court has gone that far or even suggesting that somehow interstate commerce is implicated every time someone is excluded from a medical staff, an organization, an association, or some other membership and for that reason, the Government's views and the Ninth Circuit's views are simply too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.783" offset="5130918">In short, I think the Ninth Circuit decision under any test whether it's a Government's test or whether it's a test that petitioners believe should be applied, should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.138" offset="5168326">In think in conclusion the Court should reverse that portion of the Ninth Circuit decision holding the the existing allegations of the complaint were adequate to assert Sherman Act jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.181" offset="5208450">I think the Court should reaffirm the standard required for Section 1 jurisdiction is an allegation and of controverted proof that anticompetitive restraints must be shown as a matter of practical economics to have a non-insubstantial effect on the interstate commerce involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.035" offset="5267904">Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence Silver</label>
            <text syncTime="1292.327" offset="5301028">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.825" offset="5335091">Certiorari was granted in this case to resolve the conflict in the circuits in its interprets... in the interpretation of McLain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.821" offset="5363095">We have the ninth in Western Waste, the third in Cardio-Medical Associations, the fifth which no one cited in their briefs, Parks, El Paso Board of Realtors and the Eleventh Circuit in Shahawy all deciding that under the clear language of McLain that Justice Scalia and Justice Stevens referred to provided a general business activities' test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.216" offset="5468629">The remaining numbered circuits except for the fourth which has thus far avoided a determination of the issue have determined that the McLain reading is much more narrow and implies an affected activities' test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.415" offset="5517426">What this... this case is controlled by McLain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.928" offset="5539473">But I think we have to take one step back if we can to the Rex Hospital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.833" offset="5555042">No one calls it the hospital building case, but the Rex Hospital case which came before it, that's a plaintiff's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.377" offset="5577299">McLain is a defendant's case and the Pinhas case is a plaintiff/defendant's case and allow me to explain, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.015" offset="5603839">In Rex Hospital a hospital sued for anti-trust violations against another hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.201" offset="5624528">It asserted that the second defendant hospital interfered with its activities to expand its interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.292" offset="5648979">The amicus in that case represented by Weissburg and Aronson asserted quite compellingly in this Court in the unanimous opinion by Mr. Justice Marshall determined that the plaintiff's purchase of medicines, that the plaintiff's receipt of money from Medicare and Medicaid from the Federal Government, that the plaintiff's receipt of supplies from out-of-state sellers, that the plaintiff's insurance receipts from out-of-state insurance companies, and the plaintiff's treatment of patients from out of state was sufficient basis in interstate commerce to justify jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.202" offset="5764544">We then come to McLain, the next case that the Court deals with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.216" offset="5780636">Although Goldfarb is in the middle, Goldfarb is an in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.840" offset="5795160">It didn't have to be I don't think, but the plaintiff's alleged an in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.433" offset="5805504">So Goldfarb is a problem in terms of... in fact the lower court judge in McLain misunderstood that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.290" offset="5824940">In Goldfarb they alleged in commerce rather than affecting commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.320" offset="5837060">In McLain, you had a defendant's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.022" offset="5847823">Plaintiff's... financial people who wanted to sell their houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.459" offset="5857645">Everywhere they went there was a uniform 6 percent I think, rule for commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.582" offset="5874050">Plaintiffs had no interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.705" offset="5886589">They just wanted to sell their house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.737" offset="5890664">They had to rely for jurisdiction on the defendant's activities and only the defendant's activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.733" offset="5914696">If it was the defendant's activities that were not involved, there was no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.827" offset="5927026">This Court found jurisdiction and in so finding, it found that and looked at two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.870" offset="5963284">One, the plaintiff need to show a... interfered with activity as well as demonstrated substantial effect on interstate commerce generated by the brokerage activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.631" offset="6006334">In Western Waste, the Ninth Circuit, the first circuit to interpret McLain, said that these activities could be independent of the violations in Western Waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.066" offset="6048025">The Tenth Circuit filed a decision much later that's different in some respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.842" offset="6071117">But what the Court... there is a claim by the way in the commentators, apparently... I think there is no ambiguity in the opinion in McLain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.450" offset="6105599">I think that McLain clearly holds that if you show those two things, you have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.665" offset="6122422">You may have an offense in some other portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.571" offset="6130050">You may have your case in some other portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.430" offset="6137469">In indeed, if I may just for a moment, depart in answer, if I may, I think Justice Stevens' question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.677" offset="6170487">If you had those 2 weeks of unaffected violations, Justice Stevens, the plaintiff, the harmed party, would certainly want an injunction against those 2 weeks ever occurring again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.734" offset="6214686">And it seems to me to say that unless you have an effect, you cannot get injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.389" offset="6229315">Now certainly the Government would be heard adversely to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.794" offset="6238928">Once you have a conspiracy, an attempted conspiracy, a criminal activity, a civil plaintiff would certainly want to be able, if you were able to show that, to have injunctive relief and if the intended effect or as Mr. Justice Souter says, the tendency toward to have an effect, would certainly give the Court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.898" offset="6299323">If there is an ambiguity, and I don't think there is, but if there is any ambiguity, the way you resolve an ambiguity in language is to look at what the court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.771" offset="6326804">It looked at... all the commentators say 3 things... I think you looked at 4 things: mortgage money, secondary mortgage market, title insurance, and there's one phrase in the opinion that appears that one of the plaintiffs in the claim arranged for an out-of-state relocation with one of the defendants in the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.496" offset="6401723">Now what logical implication did... was there between those 4 things?</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.088" offset="6428159">Mortgage money came from out of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.338" offset="6433070">Secondary mortgage market... some of the mortgages that were procured by the sale of real estate which the commission for the sale was price fixed were sold to out of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.646" offset="6478314">Title insurance companies, some of which to insure the title of the houses that were sold as a result of the commission were from out of state, and by the way, the record was some.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.768" offset="6510811">The mortgage money was some.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.674" offset="6518438">There was no specific definition and then we have the one instance in terms of relocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.170" offset="6536411">Was there a nexus requirement that this Court said that the affected activity must have some nexus to that activity upon which you found jurisdiction?</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.917" offset="6571415">I think if you examine what you looked at and what Chief Justice in writing his opinion looked at, the answer is clearly no.</text>

            <text syncTime="1835.281" offset="7472848">Those are the activities which are... that show interstate commerce and which I think give us Federal court jurisdiction under a general business activities' test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.823" offset="7519033">If you are looking for an affected activity it is peer review in general or peer review and specific in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.445" offset="7545573">I think peer review in general is sufficient to satisfy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.819" offset="7559052">We don't need it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.787" offset="7562918">The Ninth Circuit found that peer review in general... Justice Scalia if you have one ophthalmologist who is wrongfully removed by anti-competitive purposes from this hospital, other ophthalmologists at that hospital will benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.718" offset="7622582">Other physicians may also benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.843" offset="7631150">And consequently, when the Ninth Circuit said there was a nexus because the peer review proceeding in general in my view or peer review proceeding, a bad one in an alternative view, affects the hospital and its delivery of interstate commerce activities because it eliminates one competitor from that market for competing for ophthalmologic surgery rooms, for general surgery rooms, for general beds, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.145" offset="7728326">And the Ninth Circuit made a determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.536" offset="7733864">They made a fact finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.411" offset="7737416">They found what was alleged in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.238" offset="7744731">They made a determination that once you have an anti-competitive peer review proceeding, you can remove that... when you remove one surgeon from the hospital, it affects the whole hospital or it affects their interstate commerce, and therefore, you pass any of the McLain tests in any of the circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.247" offset="7808783">We're happy to be in the Ninth Circuit, but we could meet the circuit... any of the circuits that have spoken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.543" offset="7829890">In this... I think that the Court in, in various opinions... that it has written especially in McLain, has indicated that 2 things are important to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.473" offset="7881612">One, expanding concept of the Commerce Clause is the expanding concept of jurisdiction under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.847" offset="7903137">In addition, expanding and changing concepts of business as Mr.... as the Chief Justice said in McLain and changing concepts of business are also considered under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.326" offset="7957054">It is, if I may paraphrase two Justices Marshall, it is both a constitution and magna carta upon which you are expounding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.604" offset="7990177">The Constitution in the sense that when you interpret the Sherman One Act jurisdiction you are interpreting the Commerce Clause because of all of your cases which both parties have cited in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.148" offset="8024345">So you've said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.085" offset="8032077">In addition, to the extent that you limit access to the Federal courts, in anti-trust cases you limit the Magna Carta that Mr. Justice Marshall so properly called I think Magna Carta free enterprise in Topco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.034" offset="8083904">In terms of the facts, the specific facts of this case, the outrageous conduct to the defendants in this case was to when they found that the... Dr. Pinhas would not agree to the surgical sham contract they wanted to do instead of the assistant surgery rule... and think of the anomaly of it by the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.040" offset="8179931">Here they are in February saying, you're such a great guy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.149" offset="8188394">We want to pay you $60,000 to be a consultant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.289" offset="8196962">And then in April, when he won't return the contract, they summarily suspend him and basically kick him out of that hospital and impair his rights to get into other hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.691" offset="8226533">They then have this sham peer review proceeding with no right of counsel, cross examination, preclusion of witnesses, ordering me off the hospital grounds under threat of arrest, threatening witnesses, and lo and behold, with all of those adverse things and Dr. Pinhas standing with another ophthalmologist... you can read this record and see how well they did cross examination and of other things, they won 6 out of the 7 charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.384" offset="8329246">And do you know what this hospital did?</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.351" offset="8333217">It filed a false report with the, with the Federal... with both the state and the Federal saying that the summary suspension had been upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.505" offset="8365818">And as a result, Dr. Pinhas has had peer review proceeding problems at other hospitals as a direct result we've attached as Exhibit B to our appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.926" offset="8399464">I wanted to tell you that the 805 report of which I am making reference was not available when we filed the first amended complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.969" offset="8427676">It is not part of this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.484" offset="8433736">I filed a request and a motion with the Ninth Circuit to have the Ninth Circuit take judicial notice of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.246" offset="8452753">I don't know whether they did or they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.482" offset="8457664">They never ruled on the motion to take judicial notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.309" offset="8468949">It is part of your record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.011" offset="8475846">As I have indicated I think that the McLain did establish the general business activities' test as a result of what you looked at in terms of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.130" offset="8520254">If it involved an affected activities' test... and I believe by the way that Judge Wiggins did not apply Western Waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.005" offset="8543764">I believe that he applied in a much more narrow standard we fit the affected activities' test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.518" offset="8561841">Even the particularized test that no court has adopted, no circuit court has adopted but which is argued I believe by the Petitioners here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.984" offset="8599666">We can meet that view with leave to amend this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.498" offset="8609802">We can allege a variety of things which can occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.215" offset="8624639">Needless to say I do not think there is any justification for the particularize which we would have to show that, according to the particularized test, that interstate commerce was adversely affected by the specific removal of Dr. Pinhas from the staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.929" offset="8687437">No circuit has ever gone that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.427" offset="8697469">But even so amendment to the complaint dealing with the implications of that clearly can be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.565" offset="8722024">What has happened is a result of this peer review proceeding is nation wide through the national reporting statute under the Health Care Quality Improvements Act reports regarding Dr. Pinhas go nation wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.045" offset="8771970">Reports go to the Board of Medical Quality Assurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.886" offset="8787330">Under state law they're required to be distributed to every hospital which he is a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.182" offset="8800495">I see that I have 5 minutes left and I would like dedicate that 5 minutes to the Government if I may... unless anyone has any questions.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="2178.710" offset="8846575">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.906" offset="8907389">The way the courts of appeals have described the conflict that has developed in applying McLain is something of a false dichotomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.775" offset="8954827">They generally say that on the one side some courts have held that the relevant inquiry is whether any of the defendant's activities or the defendant's general business activities affect commerce and on the other side, courts say the question is whether the challenged conduct, the allegedly illegal conduct in itself affects commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.624" offset="9062242">The relevant inquiry for analyzing a Sherman Act claim is what is the line of commerce or the line of business activity being restrained by the alleged violation and it is in our view that line of activity that must satisfy the interstate commerce nexus, whether or not the defendant is also engaged in additional business activities that affect commerce and whether or not the alleged unlawful conduct in itself also affects Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.983" offset="9227650">And when McLain is read in that light, we believe that it contains no ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.572" offset="9265997">In that case, the complaint was about a price fixing conspiracy among real estate brokerage firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.350" offset="9309152">The court did not have before it whether some of the defendants were also engaged in other business activities, property management for example, because those activities would have been irrelevant to the restraint being alleged and in that light, the... two sentences from the opinion that we have set forth on page 8 of our brief to which Chief Justice Rehnquist has already alluded seem entirely clear to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.945" offset="9455542">The court first says it would be sufficient for Petitioners to demonstrate a substantial effect on interstate commerce generated by Respondent's brokerage activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.846" offset="9507160">Petitioners need not make the more particularized showing of an effect on commerce caused by the alleged conspiracy to fix commission rates or by those other aspects of Respondent's activities alleged to be unlawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="2366.570" offset="9598066">It's, it's not the whole line of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.491" offset="9605694">It's that portion of the line of commerce engaged in by the Respondent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2371.459" offset="9617606">--Respondent's brokerage activities and then there, there is a further question whether their effect on commerce should be looked upon in isolation or as one of a class of activities that Congress can regulate, but before that question arises I want to refer to language appearing later in the McLain opinion which some courts have used to inject ambiguity into the opinion and this appears at page 4... 246 of 444 U.S. and the sentence is at the very top of the page, to establish Federal jurisdiction in this case, there remains only the requirement that Respondent's activities which allegedly have been infected by a price fixing conspiracy must be shown as a matter of practical economics to have a not insubstantial effect on the interstate commerce involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.263" offset="9856783">In context, it seems to us clear that Respondent's activities which have been infected refers to the brokerage activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.086" offset="9900146">If this sentence is to be read consistently with what the court so clearly said just a few pages earlier rather than to read this sentence circuitously to contradict what the court had already said without ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.033" offset="9971931">And so it seems to us that the Court in McLain did what it was striving to do in the context of the argument that was before it which was to reconcile its interpretation of the Sherman Act with the general trend of this Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.350" offset="10065135">The Perez case had already been decided at that time and features very heavily in the arguments before the Court and the Court was well aware of the generous scope of the commerce power that has been recognized in the jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.407" offset="10137338">Now in the case at hand the alleged restrain enforced through the sanction of peer review is on the provision of hospital ophthalmological services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.150" offset="10192404">The complaint alleges that the sanctions were adopted to prevent the Respondent physician from providing more efficient services to patients through faster operations and through elimination of an assistant surgeon in attendance at the operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.111" offset="10280175">It is a charge therefore of anti-competitive practices, of injury to competition in a particular market and the provision of these ophthalmological, surgical services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.404" offset="10337331">What if instead a nurse had complained that she had been excluded from providing services in this activity, services which she seeks to provide in the same manner that they are provided by other nurses?</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.473" offset="10421655">That would seem on the face of it to be a less substantial anti-trust complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.155" offset="10460420">But that is so it seems to us not because the nurses employment relationship with the hospital is beyond Congress' power to reach under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.806" offset="10518935">It obviously can be reached by the Fair Labor Standards Act, the National Labor Relations Act, OSHA, the Aged Employment... the Age Discrimination and Employment Act, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.691" offset="10570553">But on the face of this complaint she has not claimed an injury to competition in any line of commerce, just an injury to herself which is at most an injury to a particular competitor rather than to competition, not what the anti-trust laws are designed to protect.</text>

            <text syncTime="2729.333" offset="11049116">And another key part of the doctor's complaint was that he thought it was unnecessary to have an assistant surgeon and this was adding an element of great cost to the operations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2971.483" offset="12017736">It, it, it, it, it could be considered that, but it has been the basis for expanding the reach of the Sherman Act repeatedly as the court's notions of the reach of the Commerce Clause have similarly expanded because the, the act has been interpreted to afford the protections to whatever is the currently accepted notion of the reach of the commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.222" offset="12128600">So it's a form of dictum that could arguably part of the ratio decidendi of those case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.359" offset="12165171">And another lesson of this Court's Commerce Clause decisions such as Wickard against Filburn is that the substantiality of the effect on commerce is not to be belittle by viewing an individual instance in isolation without regard to the aggregate affect of similar restraints on individuals or the deterrent effect of the sanction applied to this one individual, the deterrent effect on others of similarly attempting to increase efficiency by similar activities if they see that this doctor can be sanctioned for trying to eliminate the assistant surgeon from this procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="3074.176" offset="12428486">I think that the principles that are involved here are distinguishing the Section 1 from other regulatory Commerce Clause type cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.311" offset="12488985">We're fairly... not fairly... we're clearly articulated by Chief Justice Rehnquist in his concurrence in the Hodel against Virginia Surface Mining case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.184" offset="12516466">I think where the Chief Justice indicated that cases such as Perez, Russell, Heart of Atlanta, even Wickard against Filburn could be explained by what Professor Tribe indicates is the cumulative effect principle wherein those cases Congress engaged in specific fact findings, stressing the regulation of local incidence as an activity that was necessary to abate a cumulative evil affecting national commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.986" offset="12615731">Under that type of reasoning Commerce can clearly adopt, regulations which affect child labor laws, could adopt regulations which affect commerce and agriculture, could adopt many acts which govern specific areas such as the civil rights laws where Congress itself engaged in the fact finding which show that those activities affect interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.401" offset="12693367">But despite those holdings and as the Chief Justice noticed some broad dicta in those holdings, there have to be limits and there are limits somewhere on the commerce power and those limits are contained in the language of Section 1 itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.037" offset="12743940">Restraints of trade or commerce among the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.301" offset="12752926">Neither the Respondents nor the Government chose to address, Justice Scalia, your question about what must that language mean, restraint of trade or commerce among the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="3164.625" offset="12790229">But I'm saying even if there aren't any limits on the, on the commerce power, there may be limits to the Sherman Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3172.030" offset="12819904">I think one could read it as there being limits on the commerce power but the court need not go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.949" offset="12839549">One need only look at the specific language of the statute itself and construe the statutory language to say jurisdiction under that statute requires the showing the Petitioners' request.</text>

            <text syncTime="3197.658" offset="12922409">Petitioners agree that would not be enough although Congress could easily call this the line of commerce involving child and home care or the line of commerce involving care of children throughout the country which would obviously have significant import on an interstate commerce basis for the economy as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.340" offset="12989073">I think that illustration is perhaps the best illustration of why the principle that the Government seeks to enforce in this case goes too far.</text>
