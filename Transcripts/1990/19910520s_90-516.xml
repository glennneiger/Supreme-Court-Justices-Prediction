            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73978">In the other case, Kamen versus Kemper Financial Services Incorporated, No. 90-516, is here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.479" offset="135836">In a shareholder derivative action, the plaintiff typically must make a demand on the board of directors before bringing suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.101" offset="174288">The question in this case is whether federal common law recognizes a futility exception in this requirement in a derivative action under the Investment Company Act of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.120" offset="230399">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we hold that a court in such a suit must apply the futility exception as defined by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.360" offset="271359">We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Seventh Circuit.</text>
