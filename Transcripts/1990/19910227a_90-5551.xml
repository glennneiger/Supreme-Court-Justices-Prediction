            <text syncTime="15.872" offset="197902">Edward Schad was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death after a trial at which the evidence presented was that the victim was strangled, and that sometime later Mr. Schad had possession of some of the victim's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.980" offset="254327">Two rules Arizona mechanically applied in Mr. Schad's case allowed the prosecution to obtain this verdict based on this then evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.388" offset="296018">The question... both issues presented in this case presents is whether that verdict obtained by the rigid application of these two rules is constitutionally reliable.</text>

            <text syncTime="57.459" offset="364250">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.841" offset="369788">Although I'm going to discuss each rule separately, that is not how they worked at Mr. Schad's capital trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.863" offset="397896">These two rules, Arizona's one form of verdict rule and Arizona's no lesser included offenses for felony murder rule worked together, mutually reinforcing one another and increasing the risk that the verdict returned against Mr. Schad was erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.625" offset="468949">I will first address the second issue we present in our brief, Arizona's rule that there are no lesser included offenses of felony murder, because it presents a more narrow constitutional issue and it is controlled by Beck v. Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.476" offset="536345">The prosecutor's case for felony murder was built circumstantially.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.720" offset="561318">No direct evidence tied Mr. Schad to the homicide of the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.935" offset="582216">The only evidence connecting him to that crime was his possession of the victim's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.099" offset="610846">The prosecutor argued that because he had possession of the property, the jury could find that he robbed the victim and that he killed the victim during the course of that robbery, and was therefore guilty of felony murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.619" offset="672913">The defense used that same evidence to argue their defense that, because he had possession of the property but because there was no evidence directly tieing him to the homicide, that perhaps the jury could find him a thief, perhaps a robber, but not a murderer.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.415" offset="760057">Because of Arizona's mandatory rule precluding lesser included offenses for felony murder, the judge refused to instruct the jury on the offense of robbery or on the offense of theft, which under Arizona law is a lesser included offense of robbery.</text>

            <text syncTime="417.586" offset="1804746">Because of the substantial risk where the jury believes that one of the elements has not been established beyond a reasonable doubt, but that they do believe the defendant is clearly guilty of some wrong doing as occurred here, there really was very little question that Mr. Schad done something.</text>

            <text syncTime="465.617" offset="1996903">This case presents a preclusion rule no different than Beck.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.181" offset="2019159">And we ask this Court to reverse the conviction of Mr. Schad on that basis because this jury was not able to return that verdict.</text>

            <text syncTime="3484.099" offset="14070804">That's exactly our point on the Beck issue, that this jury had no rational option if they did have a rational doubt about one of the elements of felony murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.746" offset="14117406">And the supreme court, when it reviewed this issue, and it set forth in the joint appendix, found that the evidence would have supported a verdict for robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.342" offset="14151783">But that this jury was not given that option to return that verdict because of the preclusion rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.796" offset="14177592">I also want to very quickly state that, contrary to what Mr. Ford said, the prosecutor in this trial very clearly argued the different factual routes, and we have set out that portion of the argument in our joint appendix at page 6 and 7.</text>
