            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73988">The opinion of the Court in No. 89-1500, Business Guides versus Chromatic Communications Enterprises will be announced by Justice O’Connor.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="9.864" offset="113381">This case comes to us on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.460" offset="135741">The question presented is whether Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which allows a judge to impose sanctions when signed documents are filed that had no basis in law or fact, imposes an objective standard of reasonable inquiry on a represented party who signed such a document.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.366" offset="227379">We hold that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.821" offset="237201">The petitioner, Business Guides, filed a copyright infringement action in Federal Court against the respondent, Chromatic Communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.051" offset="274190">Representatives of the plaintiff company signed the complaint and a supporting affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.251" offset="298955">The District Court learned that the law suit had absolutely no basis in fact, sighting the seriousness of Business Guides’ improper conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.357" offset="343363">The court invoked Rule 11 and imposed monetary sanctions of the amount that the defendant had spent defending the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.717" offset="384845">Business Guides appealed claiming that Rule 11 applies to attorneys, not to represented parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.418" offset="415565">The Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.266" offset="431030">We agree with the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.142" offset="442524">The purpose of Rule 11 is to curve abuses of the judicial system.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.406" offset="463526">It does this by imposing a certification requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.760" offset="480976">A pleading, or other paper filed with the court must bear the signature of an attorney or a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.667" offset="508561">And that signature certifies that the signer has conducted a reasonable inquiry to ensure that the document is well-grounded in the facts and the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.718" offset="552760">The text of Rule 11 makes clear that it applies equally the signatures of attorneys and of parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.374" offset="583480">We hold that a represented party, who signs a pleading motion or other paper, has an affirmative duty to conduct a reasonable inquiry into the facts and the law, and the standard is one of reasonableness under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.016" offset="645965">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.908" offset="657564">Justice Kennedy has filed a dissenting opinion which Justices Marshall and Stevens have joined and as to parts one, three, and four which Justice Scalia has joined.</text>
