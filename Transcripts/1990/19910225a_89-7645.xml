            <text syncTime="20.462" offset="208312">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="23.865" offset="221895">This case presents a narrow issue under the Court's decision in Batson v. Kentucky, an issue important not only the petitioner here but to every other Puerto Rican and Latino in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.458" offset="280305">The issue in this case boils down to whether or not after a prima facie case of discrimination in the selection of jurors, a prosecutor can respond by simply saying, I did not exclude Latino jurors because they were Latino.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.603" offset="360867">I excluded these jurors, because they speak and understand Spanish.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.073" offset="378734">The way that this issue arises in this case, Your Honors, is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.560" offset="400677">The petitioner was on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.929" offset="410186">The prosecutor excluded every Latino juror that came before him, using his peremptory challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.350" offset="443832">Thus a prima facie case of discrimination was established under Batson.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.170" offset="463162">The prosecutor was called on to give his reasons for excluding Latino jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.641" offset="485000">At that point the prosecutor said that he and the court had questioned the jurors about an instruction to follow an interpreter.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.764" offset="525543">There was going to be some testimony in Spanish.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.616" offset="536932">And in essence he was asking them whether or not... the jurors... whether or not they could disregard what the witness was going to say in Spanish and rely only on the English language rendition of that testimony provided by the interpreter.</text>

            <text syncTime="115.458" offset="588236">Well, now, if that reason is true that that was the basis for the prosecutor's strike, are you arguing that there can be no peremptory strike on that basis?</text>

            <text syncTime="3178.124" offset="12838934">--That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.059" offset="12842695">I presume that if the issue comes up in a particular trial the court may very well explain to the jurors what their particular responsibility... responsibility is in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.199" offset="12891283">If I may conclude, we firmly reject the view that this case represents any retreat from Batson, that it creates, in the words of petitioner, any loophole or exception to Batson or that it means that Batson does not apply to Latinos?</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.459" offset="12956276">The reality is that the reason in this case cannot be... that Latinos will continue to be judged by their individual ability to serve in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.934" offset="13006222">All this case stands for we submit is the proposition that Latinos, like other jurors, who actually exhibit during the course of a voir dire, a case-related, record-supported basis to question their ability to serve as jurors in a particular case, that they can be subject to a peremptory challenge in the absence of a finding that the district attorney intended to discriminate in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.549" offset="13100680">That's what the New York Court of Appeals found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.501" offset="13112488">That's what this Court's equal protection analysis says, identified in Batson holds, and therefore, we respectfully urge that this Court affirm the holding of the New York Court of Appeals in this case.</text>
