            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text>We'll hear argument now in No. 89-994, West Virginia University Hospitals v. Robert Casey.</text>
            <text>Mr. Adams.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>The issue in this case is whether experts' fees are compensable under the provisions of 42 U.S.C. section 1988.</text>
            <text>West Virginia University Hospitals asked the Court to decide this issue in the only way that would achieve Congress' stated intent to give civil rights litigants the opportunity to recover what it cost them to vindicate their rights in court.</text>
            <text>The fee-shifting provision in section 1988, intended by Congress to be a full and complete remedy, enables the Federal courts to return to their pre-Alyeska fee-shifting practices, and those practices included the shifting of experts' fees.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, Mr. Adams, what the statute says I guess is that court may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.</text>
            <text>Now do you say expert fees are attorney's fees or do you say they are other parts of the costs?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>We say that expert fees are part of the attorney's fee, because they are part of the work product.</text>
            <text>In other words, reasonable attorney's fee is a term of art.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Even though concededly experts are not attorneys.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>Concededly--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And they don't do attorneys' work.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>--Concededly they are not, but before the... before the attorney can do his work, he's got to work with that expert so he knows how to present his client's case and how to prove it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, that would be true of any witness.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>But with respect to expert witnesses, it's particularly important because when you're dealing with civil rights litigation, it's a rare case when you can have that kind of litigation go forward without an expert.</text>
            <text>I think the thing that drives that--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, that's true of... you can say that about any... you can't win a lawsuit without a witness unless it's just a question of law.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>--That's true, but if you have fact witnesses you subpoena them and they come to trial and they're going to testify.</text>
            <text>Expert witnesses unfortunately have rents to pay, college tuitions to pay and they normally will request some fee for their services.</text>
            <text>But I think the point that drives us home is the fact that when Congress enacted the fee-shifting provision in section 1988, it did not sail into uncharted waters.</text>
            <text>Instead, it selected the language of title VII's--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, an attorney... an attorney can certainly get... they can get attorney's fees and they can recover a fee that reflects the time the attorney spent with an expert witness.</text>
            <text>If he... he goes and finds them and he forks him up, and he knows his testimony.</text>
            <text>He can get him an attorney's fee for that.</text>
            <text>But you say that included in the attorney's fees is the separate sum that he must pay the expert?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>--Yes, sir, I do.</text>
            <text>We would respectfully submit--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And he... and the expert is a witness?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>--The expert can be a witness.</text>
            <text>Sometimes he is not.</text>
            <text>In this particular case it turned out that all of our experts ended up testifying.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Uh-huh.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>We would respectfully submit to the Court that the starting point for this Court's analysis of this issue ought to be the same starting point that this Court employed in the case of Missouri v. Jenkins.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But you would... you would be making the same argument even if these experts did not testify?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>I would be making the same argument.</text>
            <text>Yes, sir.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>I guess that's... because you say the $30 provision just doesn't cover this.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>Just doesn't pay and quite candidly, Your Honor, in today's litigation the attorney I think most often goes out, finds the experts, gets them acquainted with the case so they can do their work, and in most instances, even though there may be the initial expectation that the fee is going to be paid for by the client, I can assure you that that expert is going to look to that lawyer in the law firm to makes sure that he bill gets paid to some extent.</text>
            <text>And that's very important to a lawyer, because if he is able to find quality people to be experts and all of a sudden his experts don't get paid, I would submit that it's going to be very hard for that attorney to attract that expert again or other experts of like quality when they hear that their fee is going to go unsatisfied.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Adams, I guess there are a number of Federal statutes where there is express provision made for expert witnesses?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>Yes, Your Honor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And their fees?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>Yes, Your Honor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And that was not done in section 1988.</text>
            <text>Should that be a concern to us?</text>
            <text>Congress knows how to provide for them expressly.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>I think that is probably the best argument that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has.</text>
            <text>But I think when the argument is examined, it doesn't wash and for a couple of reasons, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>First of all, just as an initial matter, you would have to completely ignore the legislative intent behind the fee-shifting provision in section 1988.</text>
            <text>Secondly, what you're really suggesting is that Congress must use particular words and particular ways every time it legislates.</text>
            <text>You effectively place Congress into a legislative drafting straightjacket which is pretty much akin to the way we used to have old common law pleading, and courts and lawyers who were trained in pleading found that to be an unworkable situation.</text>
            <text>And I would submit it would not be appropriate to place Congress in an equivalent situation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, I guess it's not unreasonable to think that we should apply the common ordinary understanding of the words that Congress does choose to employ.</text>
            <text>That's not putting Congress in a straightjacket, would you say?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>It is not.</text>
            <text>But when you find plain evidence of a legislative intent to work some other result, then the result would be if you followed a plain language construction--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, but it's just a little bit of a stretch isn't it to say an attorney's fee includes fees paid to experts?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>--With respect, Your Honor, I would disagree and for this reason.</text>
            <text>If you examine both the Senate report and the House report, both reports specifically comment that they are selecting title VII's fee-shifting language and they say the reasons for that selection... they said, number 1, the courts are familiar with these terms.</text>
            <text>They have interpreted these terms and have given them meaning, and furthermore they cite case law that have interpreted title VII's fee-shifting language.</text>
            <text>And when you examine that case law, they have interpreted title VII's language to embrace experts' fees.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, and you think that every committee member who signed on to that report not only read those cases and knew that that's what those cases said... that they covered not only attorney's fees but also expert fees.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>I think that's the presumption, Your Honor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And it's also the presumption not only that the other members of the Congress read those committee reports, but also that the other members of Congress also read those cases that were cited in the committee reports, even though the committee... as I understand it the committee reports don't even say explicitly that experts' fees are covered.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>That's correct.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>All they do is cite these cases which had held that experts' fees were covered.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>That's correct.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And the theory of the matter is that from that citation of the cases we can be sure that the whole committee and the whole Congress intended expert fees to be covered.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>I think that's the evidence that would be before the court, and I don't think there's any evidence to contradict that particularly when you examine--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, there's the evidence of the language which says attorney's fees and the evidence of other statutes which say attorney's fees and expert fees are recoverable.</text>
            <text>Now, if I'm a member of Congress and voting on that statute, I'm not going to go and read a committee report and then read the cases cited in the committee report.</text>
            <text>I'm going to know that when we say attorney's fees, we mean attorney's fees and when we say attorney's fees and expert fees, we mean both.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>No, but this goes beyond legislative history.</text>
            <text>This goes relying on nothing but the name of a case which you expect the members of Congress to have read.</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>--But I think, Your Honor, when you look at the entire set of contemporaneous circumstances that surrounded the enactment of this fee-shifting provision, it is absolutely clear in my opinion that the Congress wanted to abrogate the effects of Alyeska with respect to civil rights litigation.</text>
            <text>And they were particularly concerned that when they took this legislative action that they supply something that was a meaningful and fully compensatory remedy.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>--Not true, Your Honor, and let me explain why.</text>
            <text>I would direct the Court's attention to page B48 in the petition's... appendix.</text>
            <text>There the district court discusses the testimony of Dr. James Vertrees, who was the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's expert.</text>
            <text>And the reason the district court was discussing that particular testimony was that Dr. Vertrees had clearly testified that the imposition of Pennsylvania's payment system on a hospital such as my client had the potential, the real potential of bankrupting a large university teaching hospital.</text>
            <text>And that's particularly serious in a Medicaid program, because if you examine the legislative history to the Social Security Act you will find that Congress had an express concern for these large teaching hospitals that... to put it bluntly... are the dumping grounds of... for poor patients.</text>
            <text>And so my client as I said... it had a cash flow, but I would respectfully submit my client did not have a deep pocket that was unending.</text>
            <text>So, it's very important if we're going to continue to deliver... in my client's case... needed health care to our indigent citizens that they are able to recover what it costs them to vindicate their rights in Federal court.</text>
            <text>I would point out to the Court with respect that this Court has not shied away from rejecting plain language arguments when it has come to section 1988.</text>
            <text>Missouri v. Jenkins was not the first time this Court so held.</text>
            <text>I would point you specifically to the Christiansburg Garment case where you rejected that kind of argument because it would have frustrated Congress' intend.</text>
            <text>Likewise in related fee-shifting statutes, EAJA, for example, the Clean Air Act shifting statute, you have not given any credence to arguments based on minor variations in language between one statute and another.</text>
            <text>You have been more concerned about ensuring that Congress' intent behind those statutes was followed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Yeah, except that, you know, if we ignore the plain language of what the statute and says and goes to what Congress intended, I doubt whether very many members of Congress thought that civil rights actions consisted of suits by hospitals, for-profit hospitals, some of them, for millions of dollars that were wrongfully withheld under a statute for Medicaid treatments.</text>
            <text>I don't... how many members of Congress do you think would consider that a civil rights action.</text>
            <text>That's what they had in mind when they were talking about civil rights actions?</text>
            <text>I doubt very many.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, the way to answer it is the statute says what it says and it describes this kind of an action and that's good enough.</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>--I disagree, because I think if Congress was truly serious about making any kind of promise to the American people it had to be a substantial promise not a hollow promise, and I would submit it is a hollow promise if expert witnesses cannot be made available to all civil rights litigants.</text>
            <text>I would also respectfully submit that the adoption of the construction that we are proffering to the Court is fully consistent with the notion that we are dealing with a remedial statute that is entitled to a broad construction.</text>
            <text>Furthermore, we believe that that notion of a broader construction than the one being offered up by Pennsylvania is also consistent with the notion of work product as we find that mentioned in the Jenkins case, because this Court has said that the work product doctrine is an intensely practical doctrine grounded in the realities of litigation, and experts are a reality of litigation whether we like it or not.</text>
            <text>West Virginia's construction, we believe, is fully consistent with every expression of legislative intent that we can find.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>--A qualified yes, Your Honor, and let me explain the qualification.</text>
            <text>As we understand the legislative history behind section 1988, Congress intended to restore the courts to what their practice had been in fee-shifting prior to the Alyeska decision.</text>
            <text>I am not here to suggest that that means that we should vest into the Federal courts the ability to further expand whatever that equitable fee-shifting policy was.</text>
            <text>Instead I'm suggesting whatever it was in 1975 that's what Congress intended to give back.</text>
            <text>Now, if investigators... which are not a part of this case... but if investigators had been considered a part of the appropriate fee shifting under pre-Alyeska practice, yes, I would give you the... I... a yes answer to that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Do you think prior to Alyeska it was an accepted practice to shift... shift the cost for expert witness fees to the loser?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>Yes, sir, and the court exercising its discretion, and if you examine our footnote 15 on page 18 of the opening brief, you'll see what we hope is a fairly complete list of the reported cases on that point.</text>
            <text>We have certainly found no reported case that suggests otherwise nor have we seen any case cited by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for a contrary position.</text>
            <text>Well, we believe that the construction that we would offer to you today is consistent with the intent to encourage the private enforcement of civil rights.</text>
            <text>We think it's consistent with the notion of creating a broad remedy.</text>
            <text>We think it's consistent with the purpose of equalizing the resources between the litigants and we do think it is fully consistent with a continuation of the pre-Alyeska practice.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Adams, I suppose in any event if these witnesses were to testify in court that the Crawford case would limit the payment to $30 a day.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>I've given that a great deal of thought, Your Honor, and I can say that, yes, you can probably construct an argument where you could draw the line in that fashion, but I don't really think that's the correct place to draw the line.</text>
            <text>The reason being--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Crawford said at least in the opinion that expert witnesses are limited by the statute to $30 a day, absent explicit authorization to the contrary.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>--Yes, ma'am... yes, Your Honor, but two responses to qualify my answer.</text>
            <text>Number one, if you examine the provisions of section 1821 which was the subject matter of Crawford, clearly Congress... there's a clear recognition that Congress might come in with some other fee-shifting statute to supplant 1821, 1920, and 54.</text>
            <text>And we believe 1988 is such a statute.</text>
            <text>And my second point has just gone out of my head and I apologize for that.</text>
            <text>But going back to Pennsylvania's arguments.</text>
            <text>We believe when you examine their arguments that they are plainly inconsistent with the expressions of legislative intent that we can find for this statute.</text>
            <text>It would not encourage private enforcements at least in those cases where the civil rights plaintiff does not have the means to proceed.</text>
            <text>It's not a fully complete remedy.</text>
            <text>It's an incomplete remedy.</text>
            <text>There certainly would be no level playing field between a State actor who can access the State treasury and the private litigant.</text>
            <text>And lastly, the pre-Alyeska practice simply is not restored.</text>
            <text>We think in the final analysis reasonable attorney's fee is a term of art.</text>
            <text>It's just as Judge Posner described it in the Friedrich case.</text>
            <text>It's a shorthand expression.</text>
            <text>And I can only go back and iterate the point that I made earlier, that Congress did--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>--I think the way he phrased it is it's a shorthand expression for what the courts were doing, what was taken away from them, and what Congress then restored to them.</text>
            <text>And that's why I would go back to the point where if we try to draw lines between testimonial and nontestimonial services, it seems to me that really the better approach is to look at what pre-Alyeska practice was, and I don't believe that line drawing took place at that time.</text>
            <text>I see that my time is about up.</text>
            <text>I'd like to reserve the balance for rebuttal, if I may.</text>

            <label>Mr. Calvin R. Koons</label>
            <text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text>We believe the starting point for the Court's analysis in this case should begin with the Crawford decision rather than the Missouri v. Jenkins opinion.</text>
            <text>In Crawford the court specifically said that the $30 a day limit for attendance fees for witnesses in Federal court was fully applicable to expert witnesses and further said that this limitation would be respected or had to be respected by Federal courts unless there was some explicit statutory authorization which would modify the limit.</text>
            <text>The court went on to say that repeals by implication were not favored and that it would not likely infer that the limitations of the $30 a day limit would be repealed absent some statute or authority explicitly referring to witness fees.</text>
            <text>Quite simply, 1988... section 1988 upon which petitioner relies to shift the cost of expert witness fees contains no specific authorization.</text>
            <text>It contains no specific authorization either in the plain language of the statute, which refers to a reasonable attorney's fee and not a witness fee, nor does it contain any explicit statutory authorization in the legislative history which contains in the comments and the floor debates no reference to witness fees whatsoever.</text>
            <text>And finally,--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Excuse me, may I ask you a question about your interpretation of the plain language, just focusing on the language for a minute?</text>
            <text>Do you read the statute as saying it authorizes the prevailing party in the discretion of the court to recover, one, attorney's fees; and secondly, where it says costs, does that mean taxable costs to you?</text>
            <text>What does the word costs mean?</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="calvin_r_koons">
            <label>Mr. Calvin R. Koons</label>
            <text>--Well, we didn't challenge it in this case, Your Honor.</text>
            <text>We think that the argument of the Petitioner really boils down to this that they're asking the Court to rewrite the language of the statute because they say that its purpose would be better served and that it would be a better law.</text>
            <text>It would effectuate Congress' purpose better if it included more things.</text>
            <text>We think that it is certainly true that Congress intended to promote private enforcement of civil rights laws, but that it did not intend to write a blank check.</text>
            <text>It chose a very specific means to do that.</text>
            <text>The means that it chose was to award a reasonable attorney's fees and to shift that major expense of litigation in favor of the prevailing party.</text>
            <text>It did this also to make legal representation available to civil rights plaintiffs.</text>
            <text>It's certainly true that Congress could have done more.</text>
            <text>Congress could have said that it wanted to provide all expenses of litigation.</text>
            <text>It could have said it wanted to award treble damages or liquidated damages, but it did not.</text>
            <text>Now, clearly all of those things would have done more to encourage private enforcement of civil rights actions.</text>
            <text>But Congress did not choose those avenues, and it would be no more proper to write into the law an expert witness fee as part of the cost than it would be to include those items as well.</text>
            <text>We say that the Court should respect the limits of the language that Congress used, which deserve certainly as much respect as the ends, as well as respect the limits that Congress set on taxable costs in 1920 and 1821.</text>
            <text>Secondly, we say that the legislative history does not show that Congress meant to include expert witness fees.</text>
            <text>The fees... the only reference that petitioner can point to are several witnesses who at the subcommittee level requested that expert fees added... would be added.</text>
            <text>The issue of witness fees is never mentioned in any report or in floor debates and there is certainly no evidence of clear congressional intent, such as the court in Crawford said it would require, even by examining a legislative history.</text>
            <text>Congress specified in other pieces of litigation when it wanted to award expert witness fees as part of the costs.</text>
            <text>For example, in... many cases which we've cited at pages 34 and 37 or statutes of our brief, Congress specified reasonable attorney's fees as well as expert witness fees.</text>
            <text>Some of these statutes were passed right around the time the amendments to section 1988 were being debated, the Toxic Substance Act, for example, the Natural Gas Pipe Line Safety Act, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.</text>
            <text>So, it does appear that Congress knew how to specify both expert fees and attorney's fees when it wanted to do so, and here it did not.</text>
            <text>We say, again, that the result that we're urging is not in conflict with the court's decision in Missouri v. Jenkins, because in that case we did not have a specific statute which governed the item of cost as we have here and in addition it is a different thing we think to say that... that attorney's fees may include paralegal time than to say that it may include expert witness time.</text>
            <text>Paralegals are a separate class of legal assistant who are trained in the law and who typically do for lawyers at a cheaper rate that kind of work that they would have to do themselves otherwise.</text>
            <text>They do work which typically eventuates into a legal work product.</text>
            <text>That's not the case with expert witnesses or with any witness.</text>
            <text>Witnesses are in the business of giving testimony of producing evidence, and we think that to apply the term attorney's fee to witnesses would really be to distort it beyond all recognition and deprive it of all meaning whatsoever.</text>
            <text>In conclusion, we think our construction fairly gives effect to all three statutes as Congress wrote them, is fully in accordance with Crawford and is not inconsistent with Jenkins, and respects the fact that in some statues Congress chose to shift both expert fees and attorney's fees and in other statute it did not.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>I don't believe that the record shows that and that is not correct, because as a matter of fact it was myself and my colleague, Mrs. Krebs, who essentially located the experts for the hospital to see whether or not there was a case to bring in view of the hospital's belief that they were not getting paid the right amount of money.</text>

            <text>--And what about the billing?</text>
            <text>Does the record reflect that the billing went directly to the client?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>The record doesn't reflect, but I will stipulate that the billing did go straight from the experts to the client after it had been approved by me.</text>
            <text>But I think the point that's so crucial, particularly in modern civil rights litigation, is that lawyers do not sit in their ivory tower by themselves.</text>
            <text>They sit there next to their experts, and if you deny the attorney access--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Koons, this is also true in the antitrust litigation.</text>
            <text>Do you know what the practice is with the fee-shifting provisions of the antitrust laws?</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>--Your Honor, I stayed so far away from the antitrust laws I would not even want to hazard a guess on that.</text>
            <text>I don't have an answer for you.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>There are a lot of experts there and it's been a fee-shifting statute that's been on the books a long time.</text>
            <text>But you don't know what the answer is there?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>I really do not.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But... you're arguing that, you know, gee, you can't have an attorney without... without all these experts.</text>
            <text>It would really apply across the board to every other kind of statute as well.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>That's true, but you know there is one unique distinction about 1988 in comparison to all these other fee-shifting statutes that we have.</text>
            <text>And that is, to the best of my knowledge, 1988 is a statute which addresses not only violations of Federal statutory law that is the... in place to address constitutional violations.</text>
            <text>We have one in this case, a violation found by the district court of the equal protection clause.</text>
            <text>And I find it somewhat amazing that you could have a fee-shifting statute that, granted, is part of a very important national policy for the environment which covers the experts, but when you get to the area of constitutional violations, Congress was somehow inept and didn't cover fees in that arena?</text>
            <text>It just doesn't make sense, with all due respect.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, maybe it thought... you know, when you think of environmental litigation, you think of experts right away.</text>
            <text>When you think of civil rights cases, as I think civil rights cases meant... what civil rights cases meant to Congress, you don't as automatically think of expert witnesses.</text>

          <turn speaker="robert_t_adams">
            <label>Mr. Robert T. Adams</label>
            <text>That may be true, but as a matter of fact today if we are to give honor to this notion of work product, this intensely practical doctrine, I think the court ought to.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But I would... you would then be making the same argument in... on... in any other fee-shifting statute which simply said the prevailing plaintiff in this kind of a case is entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees.</text>
