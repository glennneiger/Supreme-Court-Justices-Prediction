            <text syncTime="64.775" offset="396636">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="67.998" offset="409593">This is the thirteenth time or fourteenth time that black citizens from Texas and Mexican Americans from Texas have been before this Court to ask for relief against practices of the State of Texas which denied or limited their participation in the electorial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.292" offset="486706">Some of those cases involved overt practices of the State which directly excluded it.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.356" offset="510948">Others involved, as this case does, subtle practices which limited their participation in the electoral process.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.579" offset="539892">Congress, we submit, sought to address that problem when it amended the rights... the Voting Rights Act in 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.526" offset="579702">And we are here today to ask that the intent of Congress in the amendment in 1982 be carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.811" offset="612826">We have in Texas a number of African Americans and Mexican Americans who today are excluded from or limited in the participation in the election of judges in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.809" offset="660786">We ask that they be permitted, as Congress directed, to participate on an equal basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.975" offset="689417">The issue here is whether section 2 of the Voting Rights Act as amended in 1982 applies to the election of judges in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.012" offset="725570">The district court held that the plaintiffs had established a violation of section 2 and directed interim relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.456" offset="759425">The Fifth Circuit with the majority of the court held that section 2 did not apply to the election of judges at all because it read 2(b) to exclude judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.995" offset="809580">A concurring opinion held that section 2 applied to the election of all offices including judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.879" offset="841031">But in its view there was some unique feature of judges in the district court level in Texas which limited or prohibited the application of section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.827" offset="880842">It found that judges in Texas or the State had an interest in tieing the electorate to the judiciary... to the authority of the judges in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.662" offset="916159">And it found that there was some single-person office in the way that judges were classified.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.016" offset="945626">The Government advances another theory, and we submit one that is not permitted by the Voting Rights Act, that in some way the Court should weigh, and in some instances permit, State interest to trump deprivations of rights of minorities in the electoral process.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.438" offset="1023262">There is nothing in the Voting Rights Act of 1982 that permits that kind of analysis and that kind of weight to be given to the State interest that is being asserted in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.986" offset="1073521">With respect to the majority opinion, we rely on the positions that were advanced by the petitioners and the Government in the Chisom case which you just heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.705" offset="1116362">I would like to turn, unless there is some further question about coverage, to the issues that were raised by the concurring opinion and to the issues that have been presented by the Government brief or amicus brief in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="324.861" offset="1437041">And it suggested in section 2(b) how that result might be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.983" offset="1453446">So I think 2(a) clearly holds... provides that one can establish a violation here for the election of judges, including trial judges, under 2(a).</text>

            <text syncTime="539.650" offset="2296156">I'd like to turn to the assertions that there were State interests that warranted not applying section 2 to the situation in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.476" offset="2339415">First, I would point out that section 2, as enacted by Congress, requires a type of analysis that does not permit a per se exclusion for the application of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.620" offset="2408065">The Congress was trying to provide protection for minorities who were limited in their participation in the electoral process.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.643" offset="2436173">And the Congress set up a structure for an analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.705" offset="2448398">And the only place where you really begin to look at State interest is under one of the factors that Congress listed, which talks about tenuousness of a State practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.381" offset="2487059">Here if the plaintiff put this issue into consideration, the Court is to look and see whether the assertive State practice is tenuous, and if it finds it is or if it finds it's not, that's just the factor that the... that the Court is to look at and make a determination in the totality of the circumstances whether there is in fact vote dilution.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.354" offset="2566994">It is never, I submit, a bar to one's establishment of a dilution and a particular electoral process.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.562" offset="2599804">Second, here there was no evidence offered I submit that warranted a court deciding that it would bar... that as a State's interest... application of section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.229" offset="2642435">If we go through and look at the actual State practices that were involved, we'll see that there is no justification for really asserting... that there is some strong, significant State interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.178" offset="2690292">For example, we hear that tieing the jurisdiction to the electorate in some way promoted accountability.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.833" offset="2716937">But district judges in Texas have Statewide jurisdiction, not just county jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.677" offset="2740238">They had issued decisions that affect the whole State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1719.242" offset="7014497">But that doesn't answer the question about whether the statute is so clear you can tell it covers judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.444" offset="7035291">I disagree with one of the Justices who answered that the Court... and I think it was Justice White... who answered that the Court had decided that the original section 2 in 1965 covered judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.932" offset="7081266">The Court has never decided that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.334" offset="7086909">The Court has never addressed that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.953" offset="7093387">In Mobile v. Bolden, without considering coverage of judges, the Court in rather an offhand manner... I don't mean the analysis was offhand, but the State... the use of the language was offhand I believe... in rather offhand manner said that section 2 is coextensive with the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.237" offset="7162455">In Rogers v. Lodge 2 years later, it was stated differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.607" offset="7175934">The Court said section 2 reaches no further than the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.923" offset="7197250">There is a difference there, and it's an importance difference for the analysis of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.177" offset="7214282">If you go back to 1965, as Mobile v. Bolden pointed out, the legislative history on section 2 is sparse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.461" offset="7239359">This Court has noted that there is extensive debate in the 60... during the '65 on the preclearance provisions, the rules about doing away with literacy test, the rules about access to the poll question that were such a horror in the South at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.863" offset="7297038">And it... it's clear that in 1965 Congress was trying to do away with a lot of those horrors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.786" offset="7324728">But there is no indication that Congress in 1965 addressed judges in section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.240" offset="7350537">It didn't even think about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.743" offset="7356493">It didn't even think about it in 1960... in 1982 either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.666" offset="7372270">And in 1982, Congress was using a power, the enforcement clause power, which is a much more hemmed-in power, I would say, than the... its power to straight out announce what the Constitution covers under section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment and section 1 of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.447" offset="7443324">So during the 17 years, from 1965 to 1982, there is no... there's no empirical evidence that section 2 covered judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.484" offset="7483448">There was not a single statutory section 2 case involved... vote dilution case involving judges reported anywhere in the annals of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.912" offset="7517198">There is not a single effects standard case involving judges, either under the Constitution or the statute, during that 17-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.856" offset="7548963">There was one case... Fifth Circuit case that was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.908" offset="7561188">There was no trial of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.530" offset="7567666">The... 12 beat 6 dismissal at the trial court level.</text>

            <label>Mr. Julius LeVonne Chambers</label>
            <text syncTime="3273.478" offset="13231431">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.189" offset="13234357">First, I'd like to note that the Senate factors are reported on pages 29... 28 to 30 of the Senate report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.515" offset="13275630">Second, with respect to coverage... and we call of course attention again to section 14(c)(1), which clearly shows that the act applies to all voting, whatever the position is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.157" offset="13350132">I'd like to just address briefly the question of single-person office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.121" offset="13366014">And to point out that what we have in Texas, for example in Harris County, are 59 separate judges or 59 judges for the State representing 2.4 million people; 20-some percent or so of those are minority voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.094" offset="13433933">They are unable to elect a representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.956" offset="13445426">And these 59 people, although occupying a position that permits them to make a decision on a particular case, are certainly in positions that can be divided among the electorate to give the minorities a change to elect a representative or to participate more effectively in the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.968" offset="13513449">There is not case that I know of that goes off on the function of the office once the State decides to make the office elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.663" offset="13540199">What we look at is whether this office is so unique that it cannot be divided among the electorate in order to eliminate the impairment of the minority voters in that particular district.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.011" offset="13585547">And here clearly these judges can be subdivided to permit minorities to have an effective role or an equal role in the election of judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.628" offset="13624104">That's what we are asking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.690" offset="13628284">And I think that in the concurring opinion suggestion that these were single-person offices which prohibited a vote dilution analysis was simply not following out the objective of Congress in section 2, because these positions, just like the legislative position, can be subdivided and minorities will have a chance to participate more effectively in the... in the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.974" offset="13721488">No one suggests that any of the judges subdivided would have less authority than the judges who presently occupy those positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.849" offset="13752940">What we suggest is that they be permitted to vote... that minorities be permitted to vote to elect a representative member of the... of the bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.637" offset="13796094">Closing off that opportunity, we submit, would be contrary to what Congress has suggested in the... in the statute other than the legislative history of the--</text>

            <text syncTime="3424.894" offset="13837159">Mr Chambers, do you know of any jurisdiction that today is using cumulative voting for the election of judges?</text>

            <text syncTime="3431.960" offset="13865371">--Yes, Your Honor, in the... our brief we point out two cases in Alabama that has approved of cumulative voting for the election I believe of county commissioners in that particular... that district.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.889" offset="13917093">There's also the case that--</text>

            <text syncTime="3448.833" offset="13932871">--The court approved it was settlement, Your Honor... that included that method of electing representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.645" offset="13952097">And then we have the Pennsylvania case that's also cited in material that approves of a limited voting method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.340" offset="13978951">And again there is ample literature that points out that cumulative or limited voting would permit the... a system to adjust or deal with the dilution of minority voters without materially altering the particular structure that's there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.363" offset="14055020">Also, with respect to the legislative history, we would point on pages 13 and 19 of the amicus brief of the Lawyers' committee there is a listing or citation of a number of instances in which Congress looked at the election of judges in considering the 1982 amendment to the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.516" offset="14135582">So Congress was aware that the... the proponents were asking for coverage of the most important section of the local governments that continue to affect minority voters.</text>
