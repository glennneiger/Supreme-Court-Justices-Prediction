            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73964">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in Demarest versus Manspeaker in No. 89-5916.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.814" offset="105206">The petitioner in this case was an inmate in a state prison, who testified in a Federal Criminal Trial pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum, which is the Latin meaning for a writ that you use to get a prisoner to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.538" offset="172080">Ordinarily, you just issue a subpoena for person that is in civilian life, so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.349" offset="191306">But for a prisoner, you have to get a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum that is directed to the warden of the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.911" offset="221608">The petitioner testified and he requested witness fees for his testimony in accordance with Section 1821 of the judicial code, which entitles witnesses in attendance of a federal trial to receive $30 a day for their services.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.734" offset="280854">The District Court and the Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit denied petitioner's request for a fees on a ground that Section 1821 did not authorize the payment of witness fees to prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.308" offset="327143">The language of 1821, however, contains no exception for prisoners who testify pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.339" offset="363296">By its terms, a provision applies to all witnesses in attendance except for detained alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.254" offset="386911">Because congresses language is clear, the fact that administrative agencies have not paid witness fees to prisoners in the past is not controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.753" offset="420975">We therefore, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, our opinion is unanimous.</text>
