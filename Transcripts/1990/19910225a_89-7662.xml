            <text syncTime="16.907" offset="186704">On May 19, 1987, the Supreme Court of Virginia, in an order that appears at page 25 and 26 of the Joint Appendix, issued a decision dismissing the appeal of Roger Keith Coleman on the ground that it had been filed 1 day late.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.366" offset="340513">When one examines the face of this order, one immediately sees that it is an ambiguous order.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.656" offset="381682">The issues of Federal law that Mr. Coleman had asserted in the circuit court below were the subject of extensive briefing before the Virginia Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.416" offset="436748">And in fact in response to a motion to dismiss the appeal as untimely, Mr. Coleman's opposition motion adverted to the merits below, the merits that were covered below and were to be the subject of later briefing, and informed the court of its authority under existing Virginia case law to consider the merits to inform its judgment as to whether the appeal could be... the lateness of the appeal could be excused.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.839" offset="586377">It is on this basis that we submit one must apply the Harris... Reed against Harris... or excuse me, Harris against Reed test to determine whether the decision of the Virginia Supreme Court rested on an independent state procedural ground.</text>

            <text syncTime="150.262" offset="720124">The use of the word dismissal alone is unusual based upon our examination of Virginia cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.701" offset="765891">There are several cases cited in the party's briefs in which the court has stated appeal dismissed, Federal... the merits of the claim are therefore not reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.211" offset="823883">That articulation is a clear and express statement of reliance on State law and would meet the Harris test.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.602" offset="861499">But that further statement was not made.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.304" offset="876232">In addition in this case, I think unlike, certainly unlike any of the other reported cases we have seen, the reference in the order itself to the party's submissions with respect to the merits and then the closing language of the order which states "upon consideration whereof", thereby it seems to me unambiguously referring to all of the papers submitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="229.179" offset="1035788">And that motion of the State was based solely on State procedural grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.035" offset="1063164">Now this Court in Harris adopted in essence the Michigan against Long approach to determining whether it fairly appears that the State court judgment rests on Federal grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.795" offset="1126276">And looking at this order it's difficult for me to see how it fairly appears that that State's order rests on Federal grounds rather than the State procedural bar.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.045" offset="1239230">There are at least two where the court's decision could be informed by a reference to Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.401" offset="1268696">One is the Ake kind of situation, where the court in effect makes a determination, in fact does make a determination of Federal law, determines the Federal claims to be without merit, and therefore dismisses on the State grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.978" offset="1334942">There is nothing in this order that tells us that did not happen in this case, and in fact the case of O'Brien against Socony Mobil, decided by the Virginia Supreme Court in 1967, involved an analysis of precisely that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.872" offset="1406518">The court, there examining constitutional property rights, reviewed the record and made a determination which it described as a holding, the court said held that there was no deprivation of constitutional property rights, therefore this Court need not meet, reach the question of whether the late filing default should be excused.</text>

            <label>Justice Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="370.472" offset="1600973">And the notice of appeal precedes by some 60 days the date when the petition for the appeal is due.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.478" offset="1636918">And those... the cases you cite in your brief refer to petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.346" offset="1652382">But the notice is jurisdictional.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_wesley_hall_jr" startTime="385.482" stopTime="456.561">
            <label>Mr. John Wesley Hall, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="385.482" offset="1660950">I don't believe, Justice Kennedy, that that notion, that distinction between jurisdiction and a mandatory rule is sustainable under Virginia practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.939" offset="1710792">As I understand the practice, there is a statutory requirement that petitions be filed within 4 months of the date that triggers the need to perfect an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.317" offset="1776307">There is a court rule without a statutory basis, a court rule which is deemed mandatory, which is called mandatory, but nonetheless it is a court rule which sets the time for the filing of the notice of appeal, and that's Rule 5.9, which is referred to in the party's cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.962" offset="1854883">So although I would agree generally with the proposition that one thinks of a notice of appeal as a jurisdictional event and the timely filing of briefs or doing other things to perfect the appeal as being different in character and perhaps things which courts more typically will extend the time on, I don't believe that the Virginia practice supports that specifically.</text>

            <text syncTime="474.022" offset="2015171">The closest I come to that is Socony, and the analysis of Socony.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.676" offset="2037741">Now, there are other Virginia Supreme Court cases in which the Virginia Supreme Court indicates that it has authority to at least modify the perfection portion of the rules so that it would be in a position to allow a petitioner to file a late brief or petition on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.664" offset="2169711">But there is not a case that specifically holds that the court has authority with respect to a late notice, but it is a court-made rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.753" offset="2202103">This is not a statutory requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.955" offset="2214851">The best evidence, I submit, is the actual practice of the Virginia Supreme Court in this case, because what we have here is the State taking the position that the appeal is late, therefore there is nothing to do but dismiss the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.434" offset="2284755">And they make that motion to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.434" offset="2292800">In opposition, in opposition the petitioner makes out the case that there is room.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.273" offset="2324147">Instead of deciding that motion to dismiss on a preliminary basis, the court takes merits briefs and takes 4 months with the merits briefs, and then enters an order which refers to all the papers and doesn't clarify the basis for the ruling.</text>

            <text syncTime="643.699" offset="2693832">That is what happened in Ake, although Ake is not a summary order case so that one could go to State law and one could find a clearer answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.673" offset="2733747">One can't do that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.709" offset="2741897">I agree with that, but this order on its face does advert to the Federal merits, to the briefs dealing with the Federal merits, and the practice of the Virginia Supreme Court has been to, in some cases, not in all cases... this is not something that happens in every case and we cannot sustain that argument... but in some cases it has done this.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.424" offset="2840745">It has recognized its jurisdiction to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.942" offset="2850776">And under Harris, given this record, the court, to make clear that Federal jurisdiction is going to, not going to obtain, is required to give a clear and express statement of reliance on State law, which it doesn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="739.946" offset="3078877">That plain error analysis is a harder case than the kind of case that is set out in O'Brien against Socony, because often the plain error, and typically the plain error analysis involves an assumption that the Federal grounds have validity, and then an inquiry is made into State law, on a State law basis to determine whether there is prejudice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1222.191" offset="5007863">I'd like to proceed, because I think there's some logic to do it, to the third one before the second one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.430" offset="5036807">And that is the question of a continued viability of Fay against Noia in connection with surrenders of rights to an entire line of proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.058" offset="5103262">There's a difference between this case and the Fay against Noia kind of surrender, in that the Fay, that Noia's surrender was of direct appeal rights which barred him from collateral review, which barred him from Federal court, absent the decision of this Court to allow him to enter Federal court because that was not a procedural by-pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.857" offset="5202423">But we submit that this distinction is not one... first it's not one that has yet been resolved by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.761" offset="5226142">It was expressly left open in Wainwright against Sykes, referred to again as open in Murray against Carrier, and the logic of Sykes for determining the areas where Noia presented problems and therefore was leading to various kinds of mischief with respect to defaults, but that doesn't apply in this kind of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.430" offset="5348813">And there are basically four factors that one looks at in looking at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.565" offset="5365323">First is comity, and the question is whether State rules ought to be given their just desserts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.238" offset="5396043">And there's no question here that this is a State... if there is a default, this is a State rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.273" offset="5416105">It's, the State is entitled to have rules, and one really can't quarrel with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.343" offset="5436376">But when you look down to questions of finality accuracy and the integrity of the trial itself, the concerns that led to Sykes are quite attenuated, if indeed they exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.036" offset="5495203">On the question of finality, the finality that we're upsetting here, that we're worried about, is not really the trial court finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.459" offset="5528849">It's the finality of a decision to bar State collateral review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.279" offset="5552150">The State has already permitted an extended period for the review of its criminal convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.767" offset="5582139">The fact that a Federal court can look through that default does not really extend the period insofar as it relates to the finality of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.776" offset="5634175">Now it does, at least potentially, and maybe this case attests to it, stretch out the time between the final decision in the Federal courts and the date on which the trial was commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.000" offset="5687047">But the finality determination of the State court on State habeas is really the thing that ought to be the focus of inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1565.129" offset="6379605">We're asking the Court to affirm in this case because essentially what you have here is a case where there is no question as to the petitioner's guilt, there is no question that his offense is one that amply supports his death sentence, and there is no colorable argument here that refusing him further Federal review of his defaulted claims would constitute a miscarriage of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.994" offset="6475004">We're asking the Court to keep faith with the reasoning of its previous procedural default cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.898" offset="6498619">The Court has always struck the proper balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.767" offset="6514083">The Court has always expressed confidence in the ability of the cause and prejudice standard to avoid miscarriages of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.289" offset="6544177">And in our view the confidence has been fully warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.341" offset="6560372">But the Court has also established a safety valve exception, a miscarriage of justice exception to the cause requirement, for the extraordinary case where the defaulted claim is accompanied by a substantial showing of actual innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.468" offset="6632888">But an important point needs to be made about what the Court has said a miscarriage of justice is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.604" offset="6653473">A miscarriage of justice doesn't occur merely because a prisoner defaults a claim that he could have received relief on if he had preserved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.043" offset="6691194">A miscarriage of justice occurs only when an actually innocent prisoner finds himself in that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.364" offset="6720555">Now in this case there are very good reasons why the Court should not be concerned about Coleman's inability to establish cause for his default.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.069" offset="6759321">But you don't have to take my word for it, you can look at and listen to what the lower Federal courts in this case have said and done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.158" offset="6787638">The Fourth Circuit in this case has already conducted the safety valve exception review, has determined that he has not made a showing of actual innocence, and has determined that the miscarriage of justice exception doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.851" offset="6854407">And in view of the DNA testing which Coleman himself has conducted, at his insistence by his own expert, that--</text>

            <text syncTime="2305.099" offset="9339488">Because what he is asking for in this case is nothing short of the practical equivalent of exactly what Finley and Giarratano say is not required, the effective assistance of habeas counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.259" offset="9392046">And while he pays lip service to those precedents, what he is actually trying to do is make an end run around them by arguing that well, yes, I don't have a constitutional right to counsel, but if the States want to enforce their default rules in those proceedings, which he concedes are legitimate, if they want to enforce the default rules and if they want to have them respected by the Federal courts, then they must provide the effective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.540" offset="9489221">And if there was ever any doubt that that's what his position is, his reply brief dispelled it, because that's exactly what he says he is looking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.146" offset="9523599">And if that argument were correct, then in practical terms the decisions in Finley and Giarratano would be very hollow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.467" offset="9552960">But it's not correct, because what the Constitution doesn't require of the States at the front door can't be required of the States by going through the back door.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.942" offset="9598831">Not only would accepting his definition of cause overrule Finley and Giarratano for all practical purposes, but it would also produce adverse consequences which our system just couldn't bear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.182" offset="9647732">And in practical terms, the very real question in this case is whether the Court is going to authorize an entirely... another layer of review on top of everything we now have, a layer of review devoted to litigating the effectiveness of habeas counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.031" offset="9735190">If the Court were to recognize that an error by a habeas attorney could constitute cause, then no doubt what you would end up with is a system of collateral review where each layer of habeas counsel would say that the last habeas counsel had been ineffective.</text>

            <text syncTime="2586.680" offset="10465783">Well, Justice Stevens, I think that Carrier decided that in terms of the costs to the interest that we're concerned about, finality, comity, and federalism, the costs are the same regardless of whether the error is based on a tactical decision, inadvertence, negligence, whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.111" offset="10551465">The result to the State's interest are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.296" offset="10560242">The State has avowed interest in enforcing its default rules, in defining its appellate jurisdiction with some certainly as to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.069" offset="10595350">It has an interest in taking seriously its responsibility to being the court in the first instance to deal with constitutional error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.655" offset="10625652">And it has an interest in, if a retrial is to be granted in the case, to have it occur as proximate to the offense as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.411" offset="10656686">All three of those interests apply here, and they would, none of them would be protected under the test that Mr. Coleman is advocating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.684" offset="10697750">The only way to protect those interests is the balancing of those interests in the context of the cause and prejudice standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.290" offset="10728157">The... if the Court were ever to say that habeas attorney error was cause, something that the Court would also have to consider and would almost certainly have to grant would be a similar form of cause for pro se habeas petitioners, who make up the great bulk of habeas corpus litigants, some similar form of cause based on their alleged ineffectiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.059" offset="10843305">And I don't think it takes a whole lot of imagination to foresee all the endless variation of that type of claim, or a lot of foresight to realize that that's a can of worms that the Court should do everything possible to avoid opening.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.819" offset="10906312">In Harris v. Reed I came across the statistics for the number of Federal habeas petitions filed by State prisoners, and if you update the statistics you see that the numbers are still growing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2719.934" offset="10998786">But the point I'm making is if the Court endorses Coleman's definition of cause, whether you relate it to the appeal, or individual claims, or at the habeas trial level, or what, you can just imagine how those figures are going to explode if every habeas petitioner whose case is now at an end could go back and file another petition based upon his own alleged ineffectiveness or the alleged ineffectiveness of himself, of his writ writer, or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.940" offset="11142772">In conclusion, again we ask the Court to affirm the Fourth Circuit's decision in this case because there is no question as to the petitioner's guilt, there is no question as to the sufficiency of his offense to support a death sentence, and because in this case there is no danger that denying him further Federal review would result in a miscarriage of justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2847.033" offset="11507128">It states petitions for appeal must be presented within 4 months following final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.454" offset="11532833">That rule is jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.425" offset="11552790">It refers to the filing of a notice of appeal within 30 days after the entry of final judgment.</text>
