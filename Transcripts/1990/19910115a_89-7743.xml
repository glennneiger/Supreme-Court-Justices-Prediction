            <text syncTime="11.622" offset="181585">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.074" offset="191408">The issue in this case is whether Batson v. Kentucky applies in civil cases in the United States district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.228" offset="216067">More specifically, the question before you today is whether, in a case in which a black man is a litigant, counsel for his opponent can use his statutorily granted peremptory challenges to remove blacks from the jury panel without any question or without any interference from the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.023" offset="279283">We contend that he cannot, and we suggest three reasons why such a practice is inconsistent with the dictates of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.493" offset="309063">One is constitutional based upon an equal protection analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.779" offset="322229">The other two are nonconstitutional issues, one statutory and one based upon the supervisory power of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.151" offset="351695">At the outset, this Court should note the conflict among the circuit courts of appeals which now exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.455" offset="376981">As recently as last month, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, in a case called Dunham v. Frank's Nursery and Crafts, which is cited in the reply brief, ruled in a case on all fours with the case before you today that Batson does apply in civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.548" offset="433301">Prior to that ruling, the Eleventh Circuit had reached the same result in a case in which certiorari was denied by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.202" offset="459946">The Eighth Circuit has ruled that with respect to a governmental litigant the Batson rule does apply and does extend to civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.772" offset="486278">That case now awaits action by this Court on a petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.741" offset="498085">In this particular case, the plaintiff filed suit as a result of injuries that he sustained while he was working on a United States Army base.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.097" offset="531522">The case was tried to a jury selected from a venire compiled in accordance with Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.233" offset="552106">The panel of 12 was ultimately chosen from 18 who were selected to sit in the box.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.869" offset="570601">Of that number... of the 18, that is... 3 were members of the black race.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.189" offset="587946">Voir dire was conducted by the trial judge, and at its conclusion, the judge and counsel retired to the judge's chambers to exercise their peremptory challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.279" offset="624204">At that point, counsel for the respondent exercised two of his three challenges against black jurors.</text>

            <label>Mr. James E. Doyle</label>
            <text syncTime="168.676" offset="809883">Well, the peremptory challenges were made known in chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.295" offset="824302">The effect of the challenges, that is, the excuse to the jury, was done in open court after the court reconvened.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.199" offset="855963">At the point at which the challenges were exercised by the respondent, I did object and cited the court to Batson v. Kentucky and argued that in that particular case, since there was a black litigant and since counsel for the respondent had exercise two of his statutorily granted strikes against members of the black race, that the equal protection basis of Batson was implicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.528" offset="937256">The judge overruled my objection, refused to allow... or refused to require, rather, the counsel for the respondent to voice a racially neutral reason for the objections or for the challenges that he had made and the case went back into the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.122" offset="991590">At that stage, the judge then called the jury back in the box, announced which jurors were being excused.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.192" offset="1015936">Those jurors left the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.409" offset="1024818">The objection was once again raised to the court in open court, outside the jury's presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.930" offset="1042895">It was once again overruled, and the case proceeded to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.382" offset="1060658">We believe that Batson made clear... this Court's opinion in Batson made clear that the Constitution prohibits all forms of purposeful racial discrimination in jury selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.856" offset="1106529">The first panel, hearing this challenge in the court of appeals for the Fifth Circuit, agreed and ruled 2 to 1 for that proposition, extending Batson to this particular civil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.311" offset="1148430">But on en banc rehearing, that decision was reversed and the court ruled that equal protection was not implicated because of the absence of State action.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.067" offset="1183434">We contend that the fundamental error that the trial court made and the fundamental error made by the court of appeals sitting en banc was in not recognizing that Batson was... should be extended to civil cases, and in refusing to require the judge to conduct the hearing which Batson would mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.946" offset="1250934">The fact that that hearing was not conducted in this case requires a reversal and a remand so that the hearing can be conducted to determine whether the challenges were racially exercised or exercised for some other reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.038" offset="1303283">The first argument that we will address the Court's attention to is the constitutional argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.240" offset="1324077">Any trial in a Federal courtroom is a public function, whether it's civil or criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.311" offset="1344348">It takes place on Government property, presided over by a Federal officer in the case of jury trials by using citizens who are pulled compulsory... with the compulsory process of the Federal courts in to the courtroom, who are sworn as officers of the court, for that purpose to render a decision in the dispute among the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.392" offset="1420730">Those jurors are selected in accordance with Federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.094" offset="1435568">They are summoned by having their names first placed on a jury wheel, which is made up by Federal officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.330" offset="1460436">They are paid with Government funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.282" offset="1468273">And they're protected by the same statute from force and intimidation which applies to the Federal judge who sits on the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1056.854" offset="4362536">The analysis which was made of what the underlying court of appeal had done there contained this phrase which this Court believed was a more restrictive test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.143" offset="4395763">A private party acts under color of State law when there is a surrender of judicial power to the private litigant in such a way that the independence of the enforcing officer has been compromised to a significant degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.451" offset="4444978">Now, that more restrictive view was not adopted by the Court in Lugar, but it's particularly appropriate to look at here because if the judge is the enforcing officer of the right, it's hard to imagine more restrictions that could be placed on him than to say, as the respondent in the en banc majority did, that he has no discretion, that he can do nothing else but excuse the juror.</text>

            <text syncTime="1557.311" offset="6364351">But for a black man or woman in Louisiana the right to serve as a juror is as new and a... as great an honor as the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.749" offset="6394131">Mr. Combs' parents and his grandparents could not have served on the jury in Louisiana, not because they weren't fit or qualified or competent to do it, but because they would not be allowed to do so because of the color of their skin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.707" offset="6438016">On that July day in 1987, Willie Combs and Wilton Simmons entered the Federal courthouse in Lake Charles, Louisiana, believing that times had changed.</text>

            <label>Mr. John S. Baker, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1603.607" offset="6549612">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.076" offset="6563404">This Court should affirm the en banc decision of the Fifth Circuit basically for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.647" offset="6585765">First of all, there has been no showing of State action in this case which is absolutely essential for any equal protection claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.653" offset="6617739">And secondly, unless the congressional statute is unconstitutional, it should be given effect as written.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.711" offset="6661938">Mr. Doyle has raised, but not been able to argue, other issues that are non-constitutional in origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.329" offset="6684508">These issues were not raised in the lower courts, and I suggested before and I think I should emphasize again that the reason these issues are being raised now is because of the difficulty of the hurdle of State action in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.006" offset="6739156">And while Mr. Doyle has said that he was not raising a cross-section challenge or he was not raising a Seventh Amendment argument, the fact of the matter is that his argument runs together the issues under the Equal Protection Clause and the issues that have been raised previously and rejected by this Court under other amendments to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.836" offset="6822434">Under State action, few would normally think that the actions of a private attorney in the course of litigation within the courtroom constitutes State action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.227" offset="6868096">In this case, however, there has been the development of the argument that the actions of the attorney constitute State action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.034" offset="6911251">But the extent to which there is the expansion of State action as a concept, I think is reflected by Mr. Doyle's discussion of jurors as governmental actors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.794" offset="6970288">There is, as we know, the potential within some of the State action cases to expand it to the point where virtually anything and everything is State action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.685" offset="7021905">It is true that an attorney is an officer of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.987" offset="7035071">But as previously mentioned, Polk County, involving a public defender, was fairly clear that normally the actions of a public defender within the courtroom do not constitute State action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.663" offset="7089824">So insofar as we are looking at the private attorney in the courtroom, you wouldn't normally find State action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.717" offset="7118036">And I think it was the weakness in that argument--</text>

            <text syncTime="1755.206" offset="7155966">And that's why we have to focus on exactly what the issue is here and that's where I was going to next, where we have the invocation, especially in the Eleventh Circuit opinion by Judge Wisdom, which focuses not on the action of the attorney but focuses on the action of the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.320" offset="7232452">That is because of the inherent weakness of focusing on the attorney as the sole point for identifying State action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1809.993" offset="7375081">It seems to me there's a very close parallel between that case and a case where, as a matter of custom and practice and State law, and in this case Federal law, peremptory challenges are used by the attorneys who are, quote, "in a private capacity" in order to make a determination that has official consequences.</text>

            <text syncTime="1833.942" offset="7470898">--I think that in all of the State action cases, Your Honor, there is always this problem of identifying what the actual actor is actually doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.648" offset="7509768">Now, in a number of cases where the action is one that is itself is normally conducted by the State, which is assigned, delegated, controlled, dictated, or anything else, where there is some kind of a relationship between the State and the actor, not merely by way of physical connection, but by way of something that is intentional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.865" offset="7606630">And if you're conducting a function of a state... of the state that is otherwise conducted in an election... if you are conducting a function that is delegated by statute, that is coerced, that is directed, then the cases have in fact attributed that kind of action to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.577" offset="7685416">Now, that's not the situation here when the judges... when the judge in his capacity is involved in the--</text>

            <text syncTime="1896.816" offset="7722405">In this case, unlike Terry v. Adams, the State has acted in order to cull the jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.252" offset="7744139">The State has, from a chronological standpoint, begun its formal processes even before the attorney's peremptory challenge is exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.310" offset="7784368">So this in a way is even an easier case than Terry v. Adams, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1915.679" offset="7797847">--Well, I don't think it is in the context of your own decisions regarding the whole line of cases on jury discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.083" offset="7823447">First of all, until Batson, there was a very clear line between the venire cases and the petit jury case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.320" offset="7852390">Now, Batson changes that line, certainly at least as to the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.474" offset="7869004">And we are talking about prosecutorial action within the petit jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.092" offset="7887499">But the Court came back in Holland v. Illinois and made it very clear that the standards that control, generally in the venire cases, do not, therefore, necessarily carry over to bring the cross-section standards and other things into the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.237" offset="7956044">So we have to focus on exactly what is being done here by the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.208" offset="7976002">The judge is, at this point... what is he doing?</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.910" offset="7990735">The judge is a State actor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.060" offset="7995332">There's no doubt about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.612" offset="8001602">But it's not his action that's in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.564" offset="8013409">The action in question is the decision by the attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.468" offset="8033053">The judge is not telling the attorney what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.002" offset="8047159">The attorney is acting under a statute... a Federal statute... which is neutral on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.423" offset="8068789">The Federal statute gives the trial judge no discretion in regard to the exercise at least of the three peremptories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.096" offset="8103479">The judge is not involved in making any kind of a judgment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.214" offset="8119989">The attorneys are not acting on his direction or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.350" offset="8136498">What is really at stake... what the real quarrel is with is not with the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.087" offset="8155515">It is with the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.189" offset="8163874">It is with allowing the peremptories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.741" offset="8178085">But there hasn't really been a direct frontal attack on the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.795" offset="8198356">If you look at Judge Rubin's dissent for instance in the en banc opinion, he says, nevertheless, if not constrained by Batson, the rules governing peremptory strikes vest absolute discretion in the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.769" offset="8254258">The State thereby guarantees the effect of an objection to seating an otherwise eligible juror by allowing no other to object.</text>

            <text syncTime="2746.819" offset="11122399">All I'm trying to do at this point is to get and make very clear that this is not State action and those elements from a few cases that suggest that a judge's minor involvement constitutes State action, require, it seems to me, a distinction between the judge and what the judge is actually doing on... at a particular moment and whether that action is, quote, "fairly attributable" to him, as we say under the standard in Lugar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.088" offset="11243502">And I don't think it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.373" offset="11248622">And the difference between this kind of a situation and the prosecutor, it seems to me, is great.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.194" offset="11279865">The... fundamentally, when you are talking about the prosecutor, who is clearly a State actor, and therefore, this Court didn't have to address that problem in Batson, you have someone who, historically, as shown in a series of cases, an effect that this Court took judicial notice of, had engaged in a course of conduct.</text>
