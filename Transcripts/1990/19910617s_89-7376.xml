            <text syncTime="8.633" offset="108440">The petitioner in this case, Pearly Wilson, is a prison inmate in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.667" offset="136547">He sued the respondents, who are prison officials, alleging that certain conditions of his confinement constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.947" offset="177716">The District Court granted summary judgment for the prison officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.447" offset="191718">The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, concluding that Wilson's affidavits failed to establish the requisite culpable state of mind on the part of the officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.101" offset="238320">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we agree with the Sixth Circuit that an inmate claiming that prison conditions violate the Eighth Amendment must show a culpable state of mind on the part of the officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.702" offset="288685">This requirement is implicit in that Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.473" offset="311777">The Sixth Circuit, however, appears to have applied an overly exacting intense standard, stating that the official's conduct must be marked by "persistent malicious cruelty."</text>
            <text syncTime="72.213" offset="362768">The appropriate standard is the one we have long applied to prisoner claims involving medical care, namely deliberate indifference.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.166" offset="390562">We vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for reconsideration under that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.170" offset="414595">Justice White has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justices Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens have joined.</text>
