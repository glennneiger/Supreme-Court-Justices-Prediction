            <label>Mr. Peter S. Sheldon</label>
            <text syncTime="11.520" offset="169697">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.073" offset="195819">This case involves the constitutionality of a value-added tax, specifically the Michigan Single Business Tax, which is known more commonly as the SBT.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.151" offset="248169">The case comes to this Court on stipulated facts from a decision of the Michigan Supreme Court that upheld the tax against petitioner's constitutional challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.327" offset="288920">There are two questions presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.941" offset="299369">The first question is whether the three-factor property payroll and sale apportionment formula that is contained in the SBT taxes value added outside of Michigan and produces a grossly distorted result in violation of the Due Process and Commerce Clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.702" offset="378363">The second question is whether that same three-factor apportionment formula discriminates in favor of in-State businesses and against petitioner and other similarly situated out-of-State businesses by systematically and irrationally reducing the tax bases of the former, while systematically and irrationally increasing the tax bases of the latter.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.001" offset="479614">The primary points we make are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.313" offset="492779">First, the tax base of the SBT, like the tax base of all value-added taxes, consists primarily of site-specific components, and those site-specific components, principally compensation and depreciation, are readily susceptible to precise identification and allocation on a State-by-State basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.551" offset="605733">They are site specific because you know where the labor is performed, and therefore where value added by the labor takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.359" offset="648992">You know where the depreciable plant is located, and therefore where value added by depreciable plant takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.823" offset="678876">For the average SBT taxpayer the record in this case shows that its tax base consists of compensation to the extent of 77 percent, capital to the extent of another 17 percent, and profit to a much lesser extent, only about 6 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.609" offset="769991">So you can see the site-specific components dominate.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.001" offset="787545">And for Trinova, the petitioner in this case, those site-specific components are even more dominant, because here also the record clearly shows by stipulation that Trinova's tax base consisted of compensation to the extent of 102 percent, depreciation to the extent of another 11 percent, and profit, profit added not 1 cent of positive contribution to the value-added tax base.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.734" offset="922546">And that is because Trinova, during the 1980 tax year that is at issue here, incurred a significant loss from its operations.</text>

            <label>Justice Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="207.871" offset="955042">Suppose the facts were different and profit produced the greatest factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.997" offset="983568">Would the operation of the tax violate the Constitution as applied?</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter S. Sheldon</label>
            <text syncTime="219.361" offset="1001018">Perhaps not, Your Honor, if... if Trinova had had a tax base that was comprised of the profit component to a significant extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.048" offset="1055770">But in this case the contribution of profit to the value-added tax base component was zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.213" offset="1080430">In fact it was a negative contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.456" offset="1089416">Now because these site-specific components are susceptible to allocation, there is no need to apportion that.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.604" offset="1129958">May I interrupt to... to follow up on Justice Blackmun's question?</text>
            <text syncTime="255.647" offset="1146154">Is there an agreement between the adversaries in this case that in the general... throughout the general run of taxpayers that the site-specific components is around 90 percent?</text>

            <text syncTime="266.394" offset="1189099">It's not a matter of stipulation, Justice Stevens, but in the merits brief, appendix la contains a publication from the Department of Treasury that clearly sets forth for the average taxpayer what their components of tax base are.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.346" offset="1256913">And there, very clearly, the compensation component is dominant and constitutes approximately 77 percent of the average taxpayer's tax base.</text>

            <text syncTime="292.462" offset="1293380">Mr. Sheldon, let me put this question in terms of one of the examples given in one of the briefs taken from a law review article, as I recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.280" offset="1340714">The statement was made that a tax upon... upon sleeping, measured by the number of shoes in your closet, is in fact a tax upon shoes.</text>

            <text syncTime="317.410" offset="1393168">The point, Justice Scalia, is that a tax has to be analyzed, in testing its constitutionality under the Due Process and Commerce Clauses, in terms of its practical effect, in terms of its economic reality.</text>

            <text syncTime="1281.384" offset="5249050">And the value added by the depreciation contribution to the capital component is fairly reflected in the property factor alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.338" offset="5288966">Those are the dominant parts of the SBT tax base.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.413" offset="5309237">Statistics tell us so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.755" offset="5314566">77 percent of the average SBT taxpayer's tax base is not income, it is compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.541" offset="5337762">Because of that, when you throw into the mix an equally-weighted sales factor, you are adding to the mix in terms of assigning those values to Michigan something that is irrelevant and something that is going to cause distortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.602" offset="5413935">Because again, sales activity provides no rational clue whatsoever as to where the value-adding activity that underlies the payments of compensation and depreciation take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.603" offset="5469942">In addition and independent of the gross distortion that this tax generates, it also produces a discriminatory effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.863" offset="5535039">And here again the culprit is the sales factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.877" offset="5551026">For those labor-intensive businesses that have property and payroll factors which when averaged are greater than their sales factor, this formula will enable them to export out of Michigan some of their site-specific, value-adding activity, while for the labor intensive business that has property and payroll factors which when averaged are less than their sales factor, they will be forced to import into Michigan some part of their site-specific value-adding activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.325" offset="5728868">And what this means, what this means is that the out-of-State taxpayer that has the characteristics I have just described will pay more tax on its Michigan value-adding activity than will the in-State taxpayer that has the characteristics that I have just described.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.311" offset="5828760">And while that difference in tax responsibility is admittedly not the result of the application of different tax rates or varying exemptions or varying credits, nonetheless, the practical effect of the tax is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.751" offset="5898559">And it serves to provide a direct commercial advantage, and an unfair one, to the in-staters, and it serves as well to exert impermissibly on out-of-State taxpayers the possibility and the inducement to make non tax-neutral decisions to locate their property and their work force in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.659" offset="5998242">If I... if the Court doesn't have any additional questions at this time I would like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2207.045" offset="8951751">The discrimination argument hinges completely upon acceptance of the requirement of separate accounting for this type of a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.151" offset="8988218">If no separate accounting is required, then obviously the Michigan... there is no discrimination, because the out-of-State industry cannot show that the out-of-State industry is burdened more than in-State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.779" offset="9042657">The other coin... the other coin that we have here is the alternative argument, which presupposes a two-factor formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.927" offset="9091245">A two-factor formula ends up, as noted on page 44 of our brief, with a tax of $5,199 for doing a business resulting in over $104 million of revenue to the State... to Trinova.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.259" offset="9156551">Now, this $5,199 on top of it would never change, because it is only property and payroll, whether Trinova sold $100, $1 million, or $100 million in this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.038" offset="9211721">Now such a two-factor formula in my estimation would really... it may pass constitutional muster, but would not really reflect any kind of business activity, because I believe that the social costs generated by sales of $100 million, just the use of the courts, the highways, the schools, are much greater than the social costs generated by a sale of $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.390" offset="9301165">And yet the two-factor formula would lead to that particular result.</text>

            <text syncTime="2639.974" offset="10683460">Well, why did you adopt this new... this scheme replaced something else, like an income tax.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard R. Roesch</label>
            <text syncTime="2645.298" offset="10704776">--Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.060" offset="10707806">Our income tax in Michigan was... was unpredictably cyclical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.214" offset="10728391">There were years in which Michigan got practically no income from its corporate income tax, and then boom years it got a lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.868" offset="10759006">It also replaced the net worth tax in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.742" offset="10774575">That was the only stable tax that we had in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.566" offset="10785860">It replaced a tax... but that tax was disliked by the, by all the business community, in State and out State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.298" offset="10812714">It also displaced a tax upon intangibles, mainly accounts receivable for the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.946" offset="10847300">And finally a tax upon their business inventories, which was a property tax, which is really an anachronism because most States have repealed their personal property taxes, particularly upon inventories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.294" offset="10896724">Now this was also a tax simplification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.447" offset="10909367">Instead of having to deal with all of these taxes, the taxpayer now had to deal only with one tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.272" offset="10936639">This tax would be more... much more stable, because... like a gross receipts tax would be extremely stable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.037" offset="10967673">And so anything that is a modified gross receipts tax, which you can view this SBT as a modified gross receipts tax, also is much more stable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.175" offset="11016260">It is not subject to fluctuations that base, like income, is subject to fluctuations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.720" offset="11042487">It was hoped that because of simpler tax simplification, also because the businessman could more closely forecast his tax liability, that this would in itself be greatly attractive to industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.503" offset="11109570">But there was no design to try... in the Single Business Tax, to bring business into the State, to, in the words of Westinghouse v. Tully, to exert an inexorable hydraulic pressure to have business performed in the State rather than out of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.788" offset="11202670">Quite to the contrary, if Michigan had done that it probably would have adopted a flat sales factor the way Iowa has, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.293" offset="11244779">That would really have... that really would have been an encouragement to perform in the State and sell out of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.798" offset="11270797">And yet this Court upheld in Moorman the single factor sales formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.316" offset="11304861">Now, ultimately what this case boils down to is that while Trinova admits that separate geographic accounting is not permissible for an income tax, that it should be constitutionally required when we have other than an income tax, that if we have a tax like Michigan which can be viewed as either an income augmented by cost tax, modified gross receipts tax, or, as the Michigan court puts it, a tax upon the value added to products and services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.089" offset="11459924">Now, Trinova's separate accounting argument really results in converting an admitted value added, an admitted tax base of $221 million, into a Michigan loss of $2 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.483" offset="11537455">Trinova pays no Michigan tax for the privilege of doing $104 million worth of business in the State of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.716" offset="11566399">That is the consequence of the separate accounting argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.638" offset="11578102">In Butler Brothers v. McColgan the Court was faced with the same idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.723" offset="11598477">It was faced also once again with that idea in Exxon v. Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.537" offset="11621674">And in each one of these cases the Court flatly disallowed converting a preapportionment tax base positive into a negative loss within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.385" offset="11669113">Realizing that the separate accounting theory might not be accepted, Trinova evolved a secondary argument which is inconsistent with its separate accounting theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.023" offset="11723656">It evolved the argument yes, maybe apportionment is proper for our value added.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.618" offset="11746017">But they say it should only be apportioned by a two-factor formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.711" offset="11762422">But as I noted before, and as explained on page 44 of the State's brief, such a two-factor formula would produce exactly the same amount of tax whether or not there was any substantial sales activity in Michigan by Trinova, whether they sold $1,000, $1 million, or $100 million worth of sales in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.756" offset="11854582">In Complete Auto Transit, in Complete Auto Transit this Court tried to get away from looking to the labels of a tax and said we are going to look at a practical effect of this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.947" offset="11923336">And yet the whole argument here is on labels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.391" offset="11941099">It is admitted that if Michigan imposed a straightforward income tax it could use the three-factor formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.757" offset="11970566">If it imposed a gross receipts tax, sure it could use a three-factor formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.932" offset="11991255">A net worth tax, as it did impose previously, a three-factor formula may be applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="3158.767" offset="12758628">Just because a business is a unitary business does not mean that the tax bases of every tax to which it may be subject must be apportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.359" offset="12828949">I don't think anyone will argue that a real property tax, or a tax on immobile tangible personal property, or a severance tax that is imposed against a business has to be apportioned just because the business is a unitary business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.041" offset="12903764">Here the practical effect of this tax is not a tax on business activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.536" offset="12929677">That is merely the legal justification, the legal excuse, if you will, for Michigan to be able to impose a tax against those businesses that are conducting business in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.775" offset="12978683">The practical effect of the tax is that for most taxpayers it is a tax on compensation, and a tax on compensation is like a tax on payroll.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.591" offset="13017971">And a tax on payroll is, in practical effect, no different than a tax on real property, or on immobile tangible personal property, or a severance tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.269" offset="13072619">And like those taxes, it too should not be subjected to apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.263" offset="13088606">You need not apportion it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.785" offset="13094667">Amerada Hess, the point is made that this Court said in Amerada Hess that the cost of unitary business and whether those costs are or are not site specific is irrelevant in determining their contribution to an income tax base.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.781" offset="13190693">But Amerada Hess involved a New Jersey statute, a taxing statute that was clearly an income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.644" offset="13218174">It wasn't even close to what the Michigan SBT is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.707" offset="13234370">Even after you denied the deduction for the windfall profit tax deduction, what was left of the New Jersey tax was plainly an income tax measured by Federal taxable income with just the one deduct taken away for windfall profit tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.080" offset="13315872">Here we have a value-added tax where 90 percent of the tax base, over 90 percent consists of site-specific components, principally compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.078" offset="13359862">The point is Amerada Hess does not stand for the proposition that site-specific components of a value-added tax base have to be apportioned, or that their site specificity is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.168" offset="13424228">Counsel claims that, look, Trinova had $104 million of sales in Michigan this year, during the 1980 year, and the SBT as applied to it exacted a tax that amounted to 3/10 of 1 percent of its sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.822" offset="13510850">So what has Trinova to argue about?</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.574" offset="13521821">Well, what Trinova has to argue about is that this tax is not a gross receipts tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.770" offset="13550660">It's a tax on value added.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.692" offset="13562363">Appendix 3a of our merits brief clearly discloses that the gross receipts alternative is only available to a small fraction of Michigan taxpayers, less than 10 percent use this gross receipts alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.910" offset="13623176">So in practical effect we're not talking about a gross receipts tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.423" offset="13637282">We're talking about a value-added tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.176" offset="13652224">And the only way, the only way Michigan can exact 1 cent of tax from Trinova is to tax its extraterritorial value, the value that it has added to the contributions of its labor and its capital outside of Michigan.</text>
