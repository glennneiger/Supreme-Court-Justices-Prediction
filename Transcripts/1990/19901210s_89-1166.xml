            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73981">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No. 89-1166, Groves versus Ring Screw Works.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.944" offset="105746">In this case, the petitioners were discharged from their jobs and they claimed that the discharge has violated their collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.840" offset="141272">These agreements contained a voluntary grievance procedure, but the agreement said nothing about possible judicial remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.469" offset="171783">The question presented by this case is whether if these grievance procedures are unsuccessful, the contract should be construed to bar recourse to the court under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.030" offset="230089">In this case, the procedures fail to resolve the parties' dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.212" offset="246807">And after the company had decided not to request arbitration and the Union had decided not to strike, the petitioners filed this action invoking the Federal Court jurisdiction under Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.555" offset="300201">In an opinion authored by Justice Stevens and filed with the Clerk today, we conclude that petitioners are not precluded from pursuing the judicial remedy because the collective bargaining agreements did not explicitly foreclose such a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.007" offset="357984">The parties are free to decide the means by which to resolve their dispute, and such means can include economic sanction such as strikes or lockouts.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.014" offset="394033">Where the parties have failed to specify the method of their final resolution in the collective bargaining agreement, we will not construe those agreements as such silence in effect to foreclose access to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.784" offset="445024">Our opinion in this case is unanimous.</text>
