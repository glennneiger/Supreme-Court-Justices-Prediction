            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73987">The opinion of the Court in No. 89-1027, Norfolk &amp; Western Railway versus American Train Dispatchers' Association will be announced by Justice Kennedy.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="11.892" offset="121530">These are consolidated cases, which comes to us on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.069" offset="150160">They involve the Interstate Commerce Commission's authority to approve rail carrier consolidations.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.409" offset="175551">The case turns on one phrase in a federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.203" offset="194777">Under 49 U. S. C. 11341(a), a rail carrier in an ICC approved consolidation is "exempt from the antitrust laws and from all other law, including state and municipal law, as necessary to let it carryout the transaction."</text>
            <text syncTime="51.548" offset="280145">And the question here is the meaning and application of the term, "all other law".</text>
            <text syncTime="55.144" offset="294460">The cases here today involve two different railroad consolidations.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.098" offset="310343">One involves the acquisition and consolidation of Norfolk &amp; Western Railway, Co. and Southern Railway Company; and the other, involves the acquisition and consolidation of Chessie System, Inc. and Seaboard Coastline Industries, Inc., both of which are parent corporations of railroad companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.460" offset="379724">In each of those cases, the ICC approved the consolidated transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.247" offset="398950">The merge to railroads then combined in coordinated operations in the manner that required displacement of jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.101" offset="426327">The petitioners are Unions of the displaced employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.436" offset="439701">They invoked arbitration and claimed that the job displacements violated certain collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.324" offset="463211">The arbitration panels in both cases ruled for the railroad carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.181" offset="478676">The ICC affirmed the arbitration decisions reasoning that the statute here in question exempted the parties to the transaction from the obligations of the collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.701" offset="520785">The Court of Appeals reverse the ICC and remanded holding that the federal statute does not authorize the ICC to relieve a party of collective bargaining obligations even if the obligations impede implementation of an approved transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.437" offset="575643">In an opinion filed today, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.890" offset="585465">We hold that the exemption in the statute from all other law extends to a carrier's legal obligations under a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.581" offset="620260">The exemption language in the statute is clear, broad, and unqualified, manifesting an unambiguous congressional intent to exempt any obligation by law as necessary to carryout an ICC approved transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.450" offset="675744">The exemption is broad enough to override the obligations imposed by the law which make the collective bargaining agreements binding, namely the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.202" offset="706777">Our interpretation of the statute, we think, makes sense of the Interstate Commerce Act's consolidated provisions which were designed to promote efficiency in interstate transportation by removing the burdens of excessive expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.715" offset="756828">Section 11341(a) guarantees that once employee interests are accounted for in the ICC's approval of the transaction, then the Railway Labor Act whose major dispute resolution process is often interminable will not prevent the efficiencies of the consolidation from being achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.606" offset="828403">Our reading at 11341(a) does not exempt carriers from all law but rather, as the statute requires from all law necessary to carryout an approved transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.543" offset="868109">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justice Marshall joins.</text>
