            <label>Mr. J. Brooke Lathram</label>
            <text syncTime="10.959" offset="179924">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.850" offset="195493">The most prejudicial conduct in which the prosecution engaged in this case involved what I believe to be the least controversial part of Booth v. Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.887" offset="243663">I refer to Booth's condemnation of survivor opinion about the sentence that a capital defendant should receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.983" offset="280025">And I refer, in the context of this case, to the prosecutor's concluding remarks in his closing argument during the sentencing trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.603" offset="322553">In the course of that, the prosecutor, in effect, demanded that the jury impose the death sentence in order to satisfy the anticipated desire of young Nicholas Christopher for Payne's execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.851" offset="387545">It is true, of course, that in this case no witness actually took the stand and testified that they wanted Payne executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.196" offset="420878">But what happened here was much worse than that, I respectfully submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.509" offset="434148">And along that line, I think it would be a terrible mistake if we were to allow the State to avoid the consequences of calling a witness who would express such opinion by simply allowing the prosecutor to take the stand and testify for the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.621" offset="498618">In this particular case, the prosecutor, serving as the surrogate for young Nicholas Christopher, a young... youngster for whom this jury undoubtedly had the most heartfelt and deepest sympathy, serving as the representative of the State, did three improper things.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.521" offset="574164">He, first of all, demanded Payne's execution because... for young Nicholas' sake.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.318" offset="605407">Secondly, he suggested to the jury that this was a permissible basis for executing an offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.753" offset="631111">And thirdly, he engaged in a form of psychological intimidation of the worst kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.237" offset="649083">He strongly--</text>

            <text syncTime="168.032" offset="808221">I think that they certainly would take that into account, and are entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.036" offset="824208">What we say is the error here... it would have been wrong, for example, Your Honor, for the grandmother to take the stand and actually testify to the opinion, I would like to see Pervis Payne executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.003" offset="872065">By the same token, we think that the prosecutor cannot get up and start off his argument to the jury and say at the very conclusion, there is one thing, however, you can do for young Nicholas Christopher, and then go on to say that the little boy when he grows up is going to demand a particular type of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.863" offset="939565">He's going to want to know what type of justice was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.917" offset="955761">Just as it would be wrong to call a witness to the stand and say I think that the defendant should be executed, by the same token, I respectfully submit, that it's even worse, under the particular circumstances of this case, to have the prosecutor testify for the little boy.</text>

            <text syncTime="489.584" offset="2094386">I would think that society's interest in retribution is just as strong, even if one of the survivors comes in and says, I'm a very religious person and I don't believe in the death penalty and I don't want this man being executed.</text>

            <text syncTime="503.032" offset="2148199">You know one of the purposes of retribution was to prevent people from taking law into their own hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.596" offset="2170455">You go all the way back an the State's punishment simply substitutes for what used to be called "weregild", where the person doing the injury would pay money to the family of the person harmed, and things of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.226" offset="2233044">What the family of the person harmed thinks about the matter on that theory would be very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.710" offset="2262928">Certainly one of the purposes is to prevent people from taking justice into their own hands, saying the State will avenge you; you need not avenge yourselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="1342.632" offset="5506605">I believe very strongly, and I know this Court has said this, that legislatures have very substantial leeway in our form of Government to make these kinds of hard choices.</text>

            <text syncTime="1388.613" offset="5690507">Hijacking number 1, a death results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.664" offset="5698762">Hijacking number 2, because of a mere fortuity, there is no death that results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.456" offset="5717883">I think Booth would agree that the statute, because that is the Air Piracy Statute, is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.150" offset="5740662">And I certainly would accept that because, after all, we have a determination by society that the crime may be aggravated because of the harm, even though the hijacker didn't intend the harm, and the hijacker himself was not the one directly responsible for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.439" offset="5793847">Again, that is a valid exercise of retribution by our national legislature, Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.843" offset="5815477">Now, let's compare that with this hypothetical.</text>

            <text syncTime="1429.999" offset="5856123">But let's assume that in hijacking number 1, the victim who dies is a person beloved by society and leaves behind several aggrieved survivors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1450.761" offset="5939088">My concern with overruling Booth is raised by this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.196" offset="5960927">Is hijacker number 2 really less blameworthy?</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.640" offset="5982661">Is he really less deserving of death than hijacker number 1, simply because the victim was a reprobate who left no aggrieved survivors?</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.555" offset="6022262">Perhaps that's a policy question, and that's the issue, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1632.471" offset="6666024">The first is that whether or not the person is a saint or a reprobate, and whether or not the jury is told about it really isn't any more... doesn't inject anything more arbitrary than the fortuity of death resulting or not resulting, it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.942" offset="6735823">He performs certain dangerous acts; he realizes that they may cause death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.444" offset="6753900">By the same token, he realizes that if he performs them, the victim may be a saint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.779" offset="6779186">In each case, it seems to me, that it's fortuitous.</text>

            <text syncTime="1666.142" offset="6800711">Isn't the real problem with getting into the... or at least with the prosecution's taking the affirmative in getting into the character of the victim, that it implies that society is valuing victims differently?</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.875" offset="6867585">Isn't the real problem one, almost one, a kind of maybe a second-tier equality before the law argument, that society is placing different values on their victims... on victims?</text>

Gathers were wrongly decided in that they were founded on the flawed propositions that victim impact information may be unrelated to any legitimate sentencing consideration, that its inherently emotional appeal will shift the focus of the sentencer to irrelevant factors, and that in so shifting the focus of the sentencer, it will result in the arbitrary imposition of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.119" offset="7316577">It's the State's position that the full extent of harm done is relevant to the personal responsibility and moral guilt of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.603" offset="7350536">That some individual characterization of the victim is necessary to enable the sentencer to make a decision, a particularized decision, and a moral decision in the sentencing process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2941.429" offset="11901799">We urge overruling of Booth v. Maryland and South Carolina v. Gathers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.294" offset="11921234">We submit that there is nothing cruel or unusual about the jury's consideration of victim impact evidence in the sentencing stage.</text>

            <text syncTime="2978.555" offset="12050279">Victim impacts evidence should be considered in capital cases to ensure not only that the defendant is held morally responsible for the victim's death, but to hold defendant accountable for the full extent of the harm caused by his or her criminal acts.</text>
