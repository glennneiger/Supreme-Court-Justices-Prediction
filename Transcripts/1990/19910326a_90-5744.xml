            <text syncTime="673.092" offset="2821704">The first is, when the LSD is placed on the blotter paper, it bears the same relationship to the blotter paper that the cocaine does to the cutting agent, doesn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="686.080" offset="2873740">Because it's no longer possible at least without sophisticated chemical reductions to distinguish between the drug and the substance that it is associated with, whereas when you're dealing with bottles or suitcases or automobiles, that is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.551" offset="2947614">So that in that respect, the analogy between the blotter paper and the cutting agent for cocaine is in fact a legitimate analogy, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="771.997" offset="3217407">So that if you've got tubes and jars of it, you've got something which in that form simply cannot be commercially used.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.540" offset="3239559">And the only way you can commercially use it is to combine it with blotter paper or sugar cubes.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.294" offset="3262547">And in that sense, by making that combination, you do make it more broadly distributable than it would be without the combination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2098.566" offset="8523608">But that's not off by degrees of magnitude from the type of heroin you can see on the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.008" offset="8541371">We've cited in our brief different cases and in those cases they have identified the percentage amount of heroin in some of the drugs that were seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.675" offset="8572091">And that some of that percentage amount of heroin was as small as 1.2 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.977" offset="8589227">The DEA also engaged in what is called their domestic monitor program to see what the purity of different drugs is, and they purchase them on the street as a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.592" offset="8623709">And in the domestic monitor program that we pointed... cited to... the study we cited to in our brief, the purity in some cases was as low as.6 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.589" offset="8659758">And then it varied dramatically, sometimes from city to city.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.380" offset="8670938">In Baltimore, for example, 3.1 percent was the average amount of heroin found in some samples, whereas in New York it can vary up to perhaps as much as 40 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.214" offset="8706256">Plus some of the studies that were cited in the... in the books, in the amicus brief for example, said that the average amount of THC which is the active ingredient in marijuana in an average marijuana cigarette can be 1 to 5 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.694" offset="8764143">The average amount of THC which is the active ingredient in hashish, found in street-level hashish, can be 4 to 10 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.050" offset="8793609">So the dilution factor that you see in the case of LSD is not markedly different from the dilution factor you see in the case of other drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.816" offset="8820672">Now, it's also doubtless the case that there will be people who deal in quantities of cocaine that are much purer... people who are further up the chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.192" offset="8858184">And the statute allows a court to take that into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.144" offset="8869991">After all, the phrase mixture or substance is responsible for two things under 841(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.178" offset="8894129">It can trigger a mandatory minimum, and it can set a range.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.032" offset="8909489">But it's within that range that a district court can sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.424" offset="8923072">It's not irrational, therefore, for Congress to legislate in this manner, because what Congress decided to do was change the drug sentencing system around.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.769" offset="8964450">In 1970, Congress took its first step at this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.763" offset="8980437">It passed the Comprehensive Drug Abuse and Prevention and Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.895" offset="8992976">That act classified controlled substances according to schedules and set penalties based on the type of schedule involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.770" offset="9020457">Congress changed the system in 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.793" offset="9032578">As part of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act, Congress introduced the principle that the sentence should vary according to the purity of the drug involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.747" offset="9064342">And then in 1986, Congress once again revised the system and adopted the one we now have today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.522" offset="9091405">In the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Congress introduced the principle that the mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of a drug should be used as the basis for calculating the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.448" offset="9135187">The statute is quite clear in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.859" offset="9144800">This was not a careless way of drafting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.082" offset="9153681">What's clear is that you cannot simply look to the amount of pure drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.254" offset="9170400">Certainly when you're dealing with drugs like cocaine or heroin, and also when you're dealing with the... drugs like LSD.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.787" offset="9192551">And the reason... one of the reasons you know that from the text of the statute itself is that the pure quantity of methamphetamine or PCP can sometimes serve as the basis for sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.486" offset="9235288">Congress, therefore, clearly knew how to distinguish between the quantity of pure drug involved and the quantity of the mixture or substance containing detectable amount of the pure drug involved, and it is the latter that we have here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2475.986" offset="10033276">There are four ways drugs can be taken into the human body.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.540" offset="10051562">And after all, unless these types of drugs are taken into the human body, they are not going to have the desired effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.480" offset="10075281">You can take it orally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.293" offset="10082491">You can inhale it, in which case it goes into the lungs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.875" offset="10096911">It can pass through a mucus membrane in the nose or under the tongue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.246" offset="10110390">Or it can be injected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.538" offset="10115510">So, if you have a situation where you have something that is going to be actually consumed, taken into the body, it is a reasonable way of looking at that as being a substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.855" offset="10152813">Nobody therefore is going to have any difficulty I think distinguishing an automobile and a suitcase from a tablet or blotter paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.689" offset="10184160">Like I say, a tablet that you take that has LSD enters the body and the body breaks it down, and the drug is then dispersed throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.897" offset="10216969">That's a relatively easy way I think of looking at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.418" offset="10227000">And that's the way in fact some... several of the courts of appeals have looked at it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2822.932" offset="11421110">Petitioners have also leveled the constitutional challenges to the statute, and we think the challenges have to fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.109" offset="11465831">What Congress did was try to strike a drug trafficking, as I said, in whatever form it was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.452" offset="11487147">It used weight as the medium for trying to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.735" offset="11500313">It could have used just the type of drug that was involved, as it did in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.028" offset="11517449">It could have used the purity of the drug involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.149" offset="11525913">And it could even have used the dosage numbers, which is what petitioners say Congress should have done in the case of LSD.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.533" offset="11551513">But we don't think Congress had to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.404" offset="11559036">The dilution rate that shows up in these sorts of cases is similar to the dilution rate that shows up in the case of heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.598" offset="11583800">Therefore, it's not bizarre to see these types of results.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.612" offset="11599787">What you have here is a situation also in which there's no First Amendment, no conceivable First Amendment claim, that can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.365" offset="11626850">The result is Congress is entitled to require people to stay a long way from the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.038" offset="11649524">And Congress is entitled to regulate with, generally speaking, a very blunt instrument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.202" offset="11670213">Congress doesn't have to make the types of refinements that the petitioners would like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.783" offset="11684529">And the best proof of that I guess is that this Court's decisions would allow Congress to pass a flat determinant sentencing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.539" offset="11715562">Whether you distribute one dose of LSD or a thousand doses of LSD, you get 20 years in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.144" offset="11741893">That, too, is a rather blunt instrument for regulating the narcotics traffick, but it is one that Congress has the power to adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.338" offset="11770733">As I said at the outset, LSD infused... infused blotter paper is a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of LSD.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.494" offset="11799363">That is a reasonable construction of the statute in light of the market-oriented approach that Congress adopted, and the market-oriented approach is a reasonable way of striking at the drug trade.</text>

            <text syncTime="2995.846" offset="12112728">And there's no rational relationship here between what the offender is doing when he's selling it on a... on a heavier paper and getting a longer sentence for doing that, because it has nothing to do with culpability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.883" offset="12156927">I've been waiting throughout two arguments in the... in the Seventh Circuit and this argument for the Government to suggest some rational reason for sentencing two identically situated offenders differently when they've committed exactly the same conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="3022.744" offset="12220352">I think that's why this Court is going to have to find, first, that that can't be what Congress intended by the phrase "mixture or substance".</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.777" offset="12248460">And secondly, that if that's what Congress intended, the law has to be struck down, because it violates the right to equal protection of the law.</text>
