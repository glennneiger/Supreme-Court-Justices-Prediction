            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73954">The opinions of the Court in two cases will be announced by Justice Stevens.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="6.997" offset="101853">The two cases I have to announce are Chisom against Roemer and the League of United Latin-American Citizens Council against Clemens.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.432" offset="139678">Both of the cases come to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.143" offset="166427">They both present the same basic question concerning the coverage of Section two of the Voting Rights Act as amended in 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.391" offset="199446">One of them is a challenge to the method of electing the two members of the Louisiana Supreme Court who represent the four parishes that comprise the New Orleans metropolitan area.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.175" offset="242601">The other is a challenge to the method of electing trial judges in 10 counties in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.622" offset="264439">In both cases in this court, the petitioners rely exclusively on Section two of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.268" offset="290979">And in both cases, the Fifth Circuit held that their claims are outside the coverage of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.754" offset="312922">The basic question presented then is whether the so-called results test that was added to the Voting Rights Act in 1982 is applicable to a claim alleging that an at large method of electing judges violates the statute, or stating the question somewhat differently whether Section 2 is amended has the same application to judicial elections that it has to the election of other public officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.603" offset="412292">The word of history will help explain the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.393" offset="423472">The Fifteenth Amendment to the constitution broadly provides that the right of citizens to vote shall not be denied or abridged by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.971" offset="473836">Section two of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was essentially a statutory qualification of that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.830" offset="505183">It unquestionably applied to all state elections, including the elections of legislators, executive officials, and judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.955" offset="537680">In 1980, in the case of City of Mobil against Boldon, a plurality of this court concluded that neither the 15th Amendment nor Section two was violated unless the plaintiff could prove intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.184" offset="594627">That decision prompted congress to amend the statute in 1982 to eliminate the requirement of proof of intentional discrimination and to substitute a so-called results test under which a violation can be proved by evidence that an election practice has resulted in the denial or abridgment of the right to vote based on color or race.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.252" offset="682921">Because language in the amendment describing the results test refers to the need to prove that members of the protected class have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.337" offset="751257">The majority of the judges on the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit focusing their attention on the use of the word, representatives, included that congress did not intend a new test to be applicable to judicial elections or at least to every discriminatory practice used in judicial elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.480" offset="823773">We disagree with this reading of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.289" offset="835058">We conclude that the coverage provided by the 1982 amendment is co-extensive with the coverage provided by the Act prior to 1982 and the judicial elections are embraced within that coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.977" offset="885840">The amendment was unquestionably intended to expand the protection of the statute and our examination of the extensive legislative history of the amendment discloses no evidence whatsoever that congress intended to exclude any category of elections whether of judges, executive officials, or legislatures from the protection afforded by that amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.530" offset="968073">We believe that if congress had intended to exclude any category of claims involving judicial elections from coverage under the amended Act that it would have said so explicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.488" offset="1007884">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in both cases and remand for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.000" offset="1037872">Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.451" offset="1059711">And Justice Kennedy has also filed a separate dissenting statement in one of the cases.</text>
