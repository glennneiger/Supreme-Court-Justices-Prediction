            <text syncTime="17.795" offset="202784">We depend upon our doctors to tell us the whole truth, whoever is paying the medical bill... the patient or the government, whether in a Title X clinic or in the Bethesda Naval Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.804" offset="266836">Especially when a medical test confirms a condition that we had worried about, we all, I think, rely on the doctor to level with us in a discussion that follows the diagnosis.</text>

            <text syncTime="48.397" offset="325141">They supervise, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.631" offset="330052">They are not always the personal counselor, but under the Title X regulations they are responsible for supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.670" offset="362235">And the health care professionals to whom women speak, whether doctors or not, are ones that I think one would trust to tell one the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.608" offset="397970">And if the government were to play a role in the picture I think we would assume that its role is to make sure that nothing relevant is left out.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.548" offset="429735">But if any of us were to discover that the government instead had arranged to have the doctor or the health care professional omit all information about one legally-available medical option and give you a referral list that is clearly tilted in the direction of the other option, regardless of what dangers there might be to your health, I would suppose that most of us would conclude that the government had used its bargaining power to betray a rather basic trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.817" offset="558885">Its contract with the doctor, if that really were a fair description of the situation, would violate its more fundamental contract with all of us, including the First and Fifth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.743" offset="610503">By conditioning Title X grants on the regulations that we challenge in this case, the government, in the words of Judge Cardamone, concurring below, sets a trap for the unwary.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.587" offset="665882">The reason, quite simply, is that under these regulations not even the petitioners' private funds, sometimes in excess of three times the size of the Federal grant, may be used to provide uncensored medical information to the patients enrolled in the petitioners' Title X family planning clinics.</text>

            <text syncTime="157.635" offset="762117">I don't understand that to be the case, so long as those funds are not used in the Title X program.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.372" offset="793046">The Title X program, by the way, is how much Federal money?</text>
            <text syncTime="171.010" offset="815616">It's at least 90 percent, is it?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="172.712" offset="822408">Well, actually, Justice Scalia, the regulation makes reference to a 90-10 ratio, but, as the counsel for the Secretary explicitly conceded in oral argument in the First Circuit at footnote 59 of the Planned Parenthood brief, it's been a very long time since they have made any effort to live up with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.541" offset="905686">The reason has been that as Federal funds have diminished and as the government, I think quite understandably, has not wanted to penalize clinics for growing, the norm now is that the Title X program project, as defined under 59.2 of the regs, is typically funded at a level of 50 percent or less, as the Secretary conceded in the First Circuit, of the Federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.776" offset="1010699">So that, for example, in the case of the clinics in this case, in Westchester-Rockland it's about 23 percent, in the case of the City of New York it's about 50.</text>

            <text syncTime="231.798" offset="1058764">The 90-10 does have, actually, a statutory origin, and there is some confusion, I understand, about whether the statute has been properly construed by the Secretary of HHS in allowing the reach of the Federal hand to exceed this 10 percent Federal fisk.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.580" offset="1145908">But, in any event, there's no dispute that the entire program... the family planning program at the Hub in the Bronx, the family planning program, including, as the regs call it, the comprehensive coherent set of plans and program... including the private money, is encumbered by these regulations.</text>

          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="275.493" stopTime="290.920">
            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="275.493" offset="1233575">I suppose we ought to evaluate the Federal statute and the regulations under the Federal statute on the basis of what Congress contemplated when it passed it, and Congress appears to have contemplated a program that is at least 90 percent Federal money.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="290.920" stopTime="396.106">
            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="290.920" offset="1295224">That has been argued in various courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.741" offset="1310584">It is still not resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.424" offset="1317272">I would say that much of our argument is completely independent of whether the private funds are 10 percent or 50 percent, because we will be arguing that in this case the regulations are sufficiently viewpoint-based that it would not be permissible for the government to impose them, even as a condition of expending its own funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.939" offset="1411313">But when I reach that point, Justice Scalia, I think I will be adding a couple of thoughts about the way in which those arguments relate.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.212" offset="1440465">The government actually claims no general authority, even with its own money, to trick patients about their medical situation after they have come to trust a doctor in a government-assisted clinic, and they certainly don't affirmatively claim that with respect to private funds they have the power to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.190" offset="1512354">Their basic claim is quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.974" offset="1519459">Their claim is that once the client is diagnosed as pregnant the Title X program, the provision of services, is over, so that the further discussion that might be had about abortion is simply outside the scope of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.366" offset="1577033">I think the fairest way to respond to that is simply to say that it just is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.753" offset="1598558">Much of section 59.8 of the regulations is expressly directed to post-conception services, with only abortion counseling and referral banned.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.645" offset="1642130">The section details the kind of information that a Title X client must be given once pregnancy is diagnosed, and indeed under the original version of the regulations it had said, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="390.952" offset="1695420">"no medical services or counseling after pregnancy is diagnosed. "</text>

            <text syncTime="425.523" offset="1833660">It should include an annual physical examination, and the regulations themselves have contemplated and the statute has said from the beginning that one must provide more than just a kind of pregnancy kit and see you later.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.199" offset="1888413">And indeed the original version was objected to on the dramatic ground that it would permit no "counseling which discourages abortion".</text>
            <text syncTime="450.055" offset="1931776">The Secretary explained at 53 Federal Register 2926 that that is why the current version does not contain any language suggesting that the program finishes when pregnancy is diagnosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.898" offset="1987156">The aim was put very clearly in 52 Federal Register at 33.2.12, and I quote: "The express purpose"... and this is the purpose of the regulations about how the dialogue after diagnosis is to proceed...</text>

            <text syncTime="528.257" offset="2244619">The concept of family planning under the program is a somewhat broader concept than would be suggested by a kind of truck stop pregnancy test.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.678" offset="2274294">That is, many of these women are enrolled throughout their reproductive lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.280" offset="2288713">When they are diagnosed as pregnant, the statute and the regulations in fact do not authorize the provision to these women of the gynecological, obstetrical, prenatal and other services that they might need.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.170" offset="2336256">But the idea is that an important part of the program is not simply to put them out on the street without advice, without information.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.359" offset="2361020">It is at that point to have a discussion with them about the options available, and in that discussion the regulations are quite clear in specifically prohibiting even neutral discussion about one option, namely abortion, and at the same time mandating with respect to the other option in this mutually-exclusive pair of medical choices, mandating the provision of a prenatal list, a list of prenatal care centers, which under the regulations must include all prenatal care providers in the area, must exclude all clinics specializing in abortion, and must be limited to clinics that are committed to the welfare both of the unborn child and of the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.774" offset="2550669">So that the message, quite plainly, of your doctor handing you, after a pregnancy diagnosis, a list of this sort and saying this is a list of places that will be concerned with you welfare and that of the unborn child is basically that your welfare is not endangered by the birth of the child, and the implicit message is that abortion needn't concern you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1368.870" offset="5607100">But the reference to abortion as a method of family planning, Justice Scalia, the words "family planning" I think have no meaning under the government's reading of the statute or ours, in this sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.809" offset="5650777">If a therapeutic abortion, an abortion for reasons of health, were not encompassed within that concept, then there'd be nothing in the statute that would even prevent the use of Federal funds directly for the performance of abortion to protect the woman's health.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="1793.759" offset="7306627">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.193" offset="7324390">In light of what we have heard this morning, let me begin with a few very brief points of clarification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.216" offset="7356468">First, the context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.418" offset="7369216">This case involves a Federal program that is specialized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.589" offset="7397951">It is not Medicaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.774" offset="7406624">It is not community health services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.326" offset="7416864">It is a family planning program and which the Secretary views, consistent with Congress's intent, as being a term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.867" offset="7459077">It means, as the conference committee report suggested, preventive services, preconceptional services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.906" offset="7499202">It does not mean counseling or treating a pregnant woman, other than as part of her transition out of the family planning project, the Title X project, to another health care provider.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.434" offset="7565344">That is what these regulations were designed to do in response to criticisms leveled at the program by the General Accounting Office, by the Inspector General, and then pursuant... and I think this is important in terms of the orderliness of the procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.980" offset="7643502">There was a notice and comment rulemaking here which was responsive to the very kinds of concerns that had been identified by the General Accounting Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.335" offset="7688955">That is to say the Secretary, among other things, had proceeded in a very informal way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.505" offset="7713615">There had never been regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.791" offset="7722705">There had only been informal memoranda from the Office of General Counsel which were responding to ad hoc requests for essentially a no-action kind of letter or advice and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.717" offset="7778398">Guidelines were finally promulgated in 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.736" offset="7794490">Those guidelines themselves represented a shift in the agency's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.656" offset="7818209">Frankly, there had been, prior to the notice and comment rulemaking, great uncertainty and confusion and indeed I don't overstate it by saying chaos in the system as to precisely what was permitted and what was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.416" offset="7877246">And in the notice of proposed rulemaking and throughout the Secretary made it very clear that this program was limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.105" offset="7912041">Professor Tribe has quoted from the Federal Register.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.890" offset="7927087">Let me share one very brief quote as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.109" offset="7940044">The Secretary said... this is at 52 Federal Register 33.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.744" offset="7962509">2.11...</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.679" offset="7966271">"as clearly contemplated by Title X and its legislative history, family planning is meant to address plans and methods for facilitating or preventing pregnancy, not for terminating it. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.557" offset="8037846">"As such, medical services or counseling relating to pregnancy care after pregnancy diagnosis or any services relating to abortion as a method of family planning are outside the scope of activity supported by Title X funds. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1997.054" offset="8119766">General Starr, do you take the position that the way the program was being run before these current regulations went into effect somehow did not meet the requirements of the statute?</text>

            <text syncTime="2034.929" offset="8271277">What the Secretary saw as the purpose was not to encourage or promote abortion, and that was being done.</text>
