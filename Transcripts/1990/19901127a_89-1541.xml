            <text syncTime="26.430" offset="236710">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="29.642" offset="249562">This case concerns the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.634" offset="269520">In that act Congress established a comprehensive regime for occupational safety and health.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.628" offset="293553">Congress gave the Secretary of Labor the authority to set occupational safety and health standards through issuing regulations, and he gave the Secretary the authority to administer the program through a variety of means, including inspecting businesses and issuing citations for violations of the statute or regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.181" offset="367740">At the same time Congress created the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.144" offset="387593">Its sole function is to hear challenges to the citations.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.947" offset="402849">The Commission's decisions, in turn, are reviewable in the courts of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.792" offset="422180">The question in this case is whether, when the Secretary and the Commission disagree about the meaning of the Secretary's regulations, deference should be given to the Secretary or to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.237" offset="463975">We believe that deference should be given to the Secretary because Congress gave the Secretary the authority to make policy through issuing regulations and administering the program, and the ability to provide reasonable interpretations of those regulations is an aspect of that policy-making authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="114.320" offset="588318">So the error that was made here, in your view, was made at the Commission level by its failure to defer to the Secretary's position?</text>

            <label>Mr. Clifford M. Sloan</label>

            <text syncTime="126.374" offset="636488">We believe that the Commission failed to give proper deference to the Secretary's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.619" offset="653520">For the reviewing court, we believe that the question should be the same as for the Commission, which is whether the Secretary's interpretation was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.685" offset="689778">And so therefore the reviewing court should just address that question directly, considering carefully the Commission's opinion and the light that it can shed on that issue, but basically facing the same question that the Commission was facing.</text>

            <text syncTime="158.715" offset="765847">There is a regulation that appears to be more clearly in point for this particular violation, and that was (g)(4)(i), and the Secretary, or the department never amended its complaint to refer to that regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.469" offset="840870">It chose to rely instead on the training regulation for the violation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Clifford M. Sloan</label>
            <text syncTime="183.614" offset="865425">The reason for that was that the regulation that was relied on was perfectly appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.098" offset="891443">The particular provision is a training provision, but it has a fitting component.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.070" offset="911296">It specifically refers to respirators being fitted properly, and it's important--</text>

            <label>Justice O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="200.262" offset="932090">Well, when you rely on the training regulation, it's perhaps ambiguous, or you have to stretch to see how it applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.779" offset="962183">But if reliance had been placed on the other regulation it would seem rather clear, wouldn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="213.924" offset="986738">--Well, in terms of some of the objections that have been raised to it, those objections would not be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.608" offset="1013487">But let me address the separate fit provision in its context.</text>

            <text syncTime="223.661" offset="1025713">Yeah, I just... it seems the present interpretation would appear to make it duplicative.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.653" offset="1049641">You don't even need (g)(4)(i), I guess, in light of the Secretary's reading of the training regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="248.555" offset="1125291">--Two... there are two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.566" offset="1133233">One has to do with (g)(4)(i), and one has to do with (g)(3), which is what incorporates the general respirator provision of section 134.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.065" offset="1175238">Taking (g)(4)(i) first, what remains of that provision is a vestige of the original provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.579" offset="1201360">It was initially, as promulgated by the Secretary, an entirely different provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.290" offset="1216198">The sentence that is there now, which has the language 134, "fitted properly", that initially was followed by a specific quantitative fit requirement which is very different from the qualitative fit test which is at issue in this case, the banana oil test where an employee puts on a respirator and is asked if he can detect the smell of the banana oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.715" offset="1309925">That's a qualitative fit test.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.448" offset="1316821">A quantitative fit test actually measures on a quantitative basis the exposure that the respirator is allowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.143" offset="1351616">Initially (g)(4)(i) included a quantitative fit provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.785" offset="1370111">The "fitted properly" sentence was the first sentence, and it then went on to the quantitative fit provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.228" offset="1391949">The quantitative fit requirement was invalidated in the course of litigation within the year and a half previously to this inspection here, which was in August 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.945" offset="1438761">That had been invalidated in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.717" offset="1449837">Now, the first sentence of (g)(4)(i) ultimately, when the Secretary corrected the regulation, kept the first sentence, but it was a very different provision from the one that had initially been there.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.127" offset="1495499">And so that's, in terms of the context on (g)(4)(i)--</text>

            <text syncTime="360.407" offset="1572612">--Okay, and that gets to the second... that gets to the second question, the second part of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.012" offset="1591107">The second part of the question has to do with (g)(3) in Section 134 and its scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.964" offset="1610855">There are many circumstances in which section (g)(3), applies, and there is no separate fit provision as in (g)(4)(i).</text>
            <text syncTime="382.945" offset="1662787">It applies of its own force in many circumstances, and it applies, sometimes when it's incorporated in another regulation, without a sentence as is now in (g)(4)(i).</text>
            <text syncTime="393.280" offset="1704165">In those circumstances the Secretary has consistently interpreted section 134 to impose a fit requirement, and if the conclusion that section 134 does not impose a fit requirement because of the existence of this separate fit provision in (g)(4)(i), would strip the regulation of an essential part of its meaning, in the Secretary's view, in those other contexts, even though the predicate for doing so, the separate fit provision, is not... is not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.730" offset="1829971">And the reason that I'm going into this background is to say that section 134, which is incorporated, has a broad applicability, and this is the standard way that it has been interpreted.</text>

            <text syncTime="468.588" offset="2005409">And so it was a perfectly valid interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="706.358" offset="2956475">It does require the employer to put the employee in a test atmosphere, but it then leaves the employer entirely free to ignore the test results and to send the worker back into the work environment with the respirator after getting results indicating that the respirator does not fit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1388.725" offset="5685958">In terms of the penalty, the... there are four factors that the Commission can consider in determining the appropriate penalty, and in some cases in eliminating a penalty altogether, and those are the size of the business, the gravity of the violation, the good faith of the employer, and the previous history of violations of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.748" offset="5765997">And in those kinds of factual discretionary determinations the Commission gets substantial deference, and it is the Commission rather than the Secretary that is entitled to deference on those questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1457.290" offset="5960139">What this case is about is a direct attack by the Secretary of Labor on the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.077" offset="5991277">The Secretary seeks to overturn a compromise reached by Congress when it considered this legislation more than 20 years ago, and she seeks to upset a system of checks and balances that has been in place since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.026" offset="6043104">In considering the alternative bills before it in 1970, members of Congress expressed strong concern that placing all the administrative power in one agency head, the Secretary of the Labor, would not gain the acceptance of the regulated community that was necessary to achieve the objectives of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.488" offset="6120949">To resolve these concerns Congress reached a compromise, and that compromise was to remove the adjudicatory authority from the Secretary and place it in an independent agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.746" offset="6174029">The Review Commission was given the express authority to carry out the adjudicatory functions of the... under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.598" offset="6197435">The Secretary's position today is that the Commission has no policy-making authority in its role as the adjudicator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.456" offset="6228887">The Secretary in a sense... her position would rip the heart out of the adjudicatory authority that has been given to the Commission, and would render the Commission nothing more than a rubber stamp.</text>

            <text syncTime="2302.655" offset="9341638">The Secretary here argues that the Commission has no policy-making power.</text>

            <text syncTime="2322.067" offset="9419273">We believe it is clear, from the statute and the APA, the kind of authority the Commission is to have in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2335.417" offset="9472668">As I said previously, as this matter was being considered by Congress, there were strong concerns presented that placing all of the authority in the Secretary would not gain the confidence of the regulated community necessary to achieve voluntary compliance, necessary to achieve the objectives of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.689" offset="9541735">So Congress reached a compromise, and that compromise was to place adjudicatory power in the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="2383.907" offset="9666601">And in looking at the competing interests, what Congress said, and the compromise that was reached, is that in the Occupational Safety and Health area, where it covers such a broad number of industries, there should be significant power, adjudicatory power, in the Commission to deal with factual settings and factual circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.681" offset="9745700">And Congress looked to the FTC and the National Labor Relations Board as the examples under which they decided the authority the Commission should have.</text>

            <text syncTime="2682.001" offset="10859038">Our position is that controlling deference, as outlined in Chevron, only applies when the agency is acting under its delegated authority by Congress, in a format delegated by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2697.683" offset="10921732">And I... there is a lot of confusion around the word deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.055" offset="10935211">We're not saying that interpretation is not entitled to some weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.017" offset="10951094">In fact, it should be given weight by the Commission, and it was.</text>

            <text syncTime="2716.694" offset="10997801">In Bowen, the official action was simply the denial of benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2726.171" offset="11035731">And that action didn't necessarily rest on a particular interpretation of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2781.388" offset="11256622">And I view that virtually the same as what was happening in Bowen, is that the Secretary came into litigation and explained... tried to explain... a basis for retroactively applying the regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2796.427" offset="11316704">It said no, we won't accept your explanation when it is not the basis for the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.210" offset="11343871">In addition to Bowen, this Court has made it very clear that to be entitled to controlling weight an agency must act in the forum that is delegated by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.130" offset="11395489">In Batterton the Court distinguished between deference and the kinds of weights that I have been talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.024" offset="11419104">In Batterton the Court said if it's a delegated authority, it's entitled to controlling weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.918" offset="11442718">If it's something less than delegated authority, it may be entitled to weight, but it's a different weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.792" offset="11466229">I referred previously to the recommendation of the Administrative Conference of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.734" offset="11485977">The Administrative Conference considered precisely this issue inn 1989, and in July of 1989 issued a recommendation that says in order for an agency to be entitled to controlling weight under Chevron it should act in a rule-making power, a formal adjudication, or in some other forum delegated by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.540" offset="11573226">If the agency has not acted in that forum, it is not entitled to controlling weight.</text>

            <text syncTime="2956.702" offset="11957853">The difference here, Justice White, is that Congress has separated the functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.494" offset="11973004">Congress took the adjudicatory power from the Secretary, and all that that entails, took that from the Secretary and placed it in the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.741" offset="12009993">So in this case you have a split, split agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.682" offset="12021696">You have split powers, that the Secretary can operate through the rule-making power, and the Commission can operate through the adjudicatory power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.569" offset="12057327">They both have a policy-making function.</text>

            <text syncTime="2991.935" offset="12098810">And as Justice Scalia noted in his concurring opinion in Bowen, is that a rule... or excuse me, an order based on adjudication is to determine what the law was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.253" offset="12148024">That is precisely what the Commission did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.433" offset="12156802">It determined what the law was.</text>

            <text syncTime="3009.775" offset="12170072">That's its... that's its function under the act, and that is why it should receive controlling weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.949" offset="12190865">What the Secretary is trying to do here is raise the same questions that were raised before Congress in 1970 and were rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.965" offset="12222839">The Secretary is saying I want that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.737" offset="12233915">I want all the policy power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.318" offset="12240289">The Commission does not have any policy power in its adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.890" offset="12254604">That is not what Congress intended, and that is not what Congress said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.194" offset="12271845">What Congress said, we are concerned, we will not, and we refuse to place all the power in the Secretary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3043.899" offset="12306640">And that's... that's what the Secretary is trying to take back today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.960" offset="12322836">And she's trying to take it back, not in a formal rule-making proceeding, she's trying to take it back through the issuance of a compliance order, or an order by a compliance officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.497" offset="12360975">He is one of a thousand compliance officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.449" offset="12372782">He issues it and says this is my interpretation, this is what the standard means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.513" offset="12389082">And now the Secretary is bolstering it in Court by her arguments of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.843" offset="12402353">That is not the way she is to operate; that is not the delegated authority by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.788" offset="12422206">She is to exercise her policy power through making rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.081" offset="12435371">She did make a standard in this case, but it's ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.454" offset="12448851">It didn't say what was intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.313" offset="12456269">Therefore she tries to explain it by other means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.454" offset="12464838">This Court should reject that explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.507" offset="12473092">It is not entitled to controlling weight under Chevron.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.678" offset="12481765">The Secretary should not be allowed to circumvent the procedural requirements that Congress set out for her to exercise her rule-making authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.353" offset="12516455">And therefore we think the judgment, or the judgment of the Tenth Circuit should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.256" offset="12535995">It was correct when it said it would look to the reasonableness of the final order of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.890" offset="12562535">That final order was reasonable, and therefore was entitled to controlling weight and entitled to deference over the litigation positions of the Secretary.</text>

            <label>Mr. Clifford M. Sloan</label>
            <text syncTime="3121.649" offset="12617602">Just a few brief points, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.822" offset="12626274">First, respondent places great weight repeatedly on the phrase "controlling weight" as a decisive factor here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.016" offset="12663055">Respondent fails to point out that in this Court's consistent decisions on an entity's interpretations of its own regulations, which almost by definition are not embodied in the regulation, the Court has repeatedly said that those interpretations are entitled to controlling weight unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.849" offset="12738392">That has been the settled standard that the Court has applied in this category of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.233" offset="12755946">Secondly, respondent contends that the Commission was given a policy-making function, and there is no evidence of that in the statute or in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.751" offset="12802026">The contrast between the Commission's role and the role of the NLRB or the Federal Trade Commission could not be more stark, for those entities are specifically given policy-making authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.625" offset="12841523">And, as this Court has held in cases like Chenery and Bell Aerospace, the reason that those entities can announce policies in the course of adjudication is precisely because they have the choice of making that policy in other means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.285" offset="12896171">They have been given the policy-making authority, and it is that that the Commission lacks here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.138" offset="12915607">Third, in terms of just the context of this case, the second very case-specific issue that respondent repeatedly talks about, it is not true that the only evidence of the Secretary's interpretation is embodied in the citation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.730" offset="12989899">Even if it were, it would be entitled to deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.071" offset="12999303">As we have pointed out in the reply brief, in January of 1979 the Secretary, in the Industrial Hygiene Field Operations Manual, had said in interpreting this provision that respirators must fit properly, and in subsequent interpretation in April of 1979, which is Exhibit C(11) before the administrative law judge, at page 2, the Secretary again said... referred to this specific provision as a training and fitting standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.520" offset="13113092">In 1980 the Secretary issued another instruction, and that has consistently been the Secretary's interpretation with respect to whether a fit requirement is imposed.</text>
