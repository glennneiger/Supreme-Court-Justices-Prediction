            <text syncTime="13.600" offset="186694">We are here this afternoon on Salve Regina College's petition for certiorari to the First Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.535" offset="222429">The college contends that the court of appeals erred when it failed to predict or attempt to analyze how the Rhode Island supreme court would likely rule on an unclear question of State law, in this case on which jurisdiction was based solely upon diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.920" offset="304036">Instead the court of appeals deferred to the district court's largely unsupported prognostication that the Rhode Island supreme court would apply the commercial contract doctrine of substantial performance in the unique context of the relationship between a college and a student.</text>

            <text syncTime="159.835" offset="771628">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.366" offset="773822">That's our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.157" offset="776957">The... this case arose in a rather exotic factual context.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.660" offset="798899">The respondent matriculated to Salve Regina College as a freshman.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.883" offset="819797">During the freshman year she applied to become a candidate in the, in the college's department of nursing, a candidate for a nursing degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.211" offset="861175">She began her nursing studies as a sophomore.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.642" offset="878834">Right from the first day of her nursing studies, when the faculty was explaining to students their expectations of students, the faculty privately advised the respondent that they felt that she could potentially have problems in the clinical portions of the curriculum in the future which... the clinical portions would begin during the junior year... because of a medical condition that she had.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.581" offset="990638">The respondent suffered from a rather severe addictive eating disorder which led to her being morbidly obese.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.586" offset="1018641">She was at the time that she started her nursing studies more than twice the normal body weight for a person of her size and body build.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.563" offset="1062527">She was advised by the faculty right from the beginning that she had some time to try to address this problem and they recommended that she seek treatment and do what she could to attempt to solve this problem before she started her clinical studies during her junior year.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.505" offset="1130341">Despite this advice the respondent did not seek treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.617" offset="1150821">In fact her condition became worse during the time that she was a student at the college.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.351" offset="1173704">As the faculty predicted, in fact her size did become a problem during the clinical training.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.745" offset="1207246">This culminated in the middle of her junior year when her senior clinical instructor gave her what amounted to a failing clinical evaluation, all for reasons that in some way or another related to her weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.097" offset="1264715">As a result, and as a result of the college's longstanding policy that a failure in the clinical program would mean dismissal from the program in its entirety, the faculty met with the student and they came to an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.437" offset="1338067">Because this was an unusual situation where the student's failure seemed to be related to her weight, the college agreed that they would enter into a formal agreement with the student under which the student was allowed to continue in the program on a probationary basis provided that she met certain requirements and the requirements were that she enter into a treatment program and that she lose a certain amount of weight prior to entering the senior year clinical aspects of the curriculum.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.519" offset="1462410">The record below reflects that although the student began complying with the terms of this agreement, after a short period of time, in fact, her compliance stopped and the end result was that just prior to the beginning of her senior it was very clear that not only did she not meet the terms of the agreement, she didn't come close to meeting the terms of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.686" offset="1567004">At that point she was told that she could not enter the senior year clinical aspects of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.901" offset="1595948">The respondent responded in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.693" offset="1607128">First, she transferred to another institution and sought medical and psychological treatment which culminated in her undergoing a rather radical surgical procedure which led to her losing some 50 percent of her overweightness, after which she did graduate and today is a nurse.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.703" offset="1683092">She also responded by filing a lawsuit against Salve Regina on a wide variety of Federal and State law claims, ranging from handicapped discrimination and alleged due process violations to intentional infliction of emotional distress.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.965" offset="1752160">All of these claims, save and except a simple State law breach of contract claim, were dismissed either on summary judgment or were directed out at the close of the plaintiff's case in chief.</text>

            <text syncTime="427.902" offset="1843902">The First Circuit applied this rule of deference, what it called a traditional rule of deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.916" offset="1875980">This rule that the circuit applied is an important rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.409" offset="1889982">It's important because it's applied to all diversity cases, which make up some 20 to 25 percent of the docket of the Federal district courts, some 15 percent of the docket of the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.467" offset="1938152">But it applies to other cases as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.708" offset="1947138">It applies to a whole variety of cases in which State law serves as the rule of decision for one reason or another.</text>

            <text syncTime="1880.934" offset="7656042">There were several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.344" offset="7661685">First, Your Honor, we met the diversity of citizenship test at the time and the fact of the matter is that the trial calendar in the Federal court in Providence was a more rapidly reached trial than what we in the State supreme court, the superior court... our superior court in the State court has a crowded calendar of some 4 to 5 years to a trial and fortunately the Federal district judges in Providence are able to get their cases out within 12 to 18 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.453" offset="7774116">That was one of the really compelling reasons that we brought the case in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.784" offset="7791461">It languished for a long time, because Judge Selya had the matter when he was a district judge and reserved decision on the motion for a summary judgment, and that took some period of time before that decision came down, and when he did come down with his decision, he said he would hold the case and try it himself when he could get off the circuit court long enough to hear it at the district court level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.191" offset="7889055">And some year and a half went by while he tried to do that and ultimately he had to excuse himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.065" offset="7912565">And that's why it ultimately was tried by a different judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.897" offset="7923850">So the delay in the actual trial of the case was one that occurred because a Federal judge was trying to accommodate a calendar situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.333" offset="7961675">But had... these cases set absolutely no precedent, and it seems to me that when you turn around and say to judges on circuit courts that are already overburdened, trying to find time to write opinions in cases that do set precedent, that when you agree with the district judge that he was right in his interpretation and his guess as to what a State supreme court would do, that if you require them to set down and write these long opinions proving 2 and 2 are 4 or reinventing the wheel, it seems to me you're putting an wholly burden, a wholly unnecessary burden--</text>

            <text syncTime="3282.552" offset="13262547">I would suggest that the cases of this Court interpreting the Erie in fact mandate de novo review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.597" offset="13286684">In the Wichita royalty case, decided only a year after Erie, this Court ruled that a court of appeals is substituted for the State supreme court and must therefore interpret the law the same way as the State supreme court would have declared and applied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.089" offset="13360663">I would suggest that that implies that de novo review is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.791" offset="13379471">Furthermore, in Palmer v. Hoffman, this Court... and other cases... this Court has ruled that State law presumptions and burdens of proof control in a diversity case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.179" offset="13425028">I suggest that it's logical that if presumptions and burdens of proof apply at the trial level then they equally apply at the appellate level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.544" offset="13462436">And in Hanna v. Plumer this Court ruled that it's unfair under Erie for the character or result to materially differ because the suit was brought in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.349" offset="13501724">I would suggest that under the rule of deference at the very least the character, if not the result of the case, does differ because the case was brought in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.619" offset="13546759">Unless the Court has any further questions--</text>
