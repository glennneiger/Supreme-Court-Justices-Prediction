            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="8.378" offset="107400">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.577" offset="128193">The case arises from petitioner Melkonyan’s application for Social Security disability benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.804" offset="157137">The petitioner’s application was denied by the Secretary of Health and Human Services on the grounds that the petitioner was not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.225" offset="202799">Petitioner, then filed a civil action pursuant to 42 United States Code Section 405(g) which is a statute authorizing judicial review of adverse determinations of Social Security claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.460" offset="267792">While the case was pending, the petitioner filed a new application for benefits and supplied additional evidence of disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.025" offset="297989">Petitioner’s second application for benefits was approved by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.278" offset="318992">The Secretary then asked the District Court to remand the pending civil case to the agency for reconsideration in light of the new evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.230" offset="358802">With petitioner’s agreement, the court issued an order remanding the case to the Secretary for all further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.149" offset="390463">On remand, the first decision of the Secretary was vacated and petitioner was found disabled as of his original application date.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.218" offset="426825">More than a year later, the petitioner applied to the District Court for attorney’s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.392" offset="459530">The acronym for which is EAJA.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.481" offset="471860">That Act authorizes an award of fees and expenses to a party prevailing against the United States in a civil action upon application made within 30 days of final judgment and reaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.804" offset="529121">The District Court denied the request on the ground that the Secretary’s position in the litigation had been substantially justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.158" offset="562557">The court of Appeals affirmed but on the basis that the petition was untimely because it was not filed within 30 days of the final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.437" offset="607697">According to the Court of Appeals, the Secretary’s determination on the administrative remand a year earlier, granting the requested relief was the final judgment that triggered the EAJA filing deadline.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.075" offset="670182">We granted certiorari to decide whether an administrative determination can be a final judgment within the meaning of the Equal Access to Justice Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.387" offset="711455">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we unanimously hold for reasons explained in the opinion that the required final judgment for purposes of the Equal Access to Justice Act must be rendered by a court of law rather than by an administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.287" offset="787106">It is not clear on this record whether petitioner is entitled to the attorney’s fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.333" offset="811243">Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings.</text>
