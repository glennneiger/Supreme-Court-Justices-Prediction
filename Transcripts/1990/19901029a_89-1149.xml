            <text syncTime="894.950" offset="3701113">The Eighth Circuit found essentially that collateral estoppel had been improperly applied in this case, because the fraud claim was tried under preponderance of the evidence standard, that section 523, according to the Eighth Circuit, requires proof of the factual elements to establish nondischargeability by clear and convincing evidence, and accordingly, since there were different standards, use of the doctrine of collateral estoppel for factual issue preclusion was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.487" offset="3803304">So we are left with the question what is the appropriate standard of proof under section 523(a)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="928.901" offset="3836950">The petitioners' key point in this case is that issues of nondischargeability regarding fraud judgments are simply a private dispute about money, which is not the kind of case which requires a heightened standard of proof.</text>

            <text syncTime="1202.936" offset="4933048">In May 1985 a jury found respondent liable for common law fraud and securities fraud, and he was ordered to pay damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.823" offset="4964604">In the wake of that verdict, 5 months later, he resorted to bankruptcy court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.315" offset="4982576">The Bankruptcy Code, however, section 523(a)(2)(a), specifies that debts arising from fraud are not dischargeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.141" offset="5017893">That would seem to make this a simple case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1229.905" offset="5040986">Respondent's debt to petitioners is based on a judgment for fraud, and therefore it should not be dischargeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.249" offset="5066377">The decision below, however, makes the case much more complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.730" offset="5084244">According to the Eighth Circuit, petitioners must try their fraud case a second time in bankruptcy court, and this time they must prove fraud by a higher standard than was applicable when they established the existence of the debt in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.862" offset="5140773">Why is that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.792" offset="5148506">Because Congress said so?</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.934" offset="5153103">No, everyone agrees that the statute is silent on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.597" offset="5167732">All that Congress said is that debts arising from fraud are not dischargeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.101" offset="5185704">This is a case in which the Court must provide the appropriate standard of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.475" offset="5207229">And the question is why the Court should depart from the normal standard applicable in civil cases and adopt the heightened standard, when doing so will have two very adverse consequences for the bankruptcy court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.811" offset="5260623">First, it will require full-blown relitigation in bankruptcy court of fraud cases when the debt arising from fraud was previously established by a preponderance of the evidence, as was the case here under Missouri law, and as is typically the case under the Federal antifraud provisions, the securities laws, the commodities laws, the False Claim Act, Medicare and Medicaid fraud, and a variety of financial institution antifraud provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.735" offset="5388310">The second adverse consequence is that the heightened standard of proof would make the bankruptcy court a haven for fraudulent debtors, contrary to the intent of Congress, to this very real extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.441" offset="5439092">To the extent that the victims of fraud are not able to try their case a second time, either because of the expense or because evidence has become stale, and to the extent that they may be able to prove fraud by a preponderance, as they are allowed in their particular State or under the Federal law, but not by a clear and convincing standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.595" offset="5515683">Now, given those adverse consequences, why should the Court adopt the heightened standard of proof?</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.829" offset="5540656">Respondent gives basically two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.002" offset="5553404">One, the fresh start policy of the Bankruptcy Code, and two, that that was the prevailing view at common law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1442.458" offset="5891219">If fraud is shown, the Congress has decided that that is a type of debt that we don't discharge in bankruptcy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1458.509" offset="5955376">Now the other reason that respondent gives for departing from the normal rule and adopting a heightened standard of proof is that Congress, in 1978 when it codified this provision, must have been presumed to be aware that the prevailing view was that fraud must be shown by clear and convincing evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.741" offset="6032280">Now whether that sort of presumption in the face of congressional silence is valid would seem to depend on how dominant a prevailing view we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.357" offset="6070733">There are statements here and there in this Court's decisions that suggest fraud is shown by clear and convincing evidence, but they tend to be more ambiguous than respondent would suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.776" offset="6112424">For example, respondent cites Addington against Texas as holding that fraud must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.032" offset="6141472">What the Court actually said, 441 U.S. at page 424, is that some jurisdictions apply that higher standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.058" offset="6177626">More importantly, careful examination of the common law shows that, while fraud must be proved by clear and convincing evidence in some jurisdictions, I think a bare majority of the jurisdictions, it is in no sense a dominant view such that Congress must be presumed to have intended that view to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.311" offset="6258605">The petitioners, the respondent, and the Government all come up with different counts for which States apply the preponderance standard and which States the clear and convincing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.148" offset="6297893">We think about 20 States apply the preponderance standard, petitioners think there are a few more, and respondents a few less.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.084" offset="6325688">But the point is not to quibble over the nose count.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.406" offset="6338958">This isn't a situation which whoever comes up with the most States wins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.880" offset="6356826">The point is, even respondent concedes that there are 11 States applying the preponderance standard, and he puts 6 more in a gray area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.697" offset="6388173">The point is that if you asked a lawyer in 1978 does fraud have to be proved by clear and convincing evidence, the only answer he could have given was it depends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.202" offset="6430177">It depends if you are in California, which is a preponderance State, or New York, which is a clear and convincing State.</text>

            <text syncTime="2343.116" offset="9493818">Well, those are the few exceptions to the concept of discharge where Congress has determined that if a debt is fraudulently obtained that it should not be excepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.434" offset="9535092">So that is where that line has been drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.317" offset="9546586">But they also, Congress went to great pains to ensure that, as this Court has noted in the past, exceptions to discharge should be strictly construed against the creditor and in favor of the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.913" offset="9596950">Congress added 523(a)(2)(b), which requires reasonable reliance by a lending creditor on a false financial statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.748" offset="9632372">That was new to the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.849" offset="9636760">Congress also added 523(d), ensuring that debtors could obtain attorney's fees if a creditor brought a nondischargeability action in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.457" offset="9679183">Congress declared that the concept of provability of debts was eliminated, thus expanding the claims that would be accepted from discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.434" offset="9715128">They also stated there could be no waiver of the discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.374" offset="9726830">And they codified this Court's decision in Perez v. Campbell with respect to antidiscrimination.</text>

            <label>Mr. Timothy K. McNamara</label>
            <text syncTime="2412.153" offset="9769985">It is incompatible, Justice Blackmun, because the fresh start, being the cornerstone of the bankruptcy laws as this Court noted in Local Loan Company v. Hunt, that is a matter of public interest and it is a matter of great private interest as well for the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.763" offset="9844381">And to ensure that Congress' intent is effectuated and that the fresh start is available, the preponderance test is simply not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.861" offset="9884819">Something greater than the mere preponderance test needs to be shown before denying the debtor what is the very essence of the bankruptcy law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.389" offset="9918883">Congress repeatedly talks about the importance of bolstering the fresh start.</text>

            <text syncTime="2456.191" offset="9946155">Well, you have said that about 10 times now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.703" offset="9952110">I just wonder if you have answered my question.</text>

            <label>Mr. Timothy K. McNamara</label>
            <text syncTime="2459.476" offset="9959216">--It's insufficient not only because of the fresh start, Justice, but also because of the history, as just... Chief Justice Rehnquist noted, of having to prove claims of fraud by something more than a mere preponderance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.543" offset="10011565">That has been treated as a virtual truism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.956" offset="10021178">This Court, admittedly in dicta, but on numerous occasions has acknowledged that civil cases alleging fraud typically require the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.934" offset="10069035">This is not a civil monetary dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.437" offset="10087111">It is not a mere civil monetary dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.138" offset="10097874">We are talking about branding someone as having engaged in fraudulent conduct, and denying them a discharge, treating their debt differently from all other creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.864" offset="10136848">In the Winship case this Court talked about the preponderance test as being susceptible to misinterpretation because it calls on the trier of fact merely to perform an abstract weighing of the evidence in order to determine which side has produced the greater quantum, without regard to its effect in convincing the trier's mind of the truth of the proposition asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.390" offset="10218873">The mere preponderance test does exactly that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.403" offset="10238935">It engages in this abstract way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.353" offset="10246772">The instruction given in this case in the underlying damage suit merely called upon the jury as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.108" offset="10273730">The burden of causing you to believe a proposition of fact is upon the party whose claim or defense depends upon that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.773" offset="10300479">And the converse, if this evidence does not cause you to believe that proposition, then you should not hold in favor of that party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.548" offset="10327542">That abstract weighing is susceptible to that misinterpretation, and at a minimum it seems that the evidence ought to be something more than a mere preponderance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.136" offset="10369861">If in fact congressional intent to grant a debtor the broadest possible relief, as Congress has said it wished to do, and if this Court will... is going to effectuate the fresh start policy, as Congress said in its legislative history that it intended to do, then something more than a mere preponderance is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.070" offset="10453661">Also an argument has been made that allowing a mere preponderance standard to prevail will allow the bankruptcy courts to become a haven for wrongdoers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.266" offset="10494413">That is a very similar argument as that made in the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare v. Davenport case last term, and in that case the Court found that because of the congressional intent that in fact criminal restitution claims may be dischargeable under Chapter 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.758" offset="10564421">The bankruptcy laws will not be a haven for wrongdoers in light of 523(a)(7) and the Kelly v. Robinson case, and the exceptions to the automatic stay in 362(b)(4).</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.636" offset="10615934">The guiding light for this Court should be the fresh start policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.430" offset="10639026">This Court has noted that when Congress fails to specifically spell out in the plain language of the statute what the burden of proof ought to be, and absent any compelling, clear legislative history, in the Midlantic case and in Kelly v. Robinson this Court spoke of looking to the whole law and to its objectives and policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.294" offset="10722514">And certainly the legislative history that does exist with respect to the fresn start policy and with respect to the right of discharge speaks to interpreting this law in favor of the debtor, and strictly construing it, as this Court did in 1915 in the Gleason v. Thaw case against the creditors.</text>
