            <text syncTime="683.957" offset="2858300">And let me state why.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.980" offset="2866450">First of all, as we've noted in our brief the leading lower court case here is a Seventh Circuit case, Associated General Contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.870" offset="2917964">As that case shows, you can have one party bringing the lawsuit and the other party using economic force... the defendant using economic force.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.750" offset="2969477">As the Seventh Circuit held in that case, because of the Norris-LaGuardia Act you can enjoin the nonsuing party from using economic force.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.061" offset="3034783">And against that background, well, we don't think that it's hard and fast.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.197" offset="3063309">It seems to us it would be unsymmetrical, disproportionate, and unsound to say that the suing party could not use economic force.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.077" offset="3114822">But you have not only the contract questions and the contract interpretation questions here but you also have the Norris-LaGuardia Act questions, which as the court noted in the Associated General Contractors case, because that case came up twice... first on a status quo injunction pending a determination by the court and a second time around.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.547" offset="3228716">So the question of whether the use of force is a breach of this no-strike clause pending judicial determination and the question of whether it is enjoinable even if it is a breach of this no-strike clause seems to us to be separate from the question of how do you read the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.367" offset="3347939">Do you read the agreement of permitting the parties to secure what the Seventh Circuit said was the salutary effects of the judicial determination of the meaning of the contract on the basis of the fact that they permitted this option of economic force?</text>

            <text syncTime="1083.649" offset="4457098">The court of appeals points out that this case was litigated on the basis that the agreements were substantially the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="1128.392" offset="4636089">Having taken these detours, let me state what we believe the right rule is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.206" offset="4667332">We believe the right rule is that collective bargaining agreements should not be construed to preclude judicial enforcement unless that is clearly and unmistakably the party's intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.036" offset="4742669">We believe that that is the sound rule of law because of... of the language policies and purposes of section 301 which adds a provision making collective bargaining agreements enforceable in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.623" offset="4832948">As this Court has explained those purposes and policies... most particularly in Lincoln Mills which we set out the basic holding of at pages 10 and 11 of our brief... as the Court said there, Congress point was that unions as well as employees should be bound to collective bargaining contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.737" offset="4977457">There was also a broader concern, a concern with a procedure for making such agreements enforceable in the courts by either party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.062" offset="5014760">Congress, having created this system in order to further industrial peace by making these labor contracts enforceable in the Federal courts, creating quite a constitutional ruckus in doing so, as Lincoln Mills indicates, it seems to us that a determination that the parties have contracted out of the usual processes of the law ought to be one that is clear and unmistakable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.918" offset="5162195">And we believe for the reasons we also spell out in the brief that section 203(d) which recognizes a preference for final adjustment by a method agreed upon by the parties does not cut back on section 201 at all, that looking at the totality of title II of the... of the Taft-Hartley Act the obvious purpose is to further peaceful methods of settlement of the whole point of both section 301 and 203(d) and title II more generally was to create a system in which there are periods of discord when the parties negotiate agreements and to encourage and further systems for the peaceful resolution of contract disputes after the negotiation is concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.972" offset="5426346">Congress did not prohibit the parties from saying that they were going to have a system in which the contract is not enforceable in any sense that one would understand the contract being enforceable, namely a contract being a set of promises which attempts to capture the future and where disagreements on meaning are settled by referring back to the meeting of the minds as reflected in the agreement at the time it was entered into--</text>

            <text syncTime="3237.189" offset="13071237">Just two very brief points if I could.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.493" offset="13088478">First of all, I want to emphasize as Justice Stevens just indicated that this is a question of interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.639" offset="13125049">The whole argument on the other side is, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.039" offset="13138633">"the parties are committed to the process they agreed on. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.993" offset="13150440">The problem is that it isn't plain what the parties agreed on and against that background, we're suggesting what we believe is the better interpretive rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.900" offset="13194117">Secondly, the policies of the Labor Management Relations Act are far more complex than simply that the parties can do whatever they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.386" offset="13232047">That was an argument that the unions made in 1947 and it might have been a better world if we prevailed, but we did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.663" offset="13265170">And Congress provided that one of the policies was stability during the term of collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.260" offset="13307488">Thank you very much.</text>
