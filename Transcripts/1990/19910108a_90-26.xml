            <text syncTime="1527.324" offset="6243273">Nude dancing is sufficiently expressive to at least trigger First Amendment analysis for two independent reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.102" offset="6286427">First, nude dancing is expressive, because performance dance is inherently expressive of emotions and ideas, and second, because nude dancing communicates a particularized message of sensuality and eroticism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.656" offset="6364690">First, performance dance, like music, is one of the oldest forms of human communication and is inherently expressive of emotions and ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.445" offset="6411815">In Ward, this Court found that music is expressive without bothering to determine whether the music at issue did or did not communicate a particularized message.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.752" offset="6461030">A particularized message test applies only to conduct that is not ordinarily expressive, such as flag burning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.479" offset="6503975">Even that kind of conduct can be found expressive if in context it communicates a particularized message.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.904" offset="6529679">But the Court has never used that test to determine whether marching or picketing or other traditionally considered expressive forms of activity are expressive or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.989" offset="6570012">The Court's decisions made clear that if expressive... if conduct is otherwise expressive and protected by the First Amendment, the fact that the conduct involves nudity does not shed that protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="2705.787" offset="10957121">They've posited now their interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.258" offset="10967048">They are content-based interests, because they depend upon the impact of the speech on the audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.742" offset="10988990">Let me turn for a minute to a point that the State did not raise in its oral argument but did raise in its main brief here: their argument that this statute can really be justified as a Renton-type statute, aimed only at secondary effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.796" offset="11057222">I think that that argument is totally inapplicable here for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.239" offset="11087002">First, the ordinance in Renton by its terms focused only on secondary effects of certain specified businesses and did not prohibit or criminalize any expressive activity whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.230" offset="11150950">This statute, by its terms, does not even mention secondary effects, has nothing to do with businesses of any type, and does criminalize and prohibit expressive activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.708" offset="11204866">Second, controlling secondary effects was the actual purpose in Renton.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.542" offset="11228168">Here, as the State candidly acknowledges in its brief, it is only a quote, "possible hypothetical purpose".</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.776" offset="11261082">In Renton, it was clear that the Government was actually concerned with secondary effects and had reviewed studies and extensive evidence about that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.672" offset="11296713">Here the State does not claim that the legislature was actually concerned about secondary effects or reviewed any evidence, and in fact, it is highly implausible that the secondary effects associated with adult businesses was a problem or a concern when this statute was first enacted in 1881.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.237" offset="11374976">Furthermore, although the constitutionality of this statute has been before the Indiana Supreme Court on numerous occasions, the Indiana Supreme Court has never even hinted that the statute aims at secondary effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.963" offset="11425862">Finally, the State's briefs here make crystal clear that the interests the State is advancing focus on the impact of this speech on its audience, on the listeners' reactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.672" offset="11476749">Accordingly, this is a primary effects case, not a secondary effects case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.375" offset="11491482">One point I think is worth mentioning is that even if this decision is affirmed, the State of Indiana would be left with ample authority to regulate or perhaps prohibit nude dancing in a constitutional manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.303" offset="11591270">The State could certainly prohibit all obscene dancing, whether in public or in private.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.026" offset="11614153">It could... the State could certainly prohibit all obscene nude dancing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.998" offset="11637977">That would not be affected by affirmance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.762" offset="11649052">That State could certainly under the Twenty-first Amendment prohibit dancing where alcohol is served, whether the dancers are nude or clothed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.696" offset="11680817">The State could certainly regulate nude dancing under the Sable analysis in truly public places before unconsenting adults, captive audiences, or children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.244" offset="11727002">And finally, if secondary effects were in fact a problem, the State under Renton could even zone, so long as it was a true zoning ordinance and was not a prohibition of a category of speech.</text>

            <text syncTime="2932.136" offset="11862525">Miller and Sable go to great, great careful links of attempting to decide what forms of sexual conduct the State can prohibit and what it cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.642" offset="11904635">This is in effect and end run around Miller and Sable, because the State has conceded that this nude dancing is not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.007" offset="11930026">As Jenkins v. Georgia and other cases in this Court make clear, the mere fact of nudity does not equate with obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.802" offset="11961268">But here what the State is trying to do is without meeting the detailed requirements of the Miller test or the Sable test, nonetheless to categorically ban and eliminate an entire category of speech.</text>

            <text syncTime="2986.370" offset="12079446">In Miller, the third prong of the test, of course, is an artistic prong test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.484" offset="12095955">But that judgment is only reached once the court has already found that the speech is patently offensive and appeals to a prurient interest in sex and is, therefore, otherwise unprotected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.402" offset="12147573">The artistic merit test in Miller comes into save and give protection to speech that is otherwise unprotected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.688" offset="12176726">Here, the State, as Justice Kennedy's question suggests, would be striking out on very new ground indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.242" offset="12202953">Here the State would be saying that speech is only protected to begin with if it has artistic merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.174" offset="12222701">As this Court said in Hanaghan unanimously, what to one man is trash may to others have fleeting or even enduring values and it is not business of the State to determine which is trash and which is valuable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.723" offset="12280902">The First Amendment leaves that judgment to the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.095" offset="12290411">In fact as Justice Harlan wrote in Cohen v. California, one man's lyric is another's vulgarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.671" offset="12320713">And as Justice Harlan said, it is precisely because governments cannot make principal decisions between those kinds of communications, that the First Amendment leaves judgments in matters of taste to the individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="3069.866" offset="12413500">We believe the second issue presented in the petition is properly before the Court for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.108" offset="12430427">First, as Chief Justice Rehnquist pointed out, the issue was clearly raised in our petition for certiorari and there was no suggestion of waiver in the respondents' briefs in opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.655" offset="12468670">Second, the issue was fully decided by all of the judges of the Seventh Circuit below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.577" offset="12488315">Only one concurring judge, after addressing the merits, suggested that the issued may have been waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.462" offset="12507854">But he, too, joined the majority opinion in which the court clearly applied but found lacking our statute under the reasonable, time, place, and manner test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.317" offset="12543276">And finally, we believe the issue is fairly included within the first issue that's presented, that at... resolution to the First Amendment issue in this case would be unsatisfactory if the Court simply stopped at a determination of whether this activity is speech without also determining whether or not it's regulable under this statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3195.887" offset="12917559">--As a blanket prohibition, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.269" offset="12923097">As we suspected, the respondents have argued here today that basically any conduct anywhere that resembles dance is speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.807" offset="12961235">The burden is then on the State to justify our regulation of that conduct even if it's in a window in carwash, such as Justice Kennedy suggested, or out in the public park.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.422" offset="12999688">I don't think this Court has ever held that a State is required to come in with a common law crime that was in existence many, many years before the Constitution and the First Amendment were adopted and justify that statute as applied to live conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.890" offset="13057575">There's been quite a bit of discussion during Mr. Ennis' argument of the State's interest in this case, and we'll confess a handicap here and that is that Indiana does not record legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.558" offset="13100207">Therefore, to some extent when the Attorney General's office or even the Indiana Supreme Court suggests what the State's interests are in upholding this statute, the legislative intent is simply inferred there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.047" offset="13154228">There is no clear record of legislative intent in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.499" offset="13168021">But again we go back to the fact that this is a common law offense that involves traditional notions in our culture of what constitutes public decency in a public place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.165" offset="13206682">And when it comes down to the fine tuning what we find is not that the defendant... that the respondents have any problem with the statute or its goals, but simply they disagree with our definition of what is a public place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.853" offset="13253389">And that's a matter for the State courts and the legislature to determine and as long as that is a reasonable determination that is reasonably related to the goals of the statute, then the First Amendment does not prohibit the State of Indiana from enforcing this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.881" offset="13305529">Therefore, again, we would ask that the Seventh Circuit's invalidating of the statute be reversed and that the district court be affirmed.</text>
