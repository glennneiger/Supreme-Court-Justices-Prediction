            <text syncTime="1689.206" offset="6890505">The provision in this contract is an extremely broad one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.098" offset="6910149">It's not limited solely to questions of interpretation or application of the contract, but includes, quote,</text>

            <text syncTime="1729.053" offset="7049957">But our case is far stronger because I think I can demonstrate unequivocally that the parties, even based on the language of the contract in the Board's cases, intended that seniority would continue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2022.283" offset="8222855">The next step is to search within the agreement for some expressed exclusion or other forceful evidence that that particular dispute is not to be arbitrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.449" offset="8267472">In AT&amp;T Tech there was an express exclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2046.670" offset="8320448">But you can find no such exclusion clause in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.302" offset="8334972">There is nothing that Litton ever sought to exclude from arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.725" offset="8348660">Absent an exclusion clause, the only thing left for Litton to assert or the Board to assert would prevent arbitration is some forceful expression.</text>

            <text syncTime="2072.856" offset="8425147">And there the irony of the case is that the Board concedes that had the contract simply talked about seniority without aptitude and ability, it would be arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.962" offset="8461614">What the Board is trying to convince you is that the words "aptitude" and "ability" are tantamount to an express exclusion from arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="2385.509" offset="9675785">You can allege that the discharge 10 months later violated the agreement, and then presumably the court can hold yes, you're entitled to have that arbitrated because you have alleged that it violates the agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3127.778" offset="12644863">For example, the common area where it occurs is in cost of living increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.519" offset="12663775">The union recognizes that COLA's may not be applicable after the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.643" offset="12680285">There are cases where... for example this contract illustrates it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.867" offset="12697212">There is an explicit provision that provides that the health and welfare... I'm sorry, the pension contribution... the health and welfare contribution amount lasts until 9 months after the contract expires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.491" offset="12735664">It says that the level of contribution will be $55 until July of 1988, which was some 9 months after the initial contract had expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.968" offset="12773594">So the parties dealt with that problem of defining what their obligation would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.611" offset="12788118">And then they later changed the amount of pension contribution and increased it just a month before the contract had expired, obviously I think anticipating that when the contract had expired they would bargain from that level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.058" offset="12833989">Now the parties could well have said that with the expiration of the contract the employer will cease contributing to the union's trust fund, because the parties had contemplated that with the next agreement they would substitute a new health and welfare or pension program.</text>

            <text syncTime="3188.737" offset="12888637">Mr. Rosenfeld, can you argue in this case, does it help your case to say that the Board is inconsistent in ordering steps one and two of the grievance process, but not the arbitration process?</text>

            <text syncTime="3202.978" offset="12945689">It's not only inconsistent, Your Honor, it puts the union at a severe disadvantage because presumably during that period when we have to go through steps 1 and 2, we can't take economic action, while the Board says theoretically we can at some other point, and that process could be dragged out for some period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.518" offset="13011831">But more importantly, going through steps 1 and 2 in this case is a useless exercise because all we do is go to the employer and if he rejects it, that's the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.294" offset="13046939">And even Chairman Dotson in his dissent in Indiana &amp; Michigan said that it's like truncating this well-crafted grievance and arbitration procedure to say that there is some obligation to go through the first part of it but not the last part.</text>

            <text syncTime="3248.226" offset="13126665">It also creates another severe anomaly, which is that there are many grievance procedures which provide for joint adjustment boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.970" offset="13153624">The Gateway Coal case gives a very good example where there are five intermediate... five initial steps, and then a joint adjustment board composed of union officials from another union and mine officials from another mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.008" offset="13197718">And we don't know whether the Board is telling us that that step, which is like arbitration for some purposes and unlike arbitration for other purposes, is governed by this doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.953" offset="13233558">And yet that... and then that mineworker contract provides that there's finally a step, which is at that joint board, which is very common to contracts but not here, the final step is arbitration before a neutral party who renders a binding decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3301.030" offset="13337839">And once again, Chief Justice Rehnquist, when you dissented in Nolde you did for one strong... there were two reasons, but the primary reason was because of this note of the strike problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.145" offset="13370335">And a year later the Board in Goya Foods said that we will imply the continued obligation not to strike over arbitrable grievances, and we accept that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3321.483" offset="13419655">The union filed a grievance asserting that the layoffs were unjust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.875" offset="13433238">We asked for the benefit of our bargain, which was to go to the arbitrator and have the arbitrator make the determination whether those grievances violated the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.523" offset="13471795">The employer refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.122" offset="13478169">We didn't want to make the arguments about the language of the contract to the Board, and I surely don't want to make those arguments to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.038" offset="13505859">Because what the Board tells us and what this Court has told us since Warrior &amp; Gulf is that those arguments as to the meaning of the layoff clause, the meaning of seniority, and whether the parties intended that language to continue, those are arguments to be made to the arbitrator and not to the court and not to the Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="3368.323" offset="13607005">On page 58 in Indiana &amp; Michigan the Board specifically said that it has concluded that Katz should not apply to post-expiration withdrawal from arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.715" offset="13664579">And that is a matter that goes to the Board's core expertise in interpreting and applying the act itself that the union is taking issue with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.641" offset="13708255">We have mentioned in our reply brief some of the pitfalls of extending Katz to this area, and we think the Board's determination there is entitled to deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.246" offset="13750678">In... we disagree also that if the Board, in reading the arbitration provisions, concludes that a matter would have been arbitrable before expiration, that necessarily means the Board has to conclude that it would be arbitrable after expiration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.871" offset="13829255">If any claim invoking a provision of the contract were arbitrable, that would mean if an employee was hired after the contract expired and then discharged several months later, still during the hiatus period, his discharge would be arbitrable, even though he never worked under the contract while it was in effect.</text>
