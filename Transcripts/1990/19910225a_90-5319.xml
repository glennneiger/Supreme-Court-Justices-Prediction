            <label>Mr. Gary M. Luck</label>
            <text syncTime="30.434" offset="255752">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="34.517" offset="272052">The relevant facts in this case are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.458" offset="287830">I would like to outline them briefly and then propose three scenarios that support McNeil's proposed rule that a defendant who requests or appears with counsel at an initial appearance may not be questioned by police while he remains in continuance custody unless the defendant initiates that interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.612" offset="368392">The defendant was taken into custody on May 13th, 1987 in Omaha.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.483" offset="391902">That was pursuant to a Milwaukee, Wisconsin warrant and complaint for an armed robbery which had occurred in the Milwaukee jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.291" offset="423144">He waived extradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.913" offset="433593">On May 20th, after being held in continuous custody in Omaha, he was taken into custody by two Milwaukee deputy sheriff detectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.779" offset="469120">At the time that they took him into custody, they advised him of his Miranda rights from a written text which is used by the sheriff's department... that's in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.137" offset="518543">And one of the rights read to him was if you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you at public expense before or during any questioning if you so choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.505" offset="560026">McNeil refused to make a statement at that time and did not request counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.899" offset="585521">He was accompanied by officers that day in a search of Omaha for a codefendant which was unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.682" offset="612689">On May 21st, McNeil was transferred to the Omaha Airport for conveyance back to Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.376" offset="635468">During that transportation, Detective Smukowski of the Milwaukee Sheriff's Department advised McNeil that it would be to his advantage if he would tell his side of the story referring to the armed robbery and to a homicide investigation which was taking place involving a Milwaukee County Sheriff by the name of Butts and the Caledonia Police Department, which is part of Racine County, a separate jurisdiction from Milwaukee County.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.783" offset="741107">Smukowski, after advising McNeil that it would be in his interest to cooperate and tell his side of the stories, was met by a silence from the part of McNeil.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.822" offset="785306">He did not make any statements concerning either of those offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.224" offset="802860">McNeil was returned to Milwaukee on the evening of the 21st.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.558" offset="820205">The following morning, May 22nd, which was a Friday, he was brought before a court commissioner, a judicial officer, and with him at that time was a public defender.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.776" offset="869107">When McNeil appeared at the initial appearance, he was advised of the penalties for armed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.860" offset="897423">He acknowledged it by saying, I do, when he was asked if he understood, and those are the only words he spoke at that initial appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.106" offset="926367">Bail was set at $25,000 and a preliminary examination was set.</text>

            <text syncTime="204.600" offset="952385">That's the appearance of May 22nd that's set forth in the... joint appendix at page 8?</text>

            <label>Mr. Gary M. Luck</label>
            <text syncTime="210.253" offset="974955">That's correct, Justice Kennedy.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="211.453" offset="979761">Is it... is it the practice in this State for magistrates to advise suspects generally of their rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="220.118" offset="1014452">I see that wasn't done here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gary_m_luck" startTime="221.890" stopTime="236.640">
            <label>Mr. Gary M. Luck</label>
            <text syncTime="221.890" offset="1021557">No, unfortunately, because of the crush of cases in Milwaukee County, sometimes the niceties of informing defendants of their full panoply of rights, which they might get from a Federal magistrate, do not take place.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="236.640" stopTime="238.631">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="236.640" offset="1080490">Is there any requirement in the Wisconsin statute--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gary_m_luck" startTime="238.631" stopTime="239.112">
            <label>Mr. Gary M. Luck</label>
            <text syncTime="238.631" offset="1088535">Yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="239.112" stopTime="241.583">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="239.112" offset="1090416">--that this be done by the arraigning officer?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gary_m_luck" startTime="241.583" stopTime="424.752">
            <label>Mr. Gary M. Luck</label>
            <text syncTime="241.583" offset="1100343">There are requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.594" offset="1104313">But one of the requirements does not include... I ought to rephrase that... the magistrate is not required to advise the defendant of his right to remain silent at that initial appearance, unlike under Rule 5 in the Federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.522" offset="1156036">The magistrate is suppose to advise the defendant of the charges against him, of his right to counsel, to set bail, his right to a preliminary examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.527" offset="1192085">And if you will look at the text of that initial appearance, you'll notice that there's really a colloquy that goes on between defense counsel and the magistrate and the only participation of the defendant is to acknowledge what he has been charged with.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.777" offset="1249032">The... to push that a little further, Your Honor, the public defender has a meeting with the defendants in Milwaukee County prior to their appearance... at the initial appearance, albeit a perfunctory meeting in a small room off to the side.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.557" offset="1312248">And we can presume that that occurred before the appearance before the magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.742" offset="1340983">After this exchange took place, McNeil was returned to the Milwaukee County jail where he was held continuously until that evening at 7:55 p.m. when Detective Butts of the Milwaukee Sheriff's Department went to see McNeil for the purposes of interrogating him about the armed robbery, and according to his testimony, possibly the homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.218" offset="1438890">Keep in mind that Detective Butts had been involved in a homicide investigation from another jurisdiction, that is, Racine County, because he had informants apparently that led him to believe that McNeil was involved in that Racine homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.529" offset="1504091">As a result, Detective Butts was in communication with police authorities from Racine County concerning that homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.895" offset="1533557">So when he went to see McNeil that evening at 7:55 p.m. at the Milwaukee County jail, I think they can say to a certainty that he went there to speak to him about the armed robbery and the homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.823" offset="1585280">When he arrived, he again read from the standard Milwaukee County Sheriff's Department text concerning Miranda rights, which is in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.188" offset="1618717">At this time, McNeil signed a waiver of his rights and said to Butts, I suppose you want to talk about that thing in Caledonia.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.514" offset="1659990">And of course, Butts said yes, and they had a conversation about the Caledonia homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.288" offset="1683082">Didn't discuss the armed robbery, and at that time McNeil gave a statement that was totally exculpatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.313" offset="1715265">Detective Butts testified that he informed McNeil that he wasn't satisfied with what he had been told and that he would return.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.538" offset="1748075">He returned 2 days later on a Sunday in the early evening hours with a representative of the Caledonia Department who had primary jurisdiction of the homicide together with, between three or four City of Milwaukee... not County of Milwaukee... City of Milwaukee detectives from the homicide division with expertise in the area of homicide interrogation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="424.752" stopTime="427.754">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="424.752" offset="1833025">Did the robbery take place in the City of Milwaukee?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gary_m_luck" startTime="427.754" stopTime="454.363">
            <label>Mr. Gary M. Luck</label>
            <text syncTime="427.754" offset="1844937">It took place in a suburb called West Allis, a city adjacent to Milwaukee but part of Milwaukee County, which gave jurisdiction to the Sheriff's Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.641" offset="1880568">Ordinarily you'd think that maybe West Allis police would be involved, but because it was in the county the Sheriff was... and that's how Butts got involved in the homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.827" offset="1917244">Apparently in developing his investigation of the armed robbery, he received information concerning the homicide passed out to Caledonia and remained active.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="454.363" stopTime="457.455">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="454.363" offset="1951412">And the homicide had occurred in Caledonia in Racine County?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gary_m_luck" startTime="457.455" stopTime="662.300">
            <label>Mr. Gary M. Luck</label>
            <text syncTime="458.406" offset="1967608">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.738" offset="1972937">On the 24th, after 5 hours of... approximately 5 hours of meeting in the early to late evening with these various agencies, McNeil made a statement that was heavily inculpatory, partially exculpatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.659" offset="2040646">Butts was still not satisfied, said he was going to come back again, and he returned 2 days later on a Tuesday again with approximately three or four officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.705" offset="2072829">Took another statement after approximately an hour and a half which he felt was... sewed up the case, let's say.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.799" offset="2101146">Consequent... or subsequent to that, Racine County issued a homicide warrant on May 27th and Mr. McNeil was transferred from the Milwaukee facility to Racine, where he was subsequently arraigned, and subsequently, after various motions to suppress the statements which I've alluded to were denied, he entered pleas to charges of second-degree murder, attempted murder, and armed burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.190" offset="2226743">After that, motions were brought to bring to the trial court's attention the Seventh Circuit case of Espinoza v. Fairman, which I don't think it's necessary for me to go into facts, except to say that there's a tremendous similarity between the two fact situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.540" offset="2292153">And at that time, Fairman held that the kinds of statements that had been developed in McNeil should have been suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.236" offset="2326948">The trial court felt that even if that case had been brought to its attention during the pending case, it would have had the... it would have made the same decision that the statements needn't have been suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.134" offset="2382537">The case was then appealed to the intermediate appeals level in Wisconsin, which certified to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, because they felt there was no applicable Wisconsin law.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.602" offset="2428408">The Wisconsin Supreme Court, after full briefing and oral argument, felt that when McNeil appeared at the initial appearance, it was purely a Sixth Amendment right to counsel that he had invoked when he appeared with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.983" offset="2493923">They use the word transmutation, and they say that it is not possible to transmutate the Sixth Amendment into the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.130" offset="2530494">And the reasoning was that they felt that there was no interrogation taking place at the initial appearance, and in the absence of interrogation, you cannot invoke your Fifth Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.996" offset="2581903">Your Honor, we believe that there's three scenarios that support the rule that we're proposing.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.464" offset="2623804">The first is, if Mr. McNeil, when he was confronted by the Milwaukee sheriffs in Omaha on May 20th, 1987, had, after being advised of his rights, said, I want an attorney, I don't think we'd be here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.544" offset="2688170">And I think the State and the United States would agree under the Edwards and the Roberson doctrines.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.299" offset="2715128">A second scenario is when the police from Milwaukee approached Mr. McNeil, if he, sui sponte, without being informed by the police of his Miranda rights, had said, I want an attorney, I don't think we would be here today.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="662.300" stopTime="665.662">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="662.300" offset="2783151">None of those... neither of those scenarios happened, did they?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gary_m_luck" startTime="665.662" stopTime="735.349">
            <label>Mr. Gary M. Luck</label>
            <text syncTime="665.662" offset="2796630">Absolutely not, Judge, they did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.285" offset="2803108">What did happen was an invocation of right to counsel with a variation in time and a variation in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.799" offset="2837172">The difference is, is that McNeil waited until he was in Milwaukee to have counsel and it took place at an initial appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.323" offset="2867265">And we have built our case, Your Honor, around the Edwards-Roberson doctrine as amplified by Michigan v. Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.441" offset="2915748">There is a footnote which appears in our briefs, footnote 7, where in Jackson this Court said that jurists may understand the subtle distinctions between the Fifth and Sixth Amendment, but when an average person invokes his right to counsel, he does not know which constitutional right his invocation rests upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.319" offset="3015223">All he knows when he invokes his right to counsel, whether it's in front of a magistrate or a police officer, is that he needs the assistance of counsel to stand between him and his adversaries, be they the prosecutor or the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.828" offset="3073319">So that's--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="735.349" stopTime="742.482">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="735.349" offset="3075409">Suppose a suspect, after being advised of his rights says, I want a counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.851" offset="3093381">I want an attorney; but I'm pleased to talk with you now.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gary M. Luck</label>
            <text syncTime="742.482" offset="3103934">--Well, I think that if... if we take Connecticut v. Earrett, which really doesn't amplify it... restates the rule in Jackson that the request for counsel should be given a broad rather than a narrow interpretation and that it... that if there's a plain meaning to the defendant's invocation, we don't have to move to that type of interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.830" offset="3221277">Therefore, as in Connecticut and Barrett where the person said, I'll give you an oral statement, but I want a counsel for a written statement, the court said, well, that's plain on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.308" offset="3255236">We don't have to interpret that.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.927" offset="3261714">So if a suspect says, I want an attorney, but I want to talk to you, the plain meaning there would be, I want to talk to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.493" offset="3287941">But if said, I want an attorney, I think you have to stop right there, because you have to give it its broadest interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.066" offset="3318243">That's not the scenario in this case, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.258" offset="3330991">The scenario in this case is that the defendant appeared in court with his counsel, and I think that his mere appearance--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="808.375" offset="3367458">Well, the principle is that the mere request for or invocation of right to counsel is not in all respects tantamount to an exercise of your Fifth Amendment rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1546.621" offset="6320444">Before I proceed to the argument that I prepared to present this morning, I think I want to clear up one thing with respect to our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.105" offset="6358374">Mr. Luck asserts that our position would forbid an invocation of the Fifth Amendment right to counsel which would thereby trigger the Edwards rule at a court appearance on a charged defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.663" offset="6408633">I think that mischaracterizes our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.025" offset="6418037">And in making that characterization of our position, he attempts to drive a wedge between our position and the position of the Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.222" offset="6462863">Our position, I think, and the Solicitor General's position really... those two positions are identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.398" offset="6491598">All we're saying is that if a defendant makes an appearance with an attorney at a hearing on a charged offense, he does not thereby or as I think is stated in the brief of the Solicitor General, he does not by that fact alone invoke his Fifth Amendment right to counsel so as to trigger the Edwards rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.424" offset="6595670">We are not suggesting that a defendant could not, if he clearly stated, I am not comfortable in dealing with the police in a custodial interrogation situation, and I want an attorney present whenever I am interrogated... we're not suggesting that that kind of a request could not come at any stage of his being in custody whether that be when he's in the custody of police officers or when he's in court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2198.316" offset="8927255">And while I don't think it's possible in the time that I have remaining here in my argument probably to fully develop the question, it seems to me that in deciding whether or not there is... a showing has been made that the rule should be extended so that Edwards... Edwards-Roberson rule should apply in this situation whether your request for counsel comes not in the context of custodian interrogation but rather in the context of a court appearance, that the... and... and when that request for counsel then is going to bar interrogation with respect to uncharged offenses, I think that what this Court has to do is basically a cost-benefit analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.535" offset="9104157">And I don't think that once you weigh the costs against the benefits that you really will find a persuasive case made for the extension that is being sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.700" offset="9140728">And in that regard, I'd like to address the two... the two prongs of that analysis... the costs and the benefits of an extension of the Edwards-Roberson rule to the present situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.857" offset="9185345">The costs we would submit would be exceedingly high.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.120" offset="9198406">As a practical matter what you would be basically holding is once a defendant is charged with a crime, he is, from that point on, off limits to police-initiated interrogation as long as he remains in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.147" offset="9250547">And he's off limits to police-initiated interrogation not only with respect to that charged crime, but also with respect to any other crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.722" offset="9276878">And why do I say that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.304" offset="9283148">I say that because almost immediately after a charge is made you're going to have an invocation of the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.768" offset="9313032">And you're going to have that invocation in one of two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.680" offset="9324734">You're either going to have it the way it was done here where you have a public defender system in place that basically provides attorneys who will make an appearance at the initial court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.957" offset="9365799">And that will obviously have to be deemed an invocation of the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.781" offset="9381054">Or you'll have the situation that you have in other States where you do not have a public defender system in place necessarily or the public defender does not arrive on the scene quite as quickly as he does in Wisconsin, where you'll have a court making inquiry at initial appearance as to the defendant's wishes with regard to counsel which will, in the normal course, it would seem to me, invoke a request for counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.858" offset="9477394">And so, as a practical matter as I indicated, what you're going to be doing is you're going to be saying that as soon as a defendant is charged with a crime, he is going to become off limits for police-initiated interrogation with respect to any offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2473.165" offset="10026592">And if they arrest him on the minor offense first in order to get him into custody where they can interrogate him more effectively on the second crime, then it's advantageous for law enforcement purposes to be able to do that without having to notify counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.033" offset="10074135">That's what they do, as I understand it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2515.264" offset="10195030">I mean they'd have... they'd have to have probable cause to arrest him on that second offense, and which he may be nothing more than a suspect which of course raises the whole problem of whether or not it's not in the defendant's interest perhaps to have... to be questioned about these other crimes that he's suspected of, because he may be able to clear himself of all suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.902" offset="10257619">The... the situation in that regard, by the way, that a... that a suspect charged with one offense may well turn out to be a... a person charged with one offense may turn out to be a suspect in other offenses, I think has only become exacerbated as we see the... with the advent of these computerized fingerprint matching systems which I think are going to result in even more cases in... in which we are able to, as a result of arrest on one charge and... and bringing him to... and bringing those charges before the court, we are going to find out that this fellow may have been involved in other activity about which we would want to question him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.044" offset="10390112">And what the... what the defendant's proposed extension of... of the Edwards rule would do then would be, in this kind of a situation that I have described, would be to borrow what this Court has labeled absolutely essential activity in the enforcement of our criminal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.274" offset="10443089">The essential activity being noncoercive questioning in counsel's absence with a view toward obtaining a voluntary statement where the defendant admits his guilt of the crime of which he's suspected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.734" offset="10500872">Now, that interference might be tolerable if there was a significant benefit to be gained by the extension of the rule that the defendant proposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.870" offset="10537443">And our position would be that there really is not much of a benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.771" offset="10557087">The Edwards rule is... is designed to protect against police badgering.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.624" offset="10576418">I think the apparent concern of this Court... it was certainly the concern that Justice Kennedy identified as the apparent concern of this Court in his dissent in Roberson... is that if you... if you go ahead an interrogate the guy after he's requested an attorney... and we're talking about a situation in Edwards where he requested an attorney during the course of custodial interrogation... if you go ahead and reinitiate interrogation, the defendant is going to wonder, do I really have a right to counsel?</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.109" offset="10670354">I mean didn't I invoke this right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.351" offset="10675370">Why didn't that result in something?</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.653" offset="10680594">Why isn't that attorney here now to assist me?</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.034" offset="10690103">Why are they starting this questioning over again?</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.974" offset="10697835">I don't think that describes how a defendant would view the situation when he has appeared in court with counsel on a charged offense, and then the police approach him to interrogate him with respect to a completely separate and distinct offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.835" offset="10757290">I don't think he perceives that as being inconsistent with what happened there in court, because I think a normal defendant perceives that what happened there in court was that he had the... an attorney to represent him on that charged offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.563" offset="10804205">And... and I don't think he perceives it to be inconsistent when he is questioned about completely separate and distinct offenses that that... he does not perceive that to be inconsistent with his appearance with counsel on the charged offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2686.005" offset="10877975">And with the terrific cost in terms of the detriment on effective law enforcement, I don't think a case can be made for an extension of the Edwards rule in the manner in which the defendant has requested--</text>

            <text syncTime="2714.472" offset="10991869">The issue here is... is we believe is more narrow than some of the discussion has indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.507" offset="11019977">It is whether anything that happened in petitioner's first appearance... a first appearance that is fairly typical of proceedings that occur many, many times each day around the United States... is fairly regarded as a basis for triggering Edwards no-waiver presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.750" offset="11096986">We submit that there is no basis for the triggering of Edwards in this situation for two basic reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.426" offset="11127706">First, applying a presumption that an otherwise valid waiver of Miranda rights is a product of coercion is not necessary in this situation to protect the individual's free exercise of his privilege against compelled self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.987" offset="11197923">And that after all is the purpose of all the Miranda rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.011" offset="11214014">Secondly, that sort of a rule would needlessly undercut the other interest which factors into the Miranda complex and that is the public's interest in the effective investigation of... of crimes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2866.444" offset="11599791">It's important, I think, to recognize that Edwards is a... is a rather extraordinary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.667" offset="11624659">It provides that an otherwise completely valid waiver of a Miranda right to counsel is rendered invalid by virtue of the circumstances that have occurred before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.036" offset="11682129">And for that reason, we think it's important to limit the Edwards rules to those situations in which it can fairly be said that something has occurred to cast doubt on the defendant or the suspect's ability to exercise his free choice when he is given Miranda warnings and simply asked, are you prepared to talk to us without a lawyer present?</text>

            <label>Mr. Gary M. Luck</label>
            <text syncTime="3294.914" offset="13313632">Both the United States and the State of Wisconsin it seems to petitioner, disregard of one of the fundamental purposes of Miranda, which is to deal with the question of custody and the resulting coercive atmosphere that results from custody when it's put in the interrogation setting, and which this Court most recently recognized in Minnick.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.692" offset="13412689">The fact of the matter is that once the defendant is arraigned or appears at an initial appearance and has bail set and he's indigent... and for all practical purposes, McNeil was never going to make bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.918" offset="13461590">He was indigent and he had $25,000 bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.521" offset="13472039">It's unrealistic to think that the... the continued custody doesn't work on an increased coercive effect on the ability to exercise the free will to speak or not to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.070" offset="13526269">He is not in the same position as a suspect in the police station who has just been arrested, who still has the ability to not be charged and to go home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.866" offset="13569423">He already is incarcerated, no different than if he had been found guilty, except that he's awaiting trial and he has a presumption of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.782" offset="13597113">But he's being treated like a prisoner who's already been found guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.595" offset="13612369">And he is sitting in that jail cell and police are coming to see him on two or three different occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.637" offset="13632535">Now, Miranda recognizes that, and Miranda said that if the suspect indicates in any manner at any time prior to or during interrogation that he wishes counsel, there shall be no interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.054" offset="13678197">Well, he indicated in a manner that he wanted counsel when he appeared at the initial appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.159" offset="13702648">As far as costs and benefits are concerned, it's... it's the petitioner's position that the net of the Roberson and Edwards is much greater than the net of what we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.277" offset="13759072">If they talk about the number of individuals who have been charged who could be interrogated in the jail because they've committed other offenses, think of all those individuals who were in the police station who've invoked their right to counsel and cannot be questioned any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.586" offset="13816333">I don't know what the statistics are, but we know it's a pyramid and the number of people who are taken into custody are not equal to the number of people who appear in court and they have bail set.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.393" offset="13863562">I think it's also unrealistic to say that individuals want an opportunity to explain to the police when they're sitting in a jail cell about how they weren't involved in a particular offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.355" offset="13919360">The fact of the matter is is that this Court has recognized that counsel is needed in the custodial setting as a guiding hand to assist individuals, to enable them to decide whether or not they want to respond to questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.882" offset="13973485">The fact of the matter is, is that defense attorneys are not necessarily the manipulators that counsel indicates they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.049" offset="14010161">I mean this Court is well aware that defense counsel can also serve as facilitators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.781" offset="14029074">When the police know that they have other crimes, they contact the district attorney, who contacts the defense attorney, who says, you know, we've got other information on your guy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.027" offset="14066063">Why don't you go talk to him?</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.359" offset="14071392">And you know something, that happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.400" offset="14079543">Because sometimes the defense attorney can advise and consult with his client and do him more good sometimes to have him cooperate, than when he tells him not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.685" offset="14116741">And it's done in an orderly fashion where fundamental rights under the Constitution are abided by.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.028" offset="14138057">And they don't take place in jail cells when the defendant's attorney are not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.193" offset="14162717">Finally, we feel that the... the rule of Roberson and Edwards is really what opposition is arguing against, because what we're talking about is really when counsel is invoked and--</text>
