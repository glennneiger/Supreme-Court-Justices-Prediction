            <text syncTime="70.758" offset="413910">And he also stated that the right to protect one's reputation is a fundamental right within the concept of liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.851" offset="442332">Fifty years earlier in a case called Adams v. Turner, a 1917 case, this Court stated something very similar when it said that when you take the property upon which my house sits, you take my house, and when you take the means whereby I live, you take my life.</text>

            <text syncTime="1540.206" offset="6291775">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.322" offset="6320196">In Harlow against Fitzgerald this Court held that a plaintiff in a Bivens action cannot overcome the defense of qualified immunity, and therefore, proceed with the litigation by alleging that the official acted with malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.530" offset="6368993">The question presented here is whether the plaintiff may do so where malice or improper motive happens to be an element of the constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.076" offset="6403161">In our view in the face of the qualified immunity defense, general allegations of malice do not entitle the plaintiff to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.183" offset="6435657">Where malice or improper motive is an element of the constitutional claim, the plaintiff, in order to avoid dismissal, must allege specific facts that call into question the objective reasonableness of the official's challenged conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.122" offset="6499396">This requirement which may be... this so-called particularity requirement, which stems from the Court's recent immunity decisions in Harlow, Mitchell against Forsyth, and Anderson against Creighton, ensures that the defense of qualified immunity in these particular lawsuits retains its substantive scope and effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1613.627" offset="6585391">Well, Mr. Chief Justice, in strict terms it really isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.760" offset="6601901">The... calling it a pleading requirement I think has caused more confusion than is necessary, because under the Federal rules, a plaintiff can... under Rule 8 and Rule 9, a plaintiff can file a rather barebones complaint and can allege... and we don't challenge this... can allege malice in general terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.993" offset="6682880">But the landscape changes once the Federal official, if he so chooses, raises the defense of qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.388" offset="6716421">And that... that changes, in our... in our view, how this is resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.332" offset="6740245">Now, in this particular case, because both... excuse me... the court of appeals and the district court should have and actually did consider matters that were not in the complaint, it becomes a summary judgment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.990" offset="6794893">And therefore, to say that... and some courts have suggested this but not really held it, that all this has to be in the complaint is I think misleading.</text>
