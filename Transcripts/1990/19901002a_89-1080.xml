            <text syncTime="578.911" offset="2447451">Based on fundamental principles previously announced by this Court in the desegregation context, we believe that unitarianist must mean that the constitutional violation has been eliminated, and therefore control over the schools should be returned to the board of education.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.920" offset="2507533">We believe that it means the desegregation decree should be lifted, and at that time the school board should be returned to the same status as any other school board, thereby being governed by traditional equal protection principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.180" offset="2564480">Now, the unitarianist finding in Oklahoma City came 16 years after this suit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.665" offset="2586423">Although the case was filed in 1961, and the school board first used busing as an aid to integration in 1965, it was not until 1 year after Swann that a comprehensive plan was implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.575" offset="2638145">In 1972, Judge Bohanon ordered the school board to implement the Finger Plan, which employed the techniques of pairing, clustering, and massive cross-town busing to integrate all the schools in Oklahoma City.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.616" offset="2686315">The board of education appealed that order, and the circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.001" offset="2699794">Thus, under the rationale of Spangler, it became the law of this case that the Finger Plan constituted a race-neutral and constitutional method of pupil assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.107" offset="2740232">In 1977, Judge Bohanon, pursuant to a motion by the board, entered his order terminating the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.863" offset="2767295">That order did find that the school district had achieved unitariness after 16 years and terminated all further jurisdiction in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="712.915" offset="2983484">But I would agree with you that it wasn't until 1972 that a comprehensive plan was implemented to dismantle the dual system.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.686" offset="3018593">After the school board was found unitary in 1977, it elected to voluntarily continue to follow the plan, and it did that for 8 more years until a committee study revealed that demographic changes had rendered the plan inequitable at the elementary level.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.184" offset="3100513">It was at that time that the board decided to implement the neighborhood school plan for grades 1 through 4 only.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.504" offset="3129770">It does, to this day, continue to bus students in grades 5 through 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.741" offset="3150772">Judge Bohanon, who by the way has lived with this case since its inception, found that this plan was adopted by the board for legitimate, nondiscriminatory purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.132" offset="3192359">First, to reduce the busing burdens on young black children on Oklahoma City.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.667" offset="3210436">Second, to stop the threat of school closures in the black community.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.571" offset="3230080">Third, to increase the level of parental and community involvement in the public schools, which had been lacking.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.975" offset="3255680">And finally, to give these youngsters more time to participate in extracurricular activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.879" offset="3275324">Now, Judge Bohanon acknowledged that in the 1960's, as you pointed out, Justice Stevens, this board was recalcitrant, and he butted heads with the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.800" offset="3306984">But in his recent decisions he has clearly pointed out that the present board of education, and the board that was in power when his plan was implemented, was a totally different board with totally different attitudes.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.959" offset="3355677">His findings must be given due deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.911" offset="3367484">He's lived with this case since 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.444" offset="3377620">He is most familiar with the on-the-spot conditions in this case, and his findings, on this record, must be given due consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.100" offset="3412206">I would also point out that Judge Bohanon noted that in Oklahoma City the manner in which pupils are assigned to schools is no longer determined by race.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.425" offset="3453479">Rather, it's determined on the race-neutral method of where the children live, and Judge Bohanon felt that it was very important that this school board had implemented a transfer policy... it's called a majority-to-minority transfer policy... which allowed any student in a school which was racially identifiable to transfer to a school which was more integrated, and the School District picks up the cost of transportation in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.273" offset="3548878">So today, in Oklahoma City, no child is compelled to attend school by virtue of race, and the important thing today is that parents of all races have a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.998" offset="3591824">Judge Bohanon also found that the school board had maintained its unitary status from 1977 to date.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.569" offset="3622126">In this case, we had three findings of unitariness: one in 1977, one in 1985, and another in 1987, all made by Judge Bohanon based on the circumstances in Oklahoma City.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="1088.309" offset="4485002">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.629" offset="4502348">Over a generation ago this Court handed down its landmark decisions in Brown v. Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.002" offset="4543830">In its second decision in that case, the Court made clear that the Federal courts are duty bound to employ their broad, remedial powers to vindicate the rights of school children guaranteed by the equal protection clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.363" offset="4613211">Now 35 years after Brown II, literally hundreds of school districts across the country continue to operate under Federal court decrees, many of which were entered in the late 1960's and the early 1970's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.742" offset="4686772">Indeed, the United States is a party to almost 500 such cases across the Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.198" offset="4716552">Throughout this long process of desegregation, this Court and the lower Federal courts have proceeded on the basis of an assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.156" offset="4760437">The assumption is that Federal judicial power terminates when it has achieved its purpose, and that purpose is when a previously unconstitutional dual system has been dismantled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.646" offset="4818429">That assumption, we believe, is sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.531" offset="4829923">It was an assumption expressly contemplated in Brown II itself, where the Court spoke of the process of federal court supervision being a transitional one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.341" offset="4881123">And this much seems to us clear, notwithstanding the court of appeals' view to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.579" offset="4906096">But the court of appeals' error, with all respect, which seems clear enough, should not obscure the real difficulty that is confronting the lower courts in these cases; and that is, as the questions this morning have suggested, when has a unitary system been achieved?</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.008" offset="4991882">That threshold question is one that we believe deserves to be answered for the benefit of those hundreds of school districts and for the guidance of the courts of appeals and United States district courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.852" offset="5047157">In our view, this Court's decision over 20 years ago in Green v. County School Board points the way most clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.642" offset="5094387">There, the Court, speaking through Justice Brennan, looked to the six components of a school system ranging from student assignment and faculty hiring and staff hiring to physical facilities, extracurricular activities, and transportation to see whether racial discrimination has been eradicated root and branch from the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.841" offset="5195115">How does a system come into compliance with the Green factors?</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.329" offset="5217162">In our view, the principal way is by the good-faith compliance with a desegregation plan that has after all been put in place for the very purpose of achieving unitariness, of effecting a dismantling of the dual system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1289.540" offset="5289992">Well, General Starr, how does a school district eliminate the last vestiges of discrimination when residential segregation remains a reality and when at some point in the past the segregated schools may have contributed to that residential segregation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.274" offset="5392914">How do you deal with that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.893" offset="5407334">It seems to me that may be the crux of the problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1322.112" offset="5420291">Justice O'Connor, I think Green itself suggests that factors such as residential segregation cannot in any meaningful sense be considered a vestige once... once there has been good-faith compliance with a desegregation plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.579" offset="5518093">We look to the components of the school system over which a school board and school authorities have control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.566" offset="5550067">For obvious reasons, as this Court has noted in Swann, as it noted more emphatically in Spangler, the school board has no realistic control over where people determine to live.</text>

            <text syncTime="1375.096" offset="5632196">I believe that once there has been a desegregation plan that has been operating on the short side for 3 years... the Fifth Circuit's decision in the Youngblood case suggests that as a minimum... once that has been in effect for a substantial period of time, then, yes, I think that the board has done all that it realistically can as long as it does not violate the Constitution by any action outside the plan that might in fact contribute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="1414.389" offset="5789349">It certainly accomplished the dismantling of a school assignment or student assignment plan that was infected with invidious racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.245" offset="5832816">It took down, in effect, the signs over school doors that labeled schools on racial grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.868" offset="5863223">It also, by virtue of other factors as well, contributed to what the district judge found to be very substantial residential integration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1442.441" offset="5901571">And yet, we have 11 schools that will become black again, and they're the same schools that were black before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.544" offset="5926021">So it would seem to me either that busing didn't work at all or that it has to continue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1454.781" offset="5950890">--Well, I think it worked in the sense of dismantlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.400" offset="5961443">That is to say, it took the official sanction of the State's imprimatur away from that school, and there are now assignments on the basis of residence and not race, and coupled... and I think this is important, this Court emphasized its importance in Swann... with a majority-to-minority transfer program which assures that any school child in Oklahoma City can attend another school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.801" offset="6066978">No one is assigned on grounds of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.836" offset="6075128">And I think ultimately the difficulty with, if I may say so, undue emphasis upon the numbers is that, first of all, it goes beyond, quite beyond, what Swann itself contemplated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.977" offset="6127686">It contemplated numbers as a starting point in fashioning a desegregation plan, not at the end of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.649" offset="6158406">That starting point in Oklahoma City was 18 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.018" offset="6175856">Counting by race is something that is a very serious act for this State to do, and it should not, in fact, do that once a desegregation plan has been in effect and has, in fact, been efficacious.</text>

            <text syncTime="2022.500" offset="8221766">The court said simply it found that through the use of the Finger Plan the board had desegregated students and teachers and had eliminated other discriminatory practices in the system.</text>

            <text syncTime="2073.616" offset="8426253">We certainly do not have the court dismissing the injunction in 1977, so that injunction remains in effect: continue to use the Finger Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.658" offset="8462406">And in 1987 when the court was looking at the system and said that the system was unitary, it again, in our view, used a patently insufficient definition for unitary.</text>
