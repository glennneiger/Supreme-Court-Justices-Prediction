            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73976">The opinion of the Court in No. 90-285, Litton Financial Printing Division versus NLRB will be announced by Justice Kennedy.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="11.420" stopTime="225.907">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="11.420" offset="119638">This case, Litton Financial Printing versus National Labor Relations Board comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.802" offset="157150">Litton operated a printing plant and decided to eliminate part of its printing operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.691" offset="176689">Without notice to the Union, it laid-off 10 workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.823" offset="189228">This was at the time when an old collective bargaining agreement had expired and a new one had yet to be negotiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.953" offset="217754">It was a hiatus between the two agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.103" offset="230293">The Union filed grievances arguing that the lay-offs, which included some of the plant's most senior employees, violated the expired bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.652" offset="272507">That agreement had provided that seniority be the deciding factor in case of lay-offs and provided "if other factors such as aptitude and ability are equal".</text>
            <text syncTime="59.638" offset="312526">Litton refused to submit to grievance or arbitration procedures or to negotiate over the lay-offs.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.361" offset="331334">The NLRB eventually concluded that Litton had committed unfair labor practices in its refusal to bargain over the lay-offs, its refusal of the process the grievances, and its wholesale repudiation of any obligation to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.348" offset="375325">The Board ordered backpay and required Litton to submit the grievance procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.450" offset="387759">The Board held, however, that despite a broad arbitration provision in the collective bargaining agreement, Litton had no obligation to arbitrate any unresolved grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.843" offset="429346">This was so because the duty to arbitrate is wholly contractual.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.421" offset="443556">Litton's contract with the Union was no longer in effect and the lay-off grievances could not said to arise under the expired agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.958" offset="473754">The Court of Appeals reversed the Board on this point and it is that aspect of the litigation which we review today.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.685" offset="500712">When a bargaining agreement expires and the parties are in the process of negotiating a new agreement, the employer has a duty to refrain from making unilateral changes in the terms and conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.375" offset="543449">The Union argues that because arbitration and other dispute resolution provisions are terms and conditions of employment, the Board should impose a statutory duty to continue a practice of arbitrating disputes even where no contractual duty survives.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.255" offset="598933">We have previously recognized that labor arbitration is a matter of consent that would not be imposed beyond the scope of that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.313" offset="627145">The Board's refusal to impose a statutory duty to arbitrate is rational and consistent with the National Labor Relations Act and we will defer to the Board's rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.743" offset="660895">We decline to extend the unilateral change doctrine so as to impose any statutory duty to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.561" offset="688167">As we have recognized Nolde Brothers, a contractual duty to arbitrate a dispute may survive expiration of a bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.445" offset="715752">Where the bargaining agreement contains a broad arbitration clause, as in the case here, the duty to arbitrate cannot terminate in its entirety upon the date of the contract's expiration rather the duty to arbitrate continues as to any dispute arising under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.401" offset="771550">The employer's contractual duties must not be confused with duties arising from the statutory obligation to refrain from imposition of unilateral changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.472" offset="807808">Nolde Brothers should not be interpreted to require arbitration over whether an employer has made a unilateral change in what was a one-time contractual term or condition of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.492" offset="851903">We must determine whether the lay-off grievances in this case arise under the bargaining agreement even though the lay-offs did not occur until almost a year after the agreement had expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.933" offset="889623">We hold that they do not and that the Board was correct in declining to order arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.743" offset="912925">We reverse the Court of Appeals to the extent that it refused to enforce the Board's order in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.269" offset="934972">Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Blackmun and Scalia join; Justice Stevens has also filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Blackmun and Scalia join.</text>
