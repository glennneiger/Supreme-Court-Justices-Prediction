            <text syncTime="9.700" offset="177668">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.620" offset="189371">Congress has given the regulators of the Nation's financial institutions an extremely broad range of discretionary authority to achieve the specific policy ends of safeguarding the accounts of depositors and protecting the taxpayer-funded system of depository insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.770" offset="253945">This is precisely the sort of discretion that Congress chose to protect against attack when, as a safeguard to the limited waiver of sovereign immunity embodied in the Federal Tort Claims Act, it added the discretionary function exception of 28 U.S.C. Section 2680.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.466" offset="316744">There are two questions here.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.169" offset="323535">First, whether the Fifth Circuit erred in applying an operational distinction to exclude coverage of the exception to the discretionary acts of supervisory regulators under the aegis of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, who, consistent with their regulatory charge, provided managerial guidance to the leadership of the independent American Savings Association, a federally insured, State-chartered thrift in which Respondent was an investor.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.221" offset="423741">Assuming the Fifth Circuit did so err, the second question for this Court is whether the policy relationship of the challenged regulatory act is so clear as to allow this Court to hold as a matter of law that the discretionary function exception applies to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="86.278" offset="483927">Well, Mr. Gerson, you say there are two questions presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.511" offset="496884">In your Petition for Certiorari you only have one question.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.040" offset="510990">Are the two questions you stated both comprised within that question?</text>

            <text syncTime="97.196" offset="527604">Yes, they are, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.976" offset="530739">Although the Fifth Circuit held that the discretionary function exception covered the board's decision to merge IASA with another company, obtain a so-called neutralization agreement from the respondent, and replace the IASA board of directors, it held that the board's agents lost the protection of section 2680 when they began to advise management and participate in management decisions; when they hired a consultant regarding finance and asset management to advise them and the board members; when they directed IASA to convert to a Federal charter, so that it would become the only governmental entity with power to control IASA; when they supervised the filing of litigation on behalf of IASA and consulted with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in Washington about it; and when they advised and recommended which of the institution subsidiaries should be placed in bankruptcy and how, if at all, that should be done; and lastly when they intervened with State authorities who had attempted to install their own supervisory agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.219" offset="763751">Seizing upon a footnote in this Court's opinion in Berkovitz against United States adverting to the earlier Indian Towing decision, which was not a discretionary function case, the Fifth Circuit held that the board's officials</text>
            <text syncTime="168.808" offset="814115">"were only protected by the discretionary function exception until their actions became operational. "</text>
            <text syncTime="174.556" offset="837103">Inasmuch as the court recognized that the board officials were acting within their authority, saying that that was unchallenged, and also recognized that since there were no regulations guiding them at every turn, their acts were discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.971" offset="886735">And hence the operational criterion imposed by the court, we suggest, represented an erroneous understanding of both this Court's decisions in Berkovitz and Indian Towing.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.983" offset="926755">The discretionary function exception, which is categorical and makes no distinction as to operational activities, has meaning and antecedents which go back at least as far in this Court as Marbury against Madison in 1803.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.180" offset="987568">The Congress had that in mind when it crafted the discretionary function exception as a safeguard, it not appearing in earlier versions considered in several Congresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.581" offset="1033126">But of course this Court recognized that every act has some element of choice in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.814" offset="1054128">And hence, culminating with Berkovitz, this Court has adopted a two-part test for evaluating whether or not the discretionary function exception should be given application.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.981" offset="1098745">The first of those aspects of that two-part test is the question was there a discretionary act?</text>
            <text syncTime="245.963" offset="1122673">Absent that, the Court has not recognized any uniquely governmental function--</text>

            <text syncTime="1379.926" offset="5658575">As to the facts, the Court is being asked to make what amounts to initial findings of fact from extra-record materials not relied on or even mentioned by the district court, and not submitted to nor even used by the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.358" offset="5716254">For example, that Independent American was an unhealthy thrift in 1985 and 1986 when those regulators acted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1974.328" offset="8036136">In Indian Towing they asked for what was then called uniquely governmental function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.341" offset="8056198">In Berkovitz they asked for an exemption in the same words they use on page 2 of their brief before this Court, for acts "arising out of regulatory programs".</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.322" offset="8096113">And just 6 minutes or 10 minutes ago, the Government asked for acts which</text>

            <text syncTime="1997.710" offset="8129655">In each of these cases the Court has rejected the Government's attempt for such broad exemption in words almost remarkably similar to that Mr. Gerson stated just a few minutes ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.034" offset="8162987">In the district court the Government got its broad rule, that is, it got protection for any act which is an extension of a discretionary function.</text>

            <text syncTime="2902.707" offset="11749704">Indeed the only policy pointed to in the Government's brief runs directly contrary, pointing to informal suasion as being appropriate only in cases of small problems, not cases, as they allege Independent American to be, in desperate need of regulatory oversight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.780" offset="11801949">There is no policy threatened here except if the United States is able to persuade the Court that immunity is co-terminus with any regulatory choice that they make, so that any choice they make, as second-guessed by any court, goes to their regulatory authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="2978.551" offset="12053038">When the facts or law are weak, the United States again raises the specter of the flood gates of litigation or stopping the governments in its tracks.</text>

            <text syncTime="3003.652" offset="12153452">The United States wants this Court to consider the context, but we would submit that the immunity they seek takes one important player, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, out of the context of the checks and balances that now exists.</text>

            <text syncTime="3025.955" offset="12242686">Mr. Gaubert is stuck in the middle of a struggle between Congress, the Court, and the Executive, where the Executive keeps seeking a broader immunity, says it doesn't want absolute immunity, but only posits an automobile accident again and again as the only kind of act which arises under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.183" offset="12299633">They seek a rule not so much that the king can do no wrong, but that the king can do wrong only when he is driving his royal carriage.</text>

            <text syncTime="3058.753" offset="12373821">If the Government finds in the record that is developed below that they have grounds to show discretionary function, they can move again for summary judgment, the correct vehicle for testing these very fact-laden decisions.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart M. Gerson</label>
            <text syncTime="3091.740" offset="12505792">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.099" offset="12511225">Let us see what it is that the Fifth Circuit actually did hold with respect to the operational distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.408" offset="12540482">At 885 Fed. 2d, at 1287, the court specifically held, relying upon... that Indian Towing, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.640" offset="12573397">"did however establish a principal distinction between policy decisions and operational actions. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.013" offset="12590951">This distinction still retains its force today and is dispositive of this case... of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.183" offset="12611535">At page 1289 the court of appeals held, quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.259" offset="12627836">"Thus the FHLBB and FHLB-Dallas officials were only protected by the discretionary function exception until their actions became operational in nature, and thus crossed the line established in Indian Towing. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.973" offset="12678722">The Fifth Circuit's reference to Berkovitz cannot represent any shorthand for the appropriate test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.361" offset="12704322">Any such suggestion must be undone by the court's reference to Indian Towing as the source of the operational distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.936" offset="12730549">In terms of Indian Towing, which, as the Chief Justice pointed out, was not a discretionary function case, operational means no discretion at all, as well as no Federal policy countervailing the statute... the State, in that case good samaritan law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.009" offset="12786869">This complaint was amended after some period of time, and the particular acts set forth are the ones that the court of appeals relied on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.895" offset="12822396">However, it is very clear, I suggest, that there is indeed an antecedent policy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.471" offset="12840786">There is a statute, two statutes, which are cited, a regulation in furtherance of that, and in particular a resolution, all designed to further the antecedent... the twin antecedent policies of protecting depositor accounts and safeguarding the taxpayer supported Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.838" offset="12926154">Those policies long predate this case, as does the resolution statute and regulation which premise the regulatory activity here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.381" offset="12964398">As to the particular acts in question, I would note that at least some courts of appeals, including the Fifth Circuit in a case we cite in the brief, Williamson against Department of Agriculture, has recognized that decisions regarding the credit worthiness of individual loan applicants are discretionary functions in the context of a Federal loan program.</text>
