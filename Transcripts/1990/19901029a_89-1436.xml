            <text syncTime="42.910" offset="298923">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="45.529" offset="309372">The issue in this case is whether a grand jury must make a showing of relevance before obtaining enforcement of a subpoena for ordinary corporate business records.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.503" offset="357333">This case comes to the Court from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.240" offset="376246">A grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia served the subpoena on three companies, two of which are respondents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.144" offset="407906">The three companies were related companies, all were owned by the same man in New York, all had the same address, and all were in the same line of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.702" offset="446149">The subpoena, the two subpoenas that are at issue here called for business records of a variety of sorts from the two respondent companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.724" offset="490244">The district court had hearings, and with respect to each of the subpoenas, and ruled that there was no requirement of any preliminary showing of relevance.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.032" offset="543429">But in any event, even if there were, that the Government had adequately satisfied the court that the materials sought were relevant, based on the fact that the first company, a company named Model, which is not a respondent in this case, that the Model Company had distributed obscene materials in the Eastern District of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.695" offset="622110">And the other two companies, which were owned by the same person and occupied the same premises, although they were not shown to have distributed materials in the Eastern District of Virginia, nonetheless they were sufficiently related to the company that had, that the Government was entitled through the grand jury to inquire as to what activities those companies had been engaged in, and what the relationship was between those companies and Model, which had been involved in the Eastern District distributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.630" offset="745826">The court of appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.082" offset="755648">The court held that it was necessary under Rule 17(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for the Government to demonstrate both relevance of the materials and their admissibility at any potential trial before the subpoena could be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.163" offset="836001">Now we submit that this decision is clearly inconsistent with prior decisions of this Court, and in order to demonstrate, I think, just how inconsistent what the Fourth Circuit has done is, I would like to... to read very briefly a passage from the court of appeals opinion and contrast it with passages from opinions of this Court, because I think the contrast is quite sharp.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.182" offset="951984">The court of appeals said, and I will try to keep it brief,</text>

            <text syncTime="635.237" offset="2668229">But in any event, setting aside the question of whether there were materials that were distributed in Virginia by these two companies, the grand jury is entitled to know the relationship of those companies with Model and any other corporate forms of doing business of the principal in this case, who is Mr. Rothstein, who is really the person who is under investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.667" offset="2754015">He obviously does business in a corporate form through a variety of corporate devices, and it's... the grand jury's investigation would not be complete unless it had a good idea of the relationship among those corporations, even if it happened that one or two of them had not actually done business in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.730" offset="2826218">And that was what the prosecutor explained to the district court as the basis for the subpoenas that are at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.551" offset="2853490">Now, the question then is... the question arises, how could the court of appeals have made an error that seems as fundamental as this, and we submit they made just one mistake, but it was sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.132" offset="2935828">And that is the court viewed this Court's decision in the Nixon case, which construed Rule 17, the subpoena rule, as it applied to trial subpoenas, the court of appeals construed that decision to apply to grand jury subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.641" offset="3001865">Once you do that a lot of things happen, and the law goes really awry, because the Nixon case, and we believe correctly, applied Rule 17(c) in the context of trial subpoenas as a rule which requires a showing of relevance and admissibility, or at least the Court devised principles of trial subpoenas that required admissibility and relevance to be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.058" offset="3115550">And the reason for that is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.493" offset="3121297">The Federal system provides for limited pretrial discovery, it is governed by another rule, Rule 16, and it wouldn't make sense to have Rule 17, the subpoena rule, simply serve as a discovery device.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.218" offset="3172184">Well, that is fine in the trial context.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.586" offset="3181692">It won't work at all in the grand jury context, because the grand jury is a discovery device.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.424" offset="3204993">Talk about how Rule 17 should not be used for fishing expeditions is completely in apposite to grand juries, which are the ultimate fishing expeditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.346" offset="3244700">Grand juries, as this Court said in Morton Salt, investigate merely on suspicion that the law is being violated, or even just because the grand jury wants assurance that it is not.</text>

            <text syncTime="967.583" offset="3997653">Certainly the party can come forward and say, we certainly can't imagine how this could conceivably be relevant to any criminal activity, and could show that, for example, the activity sought occurred long before the statute of limitations period that is in question, or that there was absolutely no relationship between the district and the company that is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.967" offset="4099217">For example, suppose in this case there had been a company in Albany, New York which had no relationship to Mr. Rothstein, Model, or anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.721" offset="4130146">That company could come forward and say, what in the world do you want our materials for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.006" offset="4147282">Now, the district court might, in that setting, very well say all right, I will hear in camera, for example, from the Government, just to satisfy myself that there is some relationship, because frankly it looks fishy to me, and I can't see what in the world the Government might have that is of interest here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.666" offset="4209976">That is something that can be done quickly, can be done very easily, and if it is done in camera can be done without compromising the grand jury's secrecy concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.288" offset="4244458">However, we don't submit that this is something that ought to be litigated in an evidentiary hearing where it can be handled very quickly before the district court, either in an in camera proceeding or simply in an informal motion to quash, exactly as was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.250" offset="4308301">Now I think, if you will look at the proceedings in this case, frankly I think they were a model of the degree of inquiry that is appropriate for a district court to employ where the subpoenas are perhaps a little out of the ordinary, in this case subpoenas that were sent to a company that is outside of the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.610" offset="4377787">The grand jury in each case had, we think, good reasons which the prosecutor demonstrated, for seeking these materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.715" offset="4414149">And upon the prosecutor's demonstrating those reasons, the district courts... and there were three different judges who looked at this... each time were satisfied that yes, you have shown me enough to persuade me that there is, that these materials are relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.171" offset="4460020">Even though there is no obligation on the part of the Government to make a preliminary showing of relevance, I am certainly not going to quash these materials on grounds of relevance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.027" offset="4491367">That, it seems to us, is a perfectly suitable way for a district court to proceed, and it does not either reveal to an untoward extent what the grand jury is doing, nor does it impede the progress of the grand jury's investigation in a way that this Court in Dionisio and subsequent cases has indicated should not be allowed to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.273" offset="4576422">These things do take time, and they, at proceedings all the way through the court of appeals on nice questions of relevance end up depriving the grand jury of materials for long periods of time while the statute of limitations runs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2149.403" offset="8724876">And the second time around, when they wanted 193 tapes without any allegation the tapes were obscene, we were sustained on that as well, and they haven't sought review in this Court, for that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.675" offset="8761970">So that there is, it seems to me, a matter of record of, call it what you will, overreaching, overzealousness, or bad faith, whatever you want.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.380" offset="8796869">But this is the way this case ended up in the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.149" offset="8807945">And I believe that did have some influence on the court, when they said, now, what do you want the records from a bookstore in Brooklyn for down before your grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.922" offset="8842949">And when they took the position we don't have to say, we don't have to give any reason, I believe the court correctly concluded that that was inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.778" offset="8878371">I believe, Your Honors, that in all fairness the price to pay for preserving the right of privacy under the Fourth Amendment and the First Amendment, because I believe as deeply as I stand here that this is a pure First Amendment case and the consequences of this case, if anybody can come in and not make any showing at all, and the impact this would have of us giving up our customers, our suppliers, and the inhibitions and the chilling effect that that would have would set an awful dangerous precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.845" offset="8990698">What it would be a much better rule is to simply hold that in these cases a prosecutor must make some showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.349" offset="9016716">If he makes a showing and he satisfies the judge, and let me say very candidly to the Court it's a very flexible standard, and I suspect that a great many district judges will be satisfied with their representation, then that will be the end of it, and they will have satisfied their burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.525" offset="9069379">No one is suggesting for a moment that we don't have to turn over all of these records, that we won't have to deliver them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.627" offset="9089859">All we are saying is that there ought to be at the very least some indication as to how they are relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.615" offset="9109712">And once they meet that, and they have done it in all the other cases, the cases that have come up here before you and in the circuit courts where contempt convictions have been affirmed, they have met that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.986" offset="9147224">Wouldn't that be a much better rule than to say, and to abolish a rule, to say that prosecutors never have to make, even in a First Amendment case, any showing of relevance whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.076" offset="9183586">And for all those reasons, Your Honor, I would most respectfully--</text>

            <text syncTime="2285.192" offset="9268118">It is sort of speculative, but they did, as I understand it, at least in their briefs they say they made some kind of a showing to the district court, and he allowed the discovery.</text>

            <text syncTime="2319.846" offset="9406672">And as a consequence the Fourth Circuit then held that they thought there had to be more facts supplied to the district judge than just that one man owned the three companies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2344.730" offset="9506251">None of the district court judges relied upon that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2562.265" offset="10376337">Just very briefly, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.799" offset="10382502">The respondents quoted from a section of the transcript, and this is at page 645 of the Joint Appendix, and noted that the court had asked the prosecutor what you would expect to find in MFR's business records, as to which the prosecutor responded,</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.980" offset="10471214">"I am not sure, Your Honor, I don't know. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.514" offset="10477379">That is where respondents stop, both here and in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.868" offset="10490753">But the prosecutor went on, and he said</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.518" offset="10497336">"I assume we'll find that Mr. Rothstein's statement is accurate, that he is the owner of all three, that he controls all three, that the assets of all three are intermingled. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.057" offset="10535475">And the court then asks,</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.592" offset="10541640">"Would this be pertinent to the investigation? "</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.544" offset="10549477">And the prosecutor says "Absolutely".</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.428" offset="10557000">And the court asks "How"?</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.163" offset="10564001">And the prosecutor gives this explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.780" offset="10570375">If the grand jury were looking at the possible application, for example, of the Rico statute, and Model were found to have shipped obscene material into the Eastern District of Virginia, a jury could find, if we had the records to support this, that the assets of Model which were generated by the sale of obscene material were used to fund or support the business, the ongoing business of MFR books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.743" offset="10646234">This is one of several theories that the prosecutor laid out for the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.528" offset="10661385">This isn't just an I don't know, we're just on a wild goose chase type of answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.932" offset="10679044">He had an explanation and he gave it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.765" offset="10686358">The prosecutor also was responding, responded to the point that was raised in the district court and has been raised here, that the companies really are not shown to have been engaged in the same business--</text>

            <text syncTime="2709.458" offset="10965137">I would add this wasn't the only theory of relevance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.094" offset="10979661">There were several theories of relevance, and we have discussed them in our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2724.467" offset="11025219">And I think that would be entirely reasonable if there is a good faith basis for believing there may have been a racketeering violation here.</text>
