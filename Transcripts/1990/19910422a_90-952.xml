            <text syncTime="11.510" offset="181902">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.432" offset="193604">This is a case about the enforcement of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.305" offset="217115">Section 5 is the preclearance section of the act and was designed to apply to specific jurisdictions, including the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.400" offset="249506">It routinely and through a variety of nefarious means denied many of their own citizens the right to vote solely on account of skin color.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.895" offset="283466">In order to prevent this discrimination in the future, Congress exercised its authority under the Fifteenth Amendment and provided in section 5 that a covered jurisdiction may not implement a voting change unless and until it demonstrates to a Federal authority, the Attorney General or the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, that the change is not discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.551" offset="378029">By doing so, Congress shifted what this Court often has called the advantages of time and inertia from the perpetrators of the evil to its victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.056" offset="420138">This is a case about voting changes for elections for State court judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.662" offset="442499">Section 5 covers voting changes for elections for State court judges, just as it covers voting changes for elections of other public officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.749" offset="474891">This Court twice has summarily affirmed lower court decisions to that effect, the most recent being this past fall in the case from Georgia, and the appellees make no contention that judicial elections are excluded from section 5's coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.702" offset="534659">This appeal raises three issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.712" offset="542705">First, can voting changes involving the creation of judgeships that have not been submitted for evaluation under section 5 nevertheless be retroactively cleared solely because of the submission and preclearance of later voting changes involving subsequent judgeships in the same election district?</text>
            <text syncTime="125.708" offset="638731">Second, did the three-judge district court err in permitting elections for State court judges pursuant to uncleared voting changes to which the Attorney General objected under section 5 because of his concern about the possibility of racial discrimination?</text>
            <text syncTime="143.142" offset="708426">Third, in the event the district court did err in permitting the elections to go forward, what relief should be ordered by this Court at the present juncture?</text>
            <text syncTime="152.328" offset="745206">These issues arrive, arise in the following factual context.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.252" offset="768925">In Louisiana during the past 25 years the legislature enacted a number of voting changes with respect to judicial elections, most of them involving the creation of judgeships to be elected at large in majority white, multi-member districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.904" offset="831515">In violation of section 5 State officials implemented many of those voting changes and held elections for many of the judges without seeking preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.269" offset="864951">At the same time State officials did submit and obtained preclearance for some of the judgeships.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.643" offset="890447">As a result in some judicial districts there were combinations of cleared and uncleared judgeships within the same district.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.027" offset="923988">Only in response to this litigation in 1987 did State officials go back and submit all of the prior uncleared voting changes involving the creation of judgeships to the Attorney General for preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.639" offset="978427">Beginning on September 23, 1988, the Attorney General interposed objections to some of the voting changes involving the creation of judgeships in certain specific judicial election districts in the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.707" offset="1034747">State officials did not then take any action to seek preclearance in Federal District Court in the District of Columbia.</text>

            <text syncTime="238.144" offset="1088455">After the Attorney General's initial objection the State took no action to seek preclearance in Federal District Court in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.141" offset="1124399">Instead the State proceeded with the 1990 elections, even for the judgeships to which the Attorney General objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.957" offset="1151671">The plaintiffs filed a motion for an injunction to stop the elections and the district court denied the injunction for the most part.</text>

Board of Commissioners of Sheffield, Alabama, that section 5 submissions must identify exactly the changes that are being submitted to the Attorney General for review, and the Attorney General can never be deemed to have precleared those changes that are not submitted for review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1591.241" offset="6500817">The kinds of reasons they gave, that was the convenience of a particular date as the best time to have an election because it's likely to have most participation, well, for example, as to that factor these elections shouldn't have been held at all if the seats weren't precleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.990" offset="6551808">And the question of what date is the right date to hold it doesn't seem to us to be important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.403" offset="6565497">Another factor in this case the district court considered was the reliance interest of the candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.976" offset="6587753">But if you look at the history of these elections, they had been enjoined almost, they had been enjoined for a long, for quite a while under the section 2 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.942" offset="6623593">And it's very hard to see how there would have been little... there would have been much of any reliance interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.387" offset="6645431">Moreover, in the original order that the district court handed down concerning these elections, it said that the people would only be... that the winning judges would only take office provisionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.773" offset="6687018">And in fact it didn't even say they would be instated in office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.875" offset="6699348">It just permitted the elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.147" offset="6704468">And so in those circumstances, too, I think the reliance interest of the candidates would be weak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.269" offset="6724948">And finally, as the Court pointed out in Hampton County, where there has been a violation of the Voting Rights Act, in fact the uncertainty about the elections could well cut directly the other way, which is it could keep people from qualifying, from entering qualifications for running for office, and doing other things that... and it might therefore be most preferable to hold the elections... it would be preferable not to hold the election until the seats have been precleared and it is clear that a legal... a legally valid election is going to go forward.</text>

            <text syncTime="1888.199" offset="7688657">So what the three-judge court held on these situations is that when the Attorney General cleared a statute creating an ultimate number of judicial seats in a particular district, that preclearance constituted approval of all the seats necessary to reach the ultimate number of judicial positions in that district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.500" offset="7765875">The case is very different from the McCain v. Lybrand case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.533" offset="7777996">There what was unprecleared was the 1966 total change in the form of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.558" offset="7798058">In 1971 there were additional people added, and, too, and there were changes in the residency districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.062" offset="7828151">And that was precleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.884" offset="7831390">And the question presented in the jurisdictional statement, in the brief on the merits by the appellants, and in the brief by the United States is did this subselentio preclear that change from at large, and the Court said no, it didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.802" offset="7891054">But that situation is not presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.564" offset="7902130">We have added additional judgeships and those judges... approval of those additional judgeships constituted approval of the earlier ones.</text>

            <text syncTime="2830.468" offset="11457709">And cumulative voting, if you have eight seats, then they could cast all eight votes for one judge, or four votes for two judges, or whatever.</text>

            <text syncTime="2864.724" offset="11594799">And if Congress wanted to impose that on the judiciary in section 2, section 5, or some other section, then they would have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.698" offset="11622698">They would have discussed that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2876.112" offset="11640357">Obviously everybody is uncomfortable with subdistricting judges because it brings one-man one-vote in, which Thornburg v. Gingles is a one-man one-vote test.</text>

            <text syncTime="2912.092" offset="11784239">This Court said time and time again that it will allow a jurisdiction to go to Washington to seek approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.047" offset="11808063">It said in Perkins v. Matthews, it said it in Berry v. Doles, it said it in Hampton County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.170" offset="11832514">Most recently... really what this order is modeled on in this case, the 150 days, the order says that we go to Washington for approval, and if approval isn't obtained up in the Washington district court and appeals therefrom, that there's 150 days after that action is over with these judges are kicked out of office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.761" offset="11898969">That's the exact same order that was done in the Brooks case.</text>
