            <text syncTime="3134.577" offset="12668571">But again, that's not this case, where Mr. McCormick went to the doctors' lobbyist, who had previously picked up a $766 hotel tab for him, thus indicating his willingness to dispense favors, and said I've paid about $2,000 out of my own pocket and I haven't heard from your doctors.</text>
