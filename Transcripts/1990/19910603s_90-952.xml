            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="6.337" offset="99240">The first case is Clark versus Roemer No. 90-952.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.854" offset="117316">The case comes to us under our appellant jurisdiction as opposed to our certiorari jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.465" offset="139782">It involves issues under Section five of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.905" offset="153470">In order to prevent voting changes that have a discriminatory purpose or effect, Section 5 requires covered jurisdictions such as Louisiana to obtain pre-clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.086" offset="194221">This case involves the administrative pre-clearance mechanism in which before implementing new voting practices, the State of Louisiana was required to obtain approval from the attorney general of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.653" offset="244480">The procedural history of the case is somewhat complicated in this detail in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.905" offset="261512">In essence, the case involves voting changes in Louisiana which the attorney general refused to pre-clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.740" offset="288889">Despite the attorney general’s objections, the three-judge District Court, and that is the judgment that we review here, held that some of the electoral changes in issue were pre-cleared by implication when the attorney general pre-cleared related voting changes and some changes at a later date than the ones here in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.894" offset="365480">The court also refused to enjoin elections despite certain voting changes that it conceited with subject to valid objections by the attorney general.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.908" offset="409574">It reasoned that because the harm to all citizens of Louisiana from the injunction would outweigh the harm of allowing the elections to continue, the election should go forward and the winner should take office while the pre-clearance procedures were still ongoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.982" offset="469865">In an opinion filed today with the clerk, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.637" offset="480418">The District Court erred by not enjoining elections for judgeships to which the attorney general interposed valid objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.956" offset="509675">Unless voting changes are pre-cleared, they are invalid under federal law and unenforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.932" offset="529633">The District Court’s reasons for refusing to enjoin these elections lack merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.785" offset="549068">Both the court and the state had notice for over three years prior to the election that the seats were unprecleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.839" offset="577280">The court’s concerned about voter confusion and lower voter turn out and special elections was unjustified for voters may be more confused and inclined to avoid the polls when an election is held in violation of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.742" offset="628898">Moreover, the court’s concern to avoid invalid State Court judgments counseled in favor of enjoining the elections in order to avert a federal law basis to challenge the state judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.895" offset="681457">The District Court also erred we think in ruling that the attorney general precleared by implication certain electoral changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.223" offset="710818">Our decision in McCain versus Lybrand has made clear that submission of legislation for administrative pre-clearance under Section 5 defines the scope of the pre-clearance request.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.823" offset="757212">Under normal circumstances a submission pertains only, to identified changes in that legislation, and ambiguity in the submission must be construed against the submitting jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.381" offset="799426">Thus, the elections held for these seats violated Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.816" offset="817189">The appellants now request us to order that these elections be set aside and that the judges be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.077" offset="842162">This is not a proper matter for us to consider in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.039" offset="858044">In fashioning its decree granting relief on remand, the District Court should adapt a remedy that in all of the circumstances of the case, implements the mandate of Section 5 in the most equitable and practicable manner and with least offense to its provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.082" offset="922201">The opinion for the court is unanimous.</text>
