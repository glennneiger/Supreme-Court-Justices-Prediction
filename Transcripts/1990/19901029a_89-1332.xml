            <text syncTime="12.641" offset="180567">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.526" offset="196136">This case concerns the legalization or amnesty provisions of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.948" offset="229886">The question presented is whether the judicial review provisions of that act preclude district courts from entertaining broad pattern or practice claims directed at INS activities in processing particular legalization applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.660" offset="300730">The Eleventh Circuit upheld district court jurisdiction on such a theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.564" offset="320269">We submit that the court of appeals' holding is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.449" offset="335838">The statute is carefully structured to channel all review of determinations respecting legalization applications to a single time and place, namely a statutory review proceeding after the entry of a deportation or exclusion order.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.394" offset="403652">The Eleventh Circuit's departure from this framework, based on a nonstatutory pattern and practice exception, frustrates Congress' purposes in limiting review, imposes burdens on the courts, and intrudes into the INS' difficult and critical role in administering the legalization program.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.456" offset="479825">The statute's requirement of case-by-case review responds to the sheer magnitudes and demands of the legalization program.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.628" offset="512531">The statute represented a unique undertaking by Congress to offer millions of undocumented aliens the opportunity to adjust their status to that of permanent resident and ultimately to citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.185" offset="558820">Nearly 3.1 million applications were received by the INS which had to be processed in less than 2 years at the initial stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.625" offset="592570">Congress conceived this as a one-time program.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.827" offset="605318">And in recognition of the burdens that would be imposed on INS in attempting to administer it, Congress carefully structured and limited judicial review and administrative review to prevent various burdens from preventing the INS from accomplishing its function.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.872" offset="677520">The centerpiece of the statute is a careful structure that is designed to channel all judicial review into the one opportunity that an alien has to challenge either a deportation or an exclusion order that threatens to remove him from the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.298" offset="739274">This system serves many of the purposes that underlie any system that eliminates piecemeal review of legal issues apart from the final results on benefits applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.122" offset="786503">It requires that remedies be exhausted, thereby giving the agency the opportunity to formulate policy and to ensure that there are... whatever grounds are available to determine whether the alien qualifies or does not qualify are fleshed out at the administrative level.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.382" offset="847525">It creates a concrete record so that when a court ultimately reviews the legalization determination it will not set aside agency action for non-prejudicial errors or abstract legal questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="235.635" offset="1072596">And if a court of appeals determines that there is some constitutional error that requires setting aside a particular denial it can remand to the agency and the agency can readjudicate.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.958" offset="1205925">--Well, in theory the INS has prosecutorial discretion not to institute deportation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.295" offset="1239257">And so an alien who is denied his legalization application and wants judicial review and comes to the INS and says please put me in deportation proceedings so I can eventually get access to the courts, in theory could be frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.055" offset="1290248">There is absolutely no showing in this record that that has ever happened, and there is no indication that it ever will happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.776" offset="1317102">The INS is an agency whose mission it is to remove illegal aliens from the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.263" offset="1339149">And if an alien comes to the INS and requests this procedure, there's no indication that it won't happen.</text>

            <text syncTime="308.048" offset="1362242">Well, but the scheme also envisions, as I understand it, that information produced at these hearings should not be used by the INS to thereafter oust them, simply because the alien has come in and has requested this status.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.044" offset="1434235">Is that right?</text>

            <text syncTime="327.428" offset="1439773">Congress gave confidentiality treatment to aliens, but only at one stage of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.198" offset="1458790">Only at the stage of applying for legalization and having that legalization application determined through the process of administrative review.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.138" offset="1494630">Congress never extended that confidentiality protection to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.340" offset="1515424">Congress always contemplated that judicial review would take place only in the context of deportation proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="354.129" offset="1546562">Well, if we were faced with the situation in one of these cases where no review could as a practical matter be obtained without giving up the confidentiality or something of that sort, do we have a Webster v. Doe problem here?</text>

            <text syncTime="370.323" offset="1611345">--No, I don't think so, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.307" offset="1619287">I think that in the unique context of immigration, in which Congress has plenary power to distribute benefits and to effect the removal of illegal aliens, Congress has great latitude to craft a system that would serve important government interests in allowing judicial review but preventing burden to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.071" offset="1698281">Here Congress contemplated that aliens should have an opportunity to have one bite at the apple in court to determine whether their legalization application was improperly denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.129" offset="1746555">And it determined to consolidate that judicial review with the judicial review of a deportation order, which would mean that the courts look at that particular alien's case on one occasion, not on one channel to review the legalization denial and then a separate channel to review the deportation order.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.542" offset="1824191">Congress was well aware when it crafted this system that aliens who were illegally in the country have ample incentives and have demonstrated a proclivity for taking advantage of the legal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.231" offset="1866927">And so it wanted a system that would provide this fair opportunity for review, but not until the alien who was illegally in the country was actually confronted with an order directing him to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.956" offset="1913843">And I think that in the context of an immigration program such as this, where Congress is essentially legalizing millions of people who entered the country illegally, who have no status as citizens in the United States, and who are being given an opportunity essentially to leap ahead of the... the waiting list of people who would like to become citizens, and become permanent residents and then citizens, it should be allowed to craft a judicial system which is both fair and at the same time streamlined enough to avoid various burdens.</text>

            <text syncTime="476.241" offset="2035051">I take it, Mr. Dreeben, your entire case rests upon the prohibitory language in the statute that there shall be no administrative or judicial review except as provided in the subsection.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.067" offset="2086356">If it were not for the prohibitory language, this action would accord with standard administrative review principles and the action could proceed?</text>

            <text syncTime="498.423" offset="2123763">I think our case would not be as strong if Congress had not introduced this framework for judicial review with the preclusion provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.946" offset="2157827">But it is standard administrative law practice to review the validity of rules governing benefits programs when an individual is confronted with a determination on his particular claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.652" offset="2200668">So I think there would be a very strong argument that even if the preclusion provision had not been put in, the fact that Congress contemplated judicial review only at the point in which a deportation order was entered would require the courts to direct judicial review to that point, in which an alien can raise the very claims that were raised in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="550.308" offset="2331280">There people wanted to challenge a regulation governing eligibility for benefits in the Medicare program.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.629" offset="2356567">They attempted to bring a lawsuit before they had completed the administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.366" offset="2379554">Three of the people involved in that case had submitted claims and were afraid that their claims would be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.735" offset="2400975">One of the people in that case had not even submitted a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.888" offset="2413618">And this Court held that the provisions governing judicial review in the Medicare Act required that the claim about the validity of the rule be raised in the context of challenging a particular denial of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.796" offset="2465236">And that is a standard administrative law way of deciding the validity of rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="596.087" offset="2514346">I think Michigan Academy represents a distinctive situation, precisely because it did raise the question you alluded to about the possible preclusion of all judicial review of a constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.478" offset="2560008">There a different aspect of the Medicare Act was involved in which Congress had precluded judicial review of particular benefits denials.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.917" offset="2597729">And this Court in United States v. Erika had upheld that preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.369" offset="2615492">The next case down the line was Michigan Academy, which challenged a rule that was used to decide the validity of many benefits claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.093" offset="2654467">The Court was deeply troubled by the idea that there would be no judicial review of a constitutional claim or claim that the regulation departed from the statute, and it therefore read the language of that statute to leave open the possibility of judicial review of rules alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.353" offset="2719460">The language of that statute had some similarities to this statute, but it has many differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.757" offset="2741089">I think the most notable difference is that this statute is clearly structured to channel all judicial review up to one occasion, the opportunity for judicial review when a deportation order is entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.731" offset="2788945">This statute has no indication that it contemplates any other form of judicial review of determinations respecting legalization applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.003" offset="2822069">Second, the language that was construed in the Michigan Academy case is somewhat different from the language that is at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.840" offset="2853416">The language that is at issue here covers determinations respecting applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.144" offset="2874627">The language that was at issue in Michigan Academy spoke of determinations of the amount of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.215" offset="2898869">And I think in that context, given the very strong concerns that would be raised if all judicial review was precluded, the Court read that language to leave open a challenge to rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.421" offset="2935754">But there is no such necessity here, and indeed to recognize that kind of collateral action would disserve the important purposes that Congress had in limiting judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.545" offset="2976191">As I said, Congress wanted to make sure that remedies were exhausted through the administrative process so that the INS would have the opportunity to formulate its policy to act on particular cases and determine whether an alien would be disqualified from the benefits he sought on other grounds, wholly apart from his constitutional challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.875" offset="3057589">That makes some cases drop out of the process before they ever get to the courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1120.855" offset="4613442">So what we have is direct collateral review going straight out from the administrative process to district courts in contempt proceedings about the INS' performance of its obligations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1147.422" offset="4719708">The pattern of practice theory that was used in this case really is broad enough to allow any alien who doesn't like a legal ruling, or a ruling that he can characterize as a legal ruling, to go to court and say a pattern or a policy was applied to me and my application was denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1248.907" offset="5125651">Chief Justice Rehnquist, I think that the reasoning is the somewhat arbitrary sense that if a problem is affecting a large category of people the district court ought to hear about it, and if it is only a procedural error affecting one individual then we ought to leave it for the statutory review process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.570" offset="5208302">I don't think there is an intelligible line that can be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.688" offset="5220841">There are two Eleventh Circuit decisions... one Eleventh Circuit, one Fifth Circuit decision... that preceded this case that were relied on by the court of appeals in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.544" offset="5256263">The reasoning in those cases seems to be simply that there is a widespread problem going on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.615" offset="5280505">A Federal district court needs to get involved because it would be more efficient and wise to hear it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.186" offset="5302761">None of those cases analyzed the language of the statute or explained why claims that could be raised in the sole forum for review of those claims, namely the court of appeals, should also be entertained on the district court simply because they affect a lot of different people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.076" offset="5358349">I think it's just a judicial judgment that it would be more efficient to do it this way, but that was not Congress' judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.480" offset="5383949">Congress' judgment was to keep a case by case system in place in order to provide various benefits and in order to keep the district courts out of running the INS in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.455" offset="5427835">Now there is another set of respondents here besides the individual respondents, who I think all were clearly challenging some determination respecting their application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.096" offset="5470467">The other set of respondents are organizational plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.897" offset="5485618">One of them was a qualified designated entity which was designated under the statute to accept applications and to serve as something of an intermediary between the INS and the aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.372" offset="5531489">The second organization didn't have that status, it was simply a membership organization that gives legal advice to Haitian aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.294" offset="5567225">Those two organizations contend that they can come into court free from any exhaustion requirements and free from any restrictions of the statute because they could never have a deportation or exclusion order against them, and they therefore have to have a forum to address the harms that they claim have befallen them in this program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.256" offset="5639114">We think that that argument would completely undermine the careful scheme for judicial review that Congress prescribed for individual aliens.</text>

            <text syncTime="1387.980" offset="5681954">The court of appeals upheld standing for the organizational plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.348" offset="5699404">The court of appeals essentially reasoned that they had suffered an injury within the meaning of this Court's decision in Havens Realty, therefore they had article III standing, and the court never stopped to analyze whether allowing the organizations to bring suit would have any effect of disrupting the rest of the statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.493" offset="5772025">We think for several reasons that the organizations cannot be permitted to circumvent the scheme for review that Congress provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.249" offset="5803058">First, the language that precludes judicial review of determinations respecting an application applies to any claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.069" offset="5834300">It doesn't apply only to claims that were made by individual aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.807" offset="5849242">These claims that are made here by the organizations are identical in legal substance to the claims that are made by the individuals, and they are subject to the same bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.663" offset="5888740">Second, it would be most anomalous to read the statute to allow the people who are more remotely injured, these organizations, to have a superior vehicle to present their claims, that did not require exhaustion, and that did not allow the agency to complete its formulation of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.124" offset="5958539">All of the legal claims that are asserted by the organizations hinge on due process rights of individual aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.813" offset="5989259">They really are asserting a third-party standing theory in order to bring these kinds of claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="2125.016" offset="8630134">It was denied on a form letter denial saying that the person didn't meet the eligibility requirements because they were not credible.</text>

            <text syncTime="2143.211" offset="8702859">In fact, as a result of the district court action, we learned that the reason for this application's denial was because the Government maintained a secret list.</text>

            <text syncTime="2533.448" offset="10263832">A fair reading of 1160(e) is that these provisions for review limit review once there is a merits determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.654" offset="10300612">There is no point served in the purpose of this legislation or its legislative history requiring people to go through hearings, useless hearings, only to go back again on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2998.147" offset="12122601">That's right, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.064" offset="12130333">I think that that is what it refers to, and it means the denial on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.182" offset="12142767">The one final argument that I would like to call to the Court's attention, that this Court has recognized, as Justice O'Connor has pointed out, in the Bowen case and has made a distinction in a statute that is far broader than this statute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.013" offset="12218105">Under the Medicare Act it says there is no judicial review of any claims arising under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.417" offset="12243705">Far broader than the language here respecting a determination, and yet this Court properly crafted an exception saying that when it goes to the methods, when it goes in effect to the underlying machinery for determining the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.609" offset="12304518">In this case the Government sabotaged in effect that machinery, not allowing an individual in the normal administrative course, to have their claim heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.949" offset="12341820">And we would submit that this case in many respects is like Bowen for that reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="3073.362" offset="12423531">That speculation should be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.980" offset="12433980">The respondents have an opportunity to take advantage of the procedures that are provided under the Hobbs Act and under other procedures, and those claims can be adjudicated within the forum that Congress provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.622" offset="12476508">I'd like to answer Justice Scalia's concern about whether there is a due process interest in SAW status separate from the deportation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.144" offset="12514647">I think that in this case the due process interest is best conceptualized as having the SAW program provide a defense to deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.584" offset="12556338">Congress intended that SAW applicants could apply for SAW status and legalize themselves, but the full machinery of the process was not brought into play--</text>
