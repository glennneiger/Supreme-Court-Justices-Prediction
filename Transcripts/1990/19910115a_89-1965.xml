            <text syncTime="24.836" offset="232971">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="38.605" offset="288037">The Cottage Savings Association case involves a 1980 transaction between Cottage Savings Association and other savings and loan institutions regulated by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.293" offset="334849">This case is representative of numerous other transactions that were done during the same time period throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.611" offset="368077">This transaction occurred during a very difficult time period for the savings and loan industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.944" offset="393468">There was a point in time when savings and loans were caught in a cash squeeze.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.857" offset="413112">Interest rates were spiralling upward, and the institutions were watching their funds that they currently held or that normally would flow into the savings institution be depleted and put into higher money market yielding type funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.657" offset="480299">In order to maintain the funds that it had or attract new funds, the savings and loan institutions had to attract these funds by giving higher interest rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.798" offset="540798">The Federal Home Loan Bank Board was not a source of funds because they also were charging high interest rates to the member institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.584" offset="583953">On the other side of the coin, Cottage and other savings and loan institutions were straddled with low-rate, long-term fixed mortgages.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.221" offset="630555">As a result, their earnings were declining, since interest paid on deposits that they were able to maintain or attract far exceeded the income flow from the fixed-term mortgages that they held.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.693" offset="700459">In effect the savings institutions were lending long and borrowing short.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.639" offset="732224">The future did not look good for Cottage or other savings and loan institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.904" offset="757301">Then something happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.595" offset="768064">An agency of the Government, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, stepped up to the plate for its industry and adopted R-49.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.730" offset="808606">The stated objective of R-49, which was a promulgation of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, was to create a transaction that would cause a loss for tax purposes, and not require the savings institution to book the loss from a regulatory standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.475" offset="887600">The effect to the savings institution on their net worth requirement was negative if they entered into one of these transactions, and the sponsoring organization was recognizing that the policy of these transactions was to create a loss for tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.330" offset="978924">Cottage and other savings institutions were in a terrible financial situation, and they really had two choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.867" offset="1025108">One, they could sit back and watch their net worth further erode, and possibly taking it below the net worth requirements that were in existence, or two, follow the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's transaction, the transaction that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board promulgated and endorsed, and enter into a transaction that would create a loss for tax purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3405.912" offset="13757295">And it's clear under the statement of position of the AICPA, which the regulatory bodies would now follow because the regulatory bodies for RAP or regulatory purposes follow general accounting principles, would require these types of transactions to be realized and recognized from a financial accounting standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.068" offset="13853948">And, you know, that is, you know, consistent to the tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.491" offset="13875577">Realization should only require two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.954" offset="13897520">One, has there been an increase or decrease in value of the asset involved from the basis which you hold it, and two, whether or not there has been a sale or disposition.</text>
