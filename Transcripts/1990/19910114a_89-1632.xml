            <text syncTime="61.582" offset="376421">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="64.952" offset="389901">In this case the California court of appeal reversed a finding of juvenile wardship against Respondent, holding first that he had been seized under the Fourth Amendment, second that the detention was without reasonable cause to detain, and third, the rock of cocaine which he discarded at the time of the seizure was the fruit of that detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.117" offset="470567">Today we challenge the first and third conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.229" offset="486972">We argue that Respondent had not been seized when he dropped his contraband, and that in any event the discovery of the evidence was not the product of any illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.186" offset="526782">The relevant facts are that about 10:00 p.m. on April 18, 1988, two officers were on routine patrol in an unmarked car in Oakland when they turned a corner to see, about 40 yards away from them, four young men talking to the driver of a car parked on the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.078" offset="598358">When they looked toward the police car, the driver sped away and the pedestrians ran away.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.102" offset="622495">The officers drove to the approximate place where the men had been standing, and one of them, Officer Pertoso, got out of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.177" offset="654782">The other officer, McColgin, drove in the general direction toward which two of the pedestrians had run away.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.082" offset="682368">But Officer Pertoso ran the other way in an effort to intercept one or more of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.186" offset="706818">And that is just what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.966" offset="713923">As Officer Pertoso turned the corner he saw Respondent running toward him, but looking over his shoulder as if to see if he were being followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.904" offset="753734">When he turned to face the officer, the two men were 11 feet away from each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.856" offset="773483">At this point the officer had said nothing to respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.419" offset="787798">Respondent then did two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.091" offset="798456">First he threw an object onto the sidewalk, and then he continued toward the officer, who forced him to the ground and handcuffed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.837" offset="833460">The officer then recovered the object, which proved to be a rock of cocaine.</text>

            <text syncTime="604.426" offset="2547824">Continuing on the matter of the elements of a seizure, this Court has acknowledged, has defined a seizure in its case law as composed of two distinct elements: some official action and restraint upon the movement of the citizen at whom the action is directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.050" offset="2638312">That has been the rule since Terry v. Ohio defined a seizure as physical force or show of authority which has restrained the liberty of a citizen.</text>

            <text syncTime="640.638" offset="2692647">With regard to the requirement of a display of authority, this Court has said, beginning in a plurality of cases, of Mendenhall and Royer, and concluding with Delgado and Chesternut, that an objective standard requires the question whether an official action was such that a reasonable person would have believed that he or she was not free to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.334" offset="2787419">Respondent suggests that that test replaced that set forth in Terry, but we believe this is conceptually incorrect.</text>

            <text syncTime="682.156" offset="2858681">If an officer says to a pedestrian, stop in the name of the law, and the person flees, never to be caught, he has not been seized in any physical or constitutional sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1269.399" offset="5207716">One way of understanding the difference between our position and respondent's position is to consider if the facts of this case were exactly the same, with one change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.335" offset="5243452">And that is that respondent had succeeded in alluding the police after throwing down his rock of cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.710" offset="5264977">In respondent's view, a seizure would nevertheless have taken place, and the cocaine must nevertheless be suppressed, even though the police might not succeed in apprehending respondent for a period--</text>

            <text syncTime="1708.467" offset="6963981">Yes, we can, and we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.769" offset="6973176">That even if the court of appeal is correct and respondent is correct that control is not necessary to the seizure and that a person can at the same time be in flight and be seized, the independent act of throwing down the drugs not in response to any order or any indication from the police that that is what he's supposed to do is a sufficient intervening independent act of free will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.461" offset="7055932">On that point the Court's cases on the exclusionary rule are quite clear that there has to be an exploitation of the illegality, but for causation is not itself sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.998" offset="7094070">There has to be something purposeful by the exploitation of the illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.870" offset="7109535">And in that instance there would not be such an exploitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.873" offset="7125626">Now, as we have pointed out in our brief, the history of the Fourth Amendment strongly supports the conclusion that control is an element of a seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.170" offset="7162720">The common understanding of the term at the time the Fourth Amendment was adopted and as it is today, is that a seizure requires an element of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.795" offset="7197306">And that is revealed... the historical evidence, that is revealed in dictionaries of the 18th and 19th century, in early decisions construing the term seizure, and in early State constitutions that equated the concepts of arrest and of seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.188" offset="7270867">Now this Court has never found there to be a seizure when there has not been some element of governmental control in either of the senses that I have described.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.274" offset="7307230">Respondent suggests that we are advocating some major change in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.385" offset="7323635">In fact respondent's conclusion would lead to a fundamental change in the law, because it would be the first time that this Court had ever held that there was a seizure without any element of governmental control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.254" offset="7367102">The principle that a seizure requires an element of governmental control provides a clear and coherent interpretation of the term seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.808" offset="7405346">Respondent's view, in contrast, is virtually limitless, and it would lead to some absurd consequences.</text>

            <text syncTime="1835.650" offset="7472637">The question here is how far the police can go in engaging in intimidating and coercive conduct before the Fourth Amendment rights are implicated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1849.759" offset="7529166">You had four young men standing around a car at 10 o'clock at night.</text>

            <text syncTime="1861.897" offset="7577649">They take off and flee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.467" offset="7583919">Instantaneous with their flight, the police officers engage in a pincer maneuver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.570" offset="7604399">The purpose of the pincer maneuver was to cut them off, stop them, find out who they were and what they were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.597" offset="7636477">Office Pertoso says I didn't follow them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.250" offset="7651106">I ran in a different direction while the other officer went around the block.</text>

            <text syncTime="2827.010" offset="11438129">And indeed there was an acquisition of physical control there of the most dramatic kind, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.404" offset="11459654">There was a fatal collision into a roadblock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.807" offset="11469267">But what... what even distinguishes Brower more is that Brower was decided after Mendenhall, Terry, and Chesternut made no mention of any of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.885" offset="11521617">Moreover, Brower did not involve any question of the moment that the show of police force or use of authority constitutes a detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.002" offset="11570100">So I think Brower was kind of analyzed on its own facts, and we would urge this Court not to buy this Brower... bright line rule that they are relying on Brower for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.269" offset="11615135">It seems to me that the State is urging this Court to overrule Chesternut with Brower, without having... without Brower having made any mention of these other cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2883.958" offset="11665917">It wouldn't be overruling Chesternut.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.662" offset="11680755">Chesternut was decided the same way as it would be under this theory, but on a different ground.</text>

            <text syncTime="2897.375" offset="11719625">It would be just using a theory that Chesternut found it unnecessary to use.</text>

            <text syncTime="2908.933" offset="11765809">Maybe supplementing or refuting part of Chesternut with this rule in Brower.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.158" offset="11790678">Maybe not entirely overruling it, but supplementing it or--</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.131" offset="11806560">Continuing, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, the court of appeal here relied upon Chesternut in its analysis of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.210" offset="11854939">Under the totality of the circumstances here it was reasonable for the court of appeal to conclude that a person in Hodari's position was not free to leave, because the court of appeal found a detention in this 11-foot scenario where the officer was blocking his path, and they also said that was tantamount to a physical restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.393" offset="11923693">This opinion is consistent with the cases that we have mentioned in our brief, so there is no dispute that the right standard was applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.998" offset="11962041">We urge this Court to give deference to the decision of the court of appeal here, just as this Court did in the most recent case of Minnesota v. Olson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.054" offset="11998299">Minnesota v. Olson demonstrates that when a reviewing court has applied the proper standard, that this Court will decline invitations to micromanage the application of the standard to the facts, even if this Court does not endorse the outcome of the lower intermediate court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.867" offset="12073532">Here and in Hodari the court of appeal applied the correct standard to the facts, a fact-specific application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.360" offset="12103520">And they were reasonable in concluding that Hodari was detained in this 11-foot scenario.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.144" offset="12126612">Thus we would ask for the same consideration of Federal-State comity here that this Court gave in Minnesota v. Olson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.110" offset="12162557">And we would urge this Court to leave the case-by-case management or administration of these lower... intermediate court decisions to the lower courts rather than try to micromanage them in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.998" offset="12210100">This Court has broad powers, but it would be very difficult to micromanage all State intermediate... all State intermediate appellate court opinions or decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.995" offset="12246044">We agree with the Solicitor General that the discarding of contraband as a result of police action is a reoccurring one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.531" offset="12284183">The proliferation of State cases reflect that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.924" offset="12301737">But the State and the Solicitor General want to take all of these cases out of the Fourth Amendment with this bright line rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.400" offset="12335697">Inherent in this bright line rule is an element of harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.175" offset="12362759">It is our feeling that if this bright line rule were adopted by the Court it would give the police too much discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.808" offset="12389300">The State assumes that the police will not overreach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.680" offset="12400794">The State assumes that the police will not abuse their discretions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.733" offset="12416990">The State assumes that the police will not harass people by chasing them without a reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.956" offset="12445933">This bright line rule proposed by the State would essentially insulate the police from all wrongdoing, such as harassment, overreaching, and abuses of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.545" offset="12488252">And in essence the State's test would reward police misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.729" offset="12513016">For example, here the police did not have any reasonable suspicion of any wrongdoing, yet they engaged in this pincer movement that was designed to cut Hodari off, find out who he was and what he was up to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.567" offset="12564320">In the bright line rule, under the bright line rule any abandonment prior to the actual physical restraint would then not be suppressible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.373" offset="12603608">Since Terry v. Ohio this Court has recognized that while an officer needs flexibility on the street, there must be some limits on what the police officers can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.722" offset="12652928">This Court has also recognized that in police-citizen... that in police-citizen encounters... that police-citizen encounters need some constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.720" offset="12700993">So based... for these reasons we believe that this Court in Chesternut refused to adopt the bright line rule that would remove all these cases from scrutiny.</text>

            <text syncTime="3157.920" offset="12761806">He resides in Oakland, California, and he has a young child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.970" offset="12778002">So he is alive and well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.412" offset="12787719">When Hodari was confronted by the officer, he was effectively detained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.060" offset="12822306">Instantaneous with the detention, with the illegal detention, was the discard of this contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.093" offset="12842472">The issue here is whether or not this evidence was come at by the exploitation of the illegal detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.317" offset="12871311">And it is our position that it is because the abandonment of the contraband was a direct consequence of the illegal police action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.233" offset="12902972">The abandonment was not a product of Hodari's free will.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.173" offset="12918750">He had no time for reflection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.986" offset="12926064">There were no intervening circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.116" offset="12934528">And the abandonment was a direct result of a show of authority and the panic on the part of Hodari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.522" offset="12968173">Under Brown v. Illinois, Wong Sun v. United States, Taylor v. Alabama, and Dunaway v. New York, unless there are some intervening circumstances, some time delay indicating reflection, the abandonment will not be an act of free will.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.886" offset="13049675">In conclusion, we urge that this Court adhere to the Mendenhall-Chesternut standard as the proper test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.843" offset="13097427">The court of appeal applied the proper test here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.865" offset="13109548">We urge this Court to defer to the court of appeal's application of the proper standard to this fact-specific situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.961" offset="13137969">The objective characteristics of this pincer movement which resulted in the blocking of Hodari's path meets the standards this Court has set forth to define a seizure by a show of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.889" offset="13193662">We urge this Court not to repudiate the Mendenhall-Chesternut standard with a bright line rule.</text>
