            <text syncTime="1031.941" offset="4257184">But Congress's intent is clear enough, not only in the language of the statute, but in the revisor's notes when it states very briefly, this statute had gone back a long way... back to reconstruction and even before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.942" offset="4333253">There had been in times of national crisis very limited statutes enacted to protect officers against actions in hostile State courts starting with the New England States' resistance to the trade embargo against England, and again during the Civil Way, other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.098" offset="4421860">In 1948, Congress decided to broaden that protection to all officers, but it explained in the revisor's notes,</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.445" offset="4467209">"The revised subsection (a)(1) is extended to apply to all officers and employees of the United States or any agency thereof. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1102.587" offset="4539829">But there are important distinctions in the notes and the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.619" offset="4559996">The statutory language refers to a right of removal by any officer of the United States or any agent thereof or person acting under him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.145" offset="4594060">Here they explain exactly what the change is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.788" offset="4608584">We're now broadening this to apply to all officers and employees of the United States or any agency thereof... not all agencies... all officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.215" offset="4654350">This note is important, too, because respondents would take either of two routes to find a right of agency removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.791" offset="4692593">The first is by reading ambiguity into the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.414" offset="4711088">And the second is by construing this language "or person acting under him" to mean anyone... any agency, any entity, any anything... operating under any officer of the United States, tracing all the way up to the President of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.558" offset="4795725">And the reason why it is very important for this Court to attend to that argument is that respondents, NIH, Tulane, and IBR are... they all contend that Tulane also would be a person acting under an officer and entitled to a move to Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.101" offset="4885900">By that construction, if Tulane is an entity because it has the NIH's vague approval of what it's doing in this case, then anyone who has spent $1 of Federal money or has the approval of any Federal agency or officer for its actions would be entitled to a move to Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.857" offset="4980881">And in that case, the Mesa requirement that there be a Federal defense poses no obstacle at all because all of these respondents say that they do indeed have a Federal defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.326" offset="5034797">And that Federal defense is sovereign immunity because what they contend we are attempting to do here is interfere with the actions of the Federal Government which have been expressed in some terms about which we are not entitled to receive discovery but which they say... and this Court is instructed to accept as fact... have something to do with science which is not to be tampered with by us--</text>

            <text syncTime="1281.843" offset="5256838">The wire tappers in the Camacho case who were sued for a violation of Puerto Rico law were not officers or employees either.</text>

            <text syncTime="3479.889" offset="14049028">That's the fundamental injustice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.621" offset="14059999">And I also think that it's fundamentally unfair to read these statutes broadly to confer Federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.246" offset="14094481">As this Court is well aware Federal courts are, by origin and design, courts of limited jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.071" offset="14121753">And it is not only unfair but unconstitutional for the Federal courts to exercise jurisdiction and in an area where State law predominates, State issues are paramount, and the Federal interest has not even been tested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.920" offset="14185178">For article III standing to apply so that the Federal interest cannot even be plumbed in the district court to which they have removed is not an appropriate exercise of jurisdiction.</text>
