            <label>Mr. Timothy T. Coates</label>
            <text syncTime="23.538" offset="222382">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.178" offset="224890">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="26.303" offset="233354">This case arises from a class action lawsuit filed by prisoners in the Riverside County Jail against the County of Riverside and its Sheriff, Cois Byrd, seeking a determination that the County of Riverside fails to provide warrantless arrestees with a probable cause determination promptly after arrest, as required by the Fourth Amendment as interpreted by this Court in Gerstein v. Pugh.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.091" offset="324573">The case essentially raises two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.214" offset="333037">First a threshold question of standing under Article III of the named plaintiffs to maintain this suit for injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.400" offset="361772">The second issue is one of substantive criminal procedure of great importance to the States at large, namely whether a State can incorporate a probable cause determination into an existing pretrial procedure, that by its nature may accomplish additional purposes, provide additional protections, and as a result take additional time to perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.844" offset="443587">The case originally was filed as a complaint by Plaintiff Donald Lee McLaughlin on behalf of himself and others similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.169" offset="472844">A first amended complaint was also filed, again with Mr. McLaughlin alone as the named class representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.699" offset="494996">It alleged that he had been held 5 days in the Riverside County Jail, had been released, during that time had never seen a judge, had not received a prompt arraignment, probable cause, or bail hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.475" offset="538046">The county moved to dismiss the first amended complaint based on Mr. McLaughlin's lack of standing to maintain an action for injunctive relief, since he was no longer in custody and hence no longer suffering the constitutional violation which formed the basis of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.437" offset="593948">Plaintiffs then filed a second amended complaint, adding three additional plaintiffs for purposes of the probable cause dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.059" offset="624459">As to these three plaintiffs it was alleged that they had been arrested without warrants, were presently in custody, did not and have not received a prompt probable cause determination, bail, or arraignment hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.039" offset="676390">The county answered the second amended complaint, the class was certified, and then the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="436.138" offset="1872694">That's what I'm saying, the allegations of the complaint here are not clear on that fact, and that is what our argument there turns upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.152" offset="1892756">But turning to the merits of the argument, as mentioned, the preliminary injunction, the thrust of it was that the County of Riverside was not providing warrantless arrestees with a probable cause determination promptly after arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.739" offset="1943120">The period used by the plaintiffs to define this was 36 hours, which is a period applied in an Orange County case also brought by the plaintiffs' counsel, also decided by that district court judge, which was settled prior to resolution of the preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.968" offset="2000067">In moving for the preliminary injunction, the evidence presented by plaintiffs was that people in Riverside County, warrantless arrestees, would not receive a probable cause determination until the time of arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.714" offset="2047088">The chief evidence presented on this were booking sheets for the Riverside County Jail which showed the arrestees' process through the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.695" offset="2074986">The district court found that providing probable cause determinations within the time frame of arraignment in California, which is 2 days, excluding weekends and holidays, was too long under Gerstein, holding that per se once the time in which to complete the administrative steps instant... incident to arrest had passed, that was the time that you had to have the hearing, even if it was on an ex parte basis, even if it was on a weekend, within 36 consecutive hours of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.636" offset="2186686">The county contended in the district court and again in the Ninth Circuit that California has essentially taken up this Court's invitation in Gerstein to incorporate probable cause determinations into existing pretrial procedures that may afford an arrestee additional benefits than would be available in a straight ex parte hearing devoted solely to determining the issue of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.237" offset="2277174">Indeed, following this Court's decision in Gerstein, the supreme court, California Supreme Court, in In re Walters expressly held that misdemeanants were to receive this at the time of arraignment.</text>

            <text syncTime="577.518" offset="2438297">As I noted before the break, in Gerstein v. Pugh this Court expressly declined to set forth a specific period of time in which probable cause determinations were to be provided to warrantless arrests.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.450" offset="2485945">Instead the Court recognized that there was no uniform State criminal procedure, and in fact invited the States to incorporate these hearings into existing pretrial procedures such as arraignment or even preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.727" offset="2535055">In so doing the Court even noted that several model codes of criminal procedure already provide for this, and one of them, the ALI model code, allowed this probable cause determination to be done as much as 72 hours after arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.158" offset="2588867">The State of California took the Court up on its invitation in Gerstein, and essentially has incorporated these hearings into arraignment, which, under California law, specifically Penal Code Section 825, must be held no later than 2 days after arrest, but excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.</text>

            <text syncTime="1221.382" offset="5013762">They don't benefit the vast number of arrestees, and in fact they really operate to the detriment of the majority of arrestees, because you'll end up getting a slowing of the entire process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.691" offset="5050960">Obviously, fiscal concerns are not the be all and end all when it comes to constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.986" offset="5076142">We're not saying they are, but there is a reality that criminal justice systems are operating within very strict budgetary parameters at times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.843" offset="5107594">And pulling a judge to sit in an ex parte proceeding to hear a handful or more of people who want these hearings is just not efficient, when you look that it will end up delaying arraignment, could delay preliminary hearings, and with resources, could even delay trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.727" offset="5159107">It just doesn't benefit the arrestee class as a whole to have a less protective hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.147" offset="5184812">And again, I note that there is no finding by the district court, and certainly plaintiffs have not argued that the County of Riverside unnecessarily delays arraignment, that we're dragging our feet within the California period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.283" offset="5233295">There's simply an assumption that arraignment automatically is going to be too late, because it's going to take place sometime after these administrative steps incident to arrest take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.403" offset="5277808">The State has and a very significant interest in having some sort of uniform time period within certain parameters that can be applied on a case-by-case basis, and indeed it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.634" offset="5318768">California uses 2 days as an outside time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.992" offset="5328172">But the California Supreme Court held in People v. Powell that... just that you get them to arraignment within 2 days isn't necessarily reasonable if they can show that there has been some pernicious delay through the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.268" offset="5377282">And plaintiffs have at no point attempted to show that, and the district court doesn't indicate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.329" offset="5397553">It goes solely by the standard that once the time you complete those arrest reports ends, you must have that ex parte... essentially an ex parte proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1438.969" offset="5884057">I think the Court made it clear it was not precluding the States from providing additional protections that may afford the arrestee additional benefits, and also recognize that the States themselves had an interest in not having an entire separate tier of proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.664" offset="5946856">And again, that is essentially what we have mandated in California now.</text>

            <text syncTime="1460.052" offset="5968381">In fact, attorneys are basically going on a county-by-county, city-by-city basis to have a determination made within each jurisdiction as to what the reasonable probable cause time period is in that jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.408" offset="6017804">For example, in our case you can see there are a trio of lawsuits involving Orange County, Riverside County, and San Bernardino County, all before the same district court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.373" offset="6057719">All of those have a 36-hour requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.606" offset="6066601">On the other hand, the Ninth Circuit, in the case of Bernard v. City of Palo Alto, said it was 24 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.542" offset="6090320">Indeed even,... indeed even in the context of our own case the district court has left open the question as to what the time frame might be for the outlying jails in Riverside County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.508" offset="6126265">And the result is that we end up having a real patchwork in California of the time frame in which these hearings must be conducted, and they are determined solely by the intervention of the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.674" offset="6166911">We submit that that is an improper injection into the State's own administration of its criminal justice system.</text>

            <text syncTime="2607.889" offset="10559767">If I may respond to Justice Blackmun's inquiry as to the practice throughout the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.150" offset="10584740">I note that when Mr. Stormer responded he talked about Santa Clara County which was subject to the injunction in Bernard v. City of Palo Alto, 24 hours, and also to Orange County, which was another county that was subjected to a district court hearing like this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.209" offset="10636985">The general practice in California, and it is clearly evident in California Penal Code Section 991 and also in the California Supreme Court's decision in In re Walters, is that the Gerstein hearing is conducted at the time of arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.703" offset="10691006">People v. Powell, a California Supreme Court decision that predates In re Walters, says this is an issue that is raised at arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.795" offset="10723398">So I take great exception with Mr. Stormer's representation that this is unique to Riverside County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.260" offset="10741266">It is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.681" offset="10742937">It is completely codified in California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.696" offset="10754954">And I think it again bears noting that when you look at the district court's findings of fact, brief though they were in the order granting preliminary injunction, the time period it talks about is the arraignment time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.067" offset="10804482">When the Ninth Circuit issued its opinion in this case it talks about the 2 court day time period of arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.080" offset="10832485">I think there is an assumption here, and I think it's clear from the record, the county gives these hearings at arraignment if they are requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.764" offset="10859235">You are advised of your right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.014" offset="10864250">If there is a problem that the advisement isn't as clear for felons as it is for misdemeanants, or that the district court didn't believe we were doing it at arraignment but were waiting until preliminary hearing for felons, then the remedy would have been, and if the court believed you could do it at arraignment, would have been to require it... make us clearly do it for felons at the time of arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.553" offset="10934363">But the district court was willing to assume that we did it for felons at arraignment, but just said no, you can't do that, that is per se too long under Gerstein because you don't need that amount of time in which to basically do an ex parte hearing of probable cause issue alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.172" offset="11000923">And Mr. Stormer is correct that we acknowledged in the district court that a strict probable cause hearing alone might be done in the average case in 24 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.215" offset="11041047">It doesn't take that long to just prepare that paperwork.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.152" offset="11052750">But what has never been denied in this case, that if we are in fact to be permitted to include it in our preexisting pretrial proceeding, such as arraignment, that proceeding and the additional protections themselves inherently take more time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.536" offset="11102278">Those we cannot do within 24 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.988" offset="11116175">Those we largely cannot do within 36 hours, although I would suggest that a review of the booking sheets that we submitted in opposition to the motion for preliminary injunction, and I... we have a statistical breakdown in our brief, show that we are fairly quick in arraigning people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.998" offset="11172181">There are people that are arraigned within 1 court day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.607" offset="11182630">The majority, vast majority are easily within 2 court days of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.371" offset="11197677">We are not slow in arraigning people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.933" offset="11207917">The essential issue before this Court is whether Gerstein meant what it said in many respects in terms of allowing the States to incorporate these hearings into existing pretrial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.302" offset="11249399">Now, in Williams v. Ward the Second Circuit very carefully examined this Court's decision in Gerstein, and also in Schall, and said if the proceeding, such as arraignment, offers additional benefits and serves other State interests as well... some of the benefits are for the arrestees, some are for the States... then it's okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.436" offset="11321915">It is a reasonable delay, it is necessary to incorporate it into existing pretrial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.059" offset="11340410">But I suggest there is a clear conflict between that and the position taken by the Ninth Circuit, because the Ninth Circuit allows no delay beyond the time necessary to conduct those administrative steps incident to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.991" offset="11392133">Now the Ninth Circuit decision in this case does not mention Williams v. Ward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.958" offset="11408015">It doesn't even talk about the California Supreme Court's decision in In re Walters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.785" offset="11423375">It doesn't mention Schall v. Martin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.800" offset="11431421">It simply declares that once, administrative steps incident to arrest have been completed, you must have this hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.516" offset="11454199">And I suggest again, if you look at Bernard v. City of Palo Alto, where the Ninth Circuit upheld a 24-hour probable cause determination, you see the same counting done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.465" offset="11494010">That is to say, the lower... in the lower court the public entity argued that under California procedures they were doing it at arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.447" offset="11517938">The Ninth Circuit said, look, only at the time necessary to complete the administrative steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.509" offset="11534239">If States are to be permitted to incorporate these hearings--</text>
