            <text syncTime="30.070" offset="251379">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="34.325" offset="268411">This case involves the holding of the lower court that the Eighth Amendment does not allow relief directed at continuing conditions of prison confinement unless the individual defendants in the case acted with persistent malicious cruelty in maintaining the conditions of confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.217" offset="347927">To affirm the lower court's decision in this case would mean that the conditions of confinement in the Nation's prisons could fall beneath any standard of decency without redress from the Federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.336" offset="400381">The truly terrible conditions that gave rise to cases such as Hutto v. Finney would return.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.432" offset="428802">To affirm the lower court would mean that even if a prison deprived prisoners of the basic necessities of life on a continuing basis, that fact, regardless of the consequences in suffering and death to the prisoners, would not be enough to justify Federal court intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.698" offset="517828">For this Court to affirm the lower court would necessarily mean abandoning the holdings of Rhodes v. Chapman, of Estelle v. Gamble, of West v. Atkins, of Youngburgh v. Romeo, and also the rationale of DeShaney v. Winnebago County DSS, that government has an affirmative duty to supply the basic necessities of life to those whom it has deprived of the ability to supply those necessities on their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.157" offset="651679">Affirming the lower court would cause serious doctrinal problems because it would in effect create a good faith immunity defense to injunctive actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.836" offset="698386">Such a holding would be inconsistent with this Court's settled rule that good faith immunities apply solely to damages actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.232" offset="736002">And there is good reason for this rule by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.535" offset="749168">Giving prison officials a defense against damages when the constitutional deprivation is not their personal fault makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.382" offset="788561">Denying injunctive relief on that ground makes no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.503" offset="805070">Once continuing conditions of confinement in a prison are bad enough to violate the Constitution by denying the basic necessities of life, the point of injunctive relief is to end the suffering, not to fix the blame.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.825" offset="870376">No case in this Court supports the application of a malice standard to challenges to continuing conditions of confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.101" offset="907470">No case in the courts of appeals other than the lower court decision that is before the Court today supports such a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.426" offset="940802">The decision below is inconsistent with fundamental principles of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence established by this Court, and should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.703" offset="977896">In this case, the court of appeals held that the critical issue was the prison officials' state of mind, and that the affidavits of the petitioner, Mr. Wilson, did not put in issue the prison officials' state of mind under this Court's decision in Whitley v. Albers.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.804" offset="1050308">According to the court of appeals, because the prison officials had alleged that they had made affirmative efforts to improve conditions, they could not be acting with, quote, "obduracy and wantonness", and then there is an ellipsis from the court of appeals, "marked by persistent malicious cruelty".</text>
            <text syncTime="249.439" offset="1128780">Whether one construes the holding of the lower court as applying the full Whitley prison disturbance standard requiring malice and sadism, or some newly invented standard of the lower court requiring malice but not requiring sadism, the application of a malice standard to continuing conditions of confinement was error.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.482" offset="1225015">This case is governed by Rhodes v. Chapman, in which the Court dealt with a challenge to continuing conditions of confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.649" offset="1257615">In Rhodes this Court held that Eighth Amendment challenges to continuing conditions of confinement should be examined by determining whether the conditions, alone or in combination, deprived prisoners of the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.091" offset="1335460">These necessities, as set forth in Rhodes and later in DeShaney, include food, medical care, sanitation, shelter, and reasonable safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.208" offset="1383839">Had the court of appeals simply applied Rhodes, as its opinion makes clear, it would have remanded most of Wilson's claims for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.107" offset="1419470">Wilson's claim of a lack of heat provides a convenient example of how the court of appeals should have analyzed this case under Rhodes v. Chapman.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.471" offset="1456982">In their brief in this Court, the prison officials concede that a lack of heat can violate the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.877" offset="1486553">Wilson's allegations included a claim of a lack of heat since the prison opened in 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.651" offset="1517691">A lack of heat is an obvious condition.</text>

            <text syncTime="988.113" offset="4083542">Our position in this case can be stated very simply, and that is that a prisoner is subjected to cruel and unusual punishment if the conditions of his confinement deny him a minimal level of basic human needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.234" offset="4135996">Now, it follows from that that where the conditions of confinement are at issue there is no need to inquire into the state of mind and certainly no need to inquire to find that the conditions are the product of, and I quote, "persistent malicious cruelty", as the defendants in the court of appeals suggest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1075.125" offset="4431598">And that is suppose that the warden, the prison officials... the prison officials are trying to do a good job, but they don't have the resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.651" offset="4461691">There is some reason in just the way resources are allocated by the legislature or requirements of law that they can't provide the services that are basic to human necessity, human life.</text>

            <text syncTime="1132.027" offset="4659176">Now, it seems to me you have created a fiction if you do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.270" offset="4672133">It is not, in our view, the most direct way to approach the problem, but it's going to be a way that will result in most instances, perhaps all instances, in the same result.</text>

            <text syncTime="1148.249" offset="4724064">Well, it may be though.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.469" offset="4732946">When you speak of deliberate indifference, the normal sense is that somebody has some kind of moral culpability with respect to the conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.595" offset="4769413">It may be that the... nobody, no one person in the legislature ever sat down and looked at the situation and said this is a problem but we are not going to attend to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.122" offset="4807552">So if, when... normally when you say deliberate indifference you are talking about somebody who is reckless or something like recklessness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.685" offset="4829808">We don't think that should be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.738" offset="4838063">But, of course, if the Court construes the term deliberate indifference in a way that does not impose this kind of moral requirement of recklessness, but simply says if you have a condition which is a general condition in the prisons and it denies people the necessities of life, that's deliberate indifference, then you come out exactly where we come out.</text>

            <text syncTime="1231.688" offset="5057805">It was admittedly dictum, but I think the dictum is very telling, in which the Court said with respect explicitly to the Eighth Amendment, it said that there is a duty when you have someone in your custody... you have taken them into your custody and you have thereby deprived them of the ability to fend for themself, that if they are nonprisoners it's the due process clause, if they are prisoners it's the Eighth Amendment, you have a duty to provide them with the basic necessities of life.</text>

            <text syncTime="1277.851" offset="5242438">But in each of those cases, either the premise or the explicit point was that there is a duty under the Eighth Amendment, in a case in which you have somebody in your custody, to provide them with the basic necessities of life.</text>

            <text syncTime="1361.828" offset="5578373">If I, as a prison warden, decide to punish you, prisoner number 443, by arranging for your cell mate to attack you, that's a violation of the cruel and unusual punishment clause, and you can... that is actionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.320" offset="5636365">But that doesn't mean that's the only thing that's actionable, and it doesn't mean that although state of mind is necessary in that case, because it is an isolated instance, that state of mind is also necessary in cases involving general continuing conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.697" offset="5685893">I think the problem, to reiterate, which we see with the position that the court of appeals took and that the respondents are arguing for is that it leaves a major hole in the cruel and unusual punishment jurisprudence that this Court and the lower courts have recognized for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.301" offset="5780247">We are not asking for a radical change in the way cruel and unusual case... punishment cases are litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.376" offset="5804593">This is, if you will read these cases one after another in the lower courts, this is the standard they have used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.410" offset="5828731">They have said are the conditions unacceptable?</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.432" offset="5840747">If they are and it's a product of general prison conditions, that's a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.627" offset="5861540">And I think if this Court in fact adopts the position urged upon it by the State, that will be a radical change in the nature of cruel and unusual punishment litigation, and we would strongly urge that the Court not follow that path.</text>

            <text syncTime="1480.742" offset="6054011">In Whitley v. Albers this Court determined that it is wantonness and obduracy that characterize conduct prohibited by the cruel and unusual punishment clause, whether that conduct occurs in connection with conditions of confinement, supplying medical needs, or in quelling a prison uprising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.403" offset="6128721">A necessary balance between the competing societal interest of humane treatment of inmates and the security and financial concerns of operating our Nation's prisons requires a standard that affords proper deference to prison officials' decision making.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.985" offset="6194967">This balance would be achieved in a conditions of confinement case by defining wantonness and obduracy as requiring malice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2893.218" offset="11703983">--Your Honor, I believe what the lower court did was identify that Whitley v. Albers' wantonness and obduracy is what controls the analysis of conditions of confinement claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.066" offset="11743375">They then did add an additional sentence that said that wantonness and obduracy would be defined as behavior marked by persistent malicious cruelty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.681" offset="11777753">The court did not apply the Whitley v. Albers test, which has been argued by our opponent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.215" offset="11795934">In fact there was no... nowhere in the entirety of the opinion the word sadistic utilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.398" offset="11820698">Unquestionably an analysis that looked at a sadistic state of mind would have required additional evidence than simply showing malice.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="2930.816" offset="11854344">But wanton and obdurate does... which are the words the court of appeals did use, certainly suggest some sort of subjective inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2940.180" offset="11891751">Clearly there was an inquiry into state of mind, without question, and the lower court found, correctly, that there was no evidence that could have supported a reasonable jury determination that the prison officials acted with a wanton and obdurate state of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.280" offset="11952146">And the position of the respondents is that regardless of what standard is utilized for analyzing wantonness and obduracy, be that deliberate indifference or malice or persistent malicious cruelty, the outcome in this case is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.502" offset="12017034">There is no evidence in this record that would show that the prison officials in any way acted with a wanton and obdurate state of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.768" offset="12046082">In conclusion, Your Honors, the cruel and unusual punishment clause was never intended to serve as an escape from the unpleasantness of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.304" offset="12080251">Ohio does not seek to operate its prisons without regard to prisoners' constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.726" offset="12101984">However, inmates should not be encouraged to use the Federal courts as arbiters of grievances for what amount to only uncomfortable living conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.342" offset="12136466">The lower court imposed a meaningful test that protects the rights of inmates and still allows appropriate deference to prison officials' decision making.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.620" offset="12169589">Therefore, respondents respectfully request that this Court affirm the grant of summary judgment by the lower court.</text>

            <label>Ms. Elizabeth Alexander</label>
            <text syncTime="3023.508" offset="12225073">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.380" offset="12236567">I want to begin by going back to the last series of questions, Mr. Chief Justice, that you asked opposing counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.618" offset="12269482">I want to point out that the court of appeals found that most of the claims raised by Wilson did suggest the type of seriously indecent conditions that, if proven, would violate the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.783" offset="12314203">That is, the first thing that the court of appeals did was not the state of mind analysis, but whether the conditions alleged were bad enough that there was an Eighth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.020" offset="12351088">On that ground it has already said yes, most of these claims do rise to that level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.104" offset="12375434">I... as to the... I want to go back to the point about whether or not Rhodes has anything to say about whether or not the state of mind analysis applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.683" offset="12425798">I submit that the Court's discussion in Rhodes of the Hutto case makes very clear that in Rhodes this Court saw no reason for a state of mind test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.691" offset="12469789">The Court in Rhodes makes clear that in Hutto v. Finney the Constitution was violated because the conditions were so bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.936" offset="12502807">There is no suggestion in that language that there was some other element necessary for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.348" offset="12520466">And Rhodes and Hutto also say that the conditions of confinement are punishment, because they are... and that's why they are to be analyzed as they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.286" offset="12568218">Because they are punishment in a sense, I think that they are equivalent to Justice Scalia's point about don't we know that these are intentionally imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.633" offset="12605625">When the conditions are in the sense that one intends the natural consequences of one's act imposed on a condition, on a continuing basis, those are part of the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.349" offset="12652437">Given that they are part of the punishment, then Whitley simply isn't relevant, because Whitley is a case that analyzes when some particular conduct that is not imposed as punishment might nonetheless violate the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.230" offset="12708025">Justice Stevens asked... well, I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.303" offset="12720251">I have one other point I want to go to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.677" offset="12729759">I want to go back to whether or not there is any difference between damages and injunctive actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.463" offset="12752956">Now, the first point and I think the central point is that the Eighth Amendment standard for either injunctive actions or damages actions is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.418" offset="12784721">The standard under the Eighth Amendment is the same, but of course there are differences when one is speaking about damages with regard to special defenses that apply the damages and not injunctive actions, and--</text>

            <label>Justice Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="3176.297" offset="12836234">What authority do you have that 1983 liability, if we accept the standard you propose, would be limited so far as damages are concerned?</text>

            <text syncTime="3185.891" offset="12874582">--The major authority, Your Honor, that I would cite is the Youngburgh case, and that is where I wanted to go next.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.026" offset="12899137">Justice Stevens asked about the financial issues, and the prison officials in this case have made no claim at all that the reason that they failed to supply the necessities of life has to do with financial reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.858" offset="12958487">But let's assume that they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.098" offset="12963503">Then there would come a time when there would be a difference between damages and injunctive actions, because under this Court's decision in Youngburgh if a professional is prevented from doing his or her duty because of a lack of finances, then that is a defense in damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="3227.602" offset="13041452">It can't... you can't possibly apply that defense, of course, in injunctive actions, because if you did, and there was some question about isn't... shouldn't we look for deliberate indifference from someone.</text>
