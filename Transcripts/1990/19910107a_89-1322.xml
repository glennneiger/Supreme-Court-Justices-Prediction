            <text syncTime="184.269" offset="859005">And because the State taxation would infringe upon the tribe's right to govern itself within that reservation, those taxes were not allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.291" offset="895054">Here we don't have a reservation situation, as this Court has found in the Oklahoma Tax Commission v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.981" offset="925774">The situation in Oklahoma is much different.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.347" offset="935283">There are no reservations as such as are found in other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.920" offset="961614">And the facts of this case show that in 1891 there was a sum certain session agreement that this Court held in the DeCoteau case... found that those... that... this specific session agreement which was mentioned in the case did disestablish the reservations that were involved in that agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="233.868" offset="1057327">But the land on which this store is located is held in trust by the United States for the tribe, is that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="242.255" offset="1090868">The land... the particular land in this case was conveyed back to the... from the United States in 1961 and 1964 to the tribe in unrestricted status, in nontrust status, because the Federal Government did not want to maintain any supervision over the land because that would be too much trouble and expense for the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.505" offset="1187939">So they did not want to maintain the land in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.141" offset="1206434">In 1976, though, the tribe did want to build some public buildings and a community center, and they wanted to apply for loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.480" offset="1243841">The Federal... the Economic Development Administration for their protection wanted this land to be held in trust by the United States rather than in the tribe's own name.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.753" offset="1276860">So in 1975 that land was transferred in trust under Section 501, but that section... Title 25, Section 501 of the United States code.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.244" offset="1322835">But that section doesn't set up any reservation status for the land, and it is my position that the... in order to create a reservation, the Congress or the President of the United States must act to do that, and I don't think that's been done in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.967" offset="1565774">Not... these are lands that are for the tribal headquarters and a golf course and public buildings here.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.907" offset="1601510">But at any rate, even on a reservation the tax laws of the State of Oklahoma would apply to the transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.565" offset="1656158">And I think as we have seen in the population statistics that were located in our brief, we can see the assimilation of this tribe into the general community, and it's safe to say that most of the sales from this tribal store are not to tribal members.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.711" offset="1740690">But I think the cases of Moe and Colville clearly stand for the State's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.734" offset="1776843">And I think the Mescalero point... the Mescalero case goes on to say that tribal businesses that are located off the reservation are subject to the same State laws as all other businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.378" offset="1847374">And I think in that Mescalero case, in note 11, the Solicitor argued in that case that that land was virtually held in trust for the tribe in that situation, although it was a lease from the Department of Interior I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.173" offset="1918532">However, it would have been useless to transfer the land in that situation, so that was in effect trust land in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.529" offset="1951968">So I believe this case is on point when you look at the cases of Oklahoma Tax Commission v. United States along with the Mescalero case.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.718" offset="1988749">I believe that the Federal intent in Oklahoma was not to create this kind of situation, and clearly Congress did not want to go back to the reservation situation when they were passing the Indian Reorganization Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.214" offset="2078714">They wanted to exclude Oklahoma from that and pass a separate act for Oklahoma because Oklahoma has gone past the reservation system, and I think that was... yes?</text>

            <text syncTime="1092.701" offset="4492638">Back in 1932 that case involved a lawsuit by the United States to protect tribal coal royalties that were owed to the tribe and the tribe was held to be immune from a counterclaim in that suit because the United States Government was trying to protect the fragile existence of the tribal ward, and it was necessary in that circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.072" offset="4618130">I think, however, the scope of the tribal entity has increased greatly from those days and they are not reaching into the community of the State where State laws do apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.783" offset="4693049">I think this is quite a drastic change and requires us to look again at the sovereign immunity doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.656" offset="4732546">Now I'm not saying that sovereign immunity of an Indian tribe should be abandoned for all purposes or that it would be... should be absolutely abrogated in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.749" offset="4796912">I'm just trying to accommodate the interest of the State and the interest in collecting the taxes from the State citizens who are properly taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.639" offset="4840484">The sovereign immunity, I believe, is a limited sovereign immunity for an Indian tribe which should be limited to, properly, the tribal courts and the internal and social relations of the tribe certainly, and in the tribe's commercial area, where they are dealing with people who stand on maybe a different footing in the State of Oklahoma, I can see where they could assert sovereign immunity in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.954" offset="5037656">But here we don't... we aren't dealing with a consensual relationship as such and we are faced with a situation where we are trying to get the tribe to cooperate with the tax laws of Oklahoma, which we feel, under previous decisions of this Court, that we have a right to have them administrate on our behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.223" offset="5150819">I think this Court has found that that administration is such a burden on the tribe that it would infringe tribal self-government, and we certainly recognize the government of the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.947" offset="5197630">But I believe that the sovereign immunity of this tribe does not go so far as to displace these valid State laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.487" offset="5239844">And I believe that that's what the tribe, as differentiated from how the sovereign immunity doctrine has been used in the past, this tribe is using the sovereign immunity doctrine to evade valid law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.813" offset="5293134">I will reserve the balance of my time.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="1299.916" offset="5321555">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.326" offset="5379234">It is the position of the United States in this case that the Court may dispose of the case by application of three settled principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.082" offset="5410163">First that Federal law affords Indian tribes immunity from all suits except where Congress has expressly consented to such suits or the tribe waives its immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.938" offset="5449660">Second, that States may not tax sales of goods on an Indian reservation to members of a tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.543" offset="5480066">And third, that States may tax non-Indians who purchase goods from an Indian tribe or member of a tribe on an Indian reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.816" offset="5517160">The first of these points arises in connection with the Tax Commission's counterclaim against the tribe in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.570" offset="5544118">The tribe concedes that that counterclaim is barred under existing law, under the existing rule of Federal sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.791" offset="5569092">But it urges the Court to modify that rule or to abandon that rule in the context of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.945" offset="5589676">But this Court has said on several occasions that it is up to Congress to modify... excuse me... tribal sovereign immunity where Congress believes that that is wise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.051" offset="5630114">And it is Congress that could best take into account the various competing considerations: the infringements on tribal sovereign that might be implicated, the economic consequences for a tribe in exposing it to not only the cost of litigation but adverse judgments.</text>

            <text syncTime="1414.590" offset="5780265">Now, the Court made clear in Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez that tribal sovereign immunity extends only to the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.910" offset="5805552">It does not protect... under a rational analogous to Ex parte Young, does not protect tribal officers from suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.564" offset="5832092">So in this case the manager of the tribal store or other persons responsible for operating it would not be protected by sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.485" offset="5859782">Now there may be a question as to what forum such a suit could be brought in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.753" offset="5872843">But as the... as we read the tribal code, the tribal court, for example, would be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.625" offset="5900429">But in any event the Tax Commission has not tried that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.061" offset="5910146">Also, although the Tax Commission argues here that it has no ability to enforce its law against wholesalers shipped from out of State even though it concedes it's coming from instate, that just happens to be the arrangement of Oklahoma law at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.904" offset="5969496">It's possible that Oklahoma may be able to amend its law to impose a duty on wholesalers who ship from out of State or consign shipments to shippers who bring them into State to impose the tax stamps on the cigarettes in the same manner that it currently requires of wholesalers who have a place of business in the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1484.684" offset="6060612">In our view the proper course for the Court to follow would be to affirm the tribe's own immunity from suit and to vacate that... and therefore affirm the dismissal of the counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.623" offset="6104393">But with respect to the tribe's suit for affirmative injunctive relief, we think that all the Court really needs to do here is to vacate the injunction that the court of appeals ordered, premised on the view that it's a substantive matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.764" offset="6148905">The tribe did not have to collect the tax on the sales to non-Indians or Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.335" offset="6167191">As we explained in our brief the court sought to distinguish this Court's holdings in Moe, Colville, and Chemehuevi that the State may collect taxes on the sales to the non-Indians on the ground that Oklahoma has not accepted jurisdiction under Public Law 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.742" offset="6224870">As we explained in our brief, however, Bryan v. Itasca County held that Public Law 280 does not confer taxing jurisdiction on States that accept jurisdiction under that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.367" offset="6263322">We think it follows that Oklahoma's refusal to accept jurisdiction under Public Law 280 does not withhold taxing jurisdiction from the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.204" offset="6294669">In other words, Public Law 280 is simply put to one side on the question of the State's authority to tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="2598.902" offset="10517519">If the State was truly concerned about litigating the issue of collection, there are other ways that they could have brought this issue to court besides the issue of direct tax assessment for which they have yet to survive... provide this Court with any authority to what action that they took.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.379" offset="10583348">If they wanted the Moe case or the Colville case, they could have taken actions that this Court has recognized in those cases that they could take since it's seizing cigarettes bound for the tribal reservation or what have you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2920.078" offset="11802221">The tax assessment was made to enforce this tax collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.148" offset="11822492">We... under the Moe and Colville decision, we believe we have the right to these taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.818" offset="11853108">We found no other way to enforce these taxes than by tax assessment in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.324" offset="11891142">It is my position that you cannot properly separate the collection of a tax from the enforcement of the tax, because as we have seen in this case the tribe will not collect if the only consequences of that is getting away with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.755" offset="11972853">So they have operated for many years without collecting with our... likewise with the State's inability to ever enforce those laws.</text>
