            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="10.780" offset="117025">This case comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and in it we are confronted with some rather complex procedural problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.100" offset="158298">Petitioner, Stevens who in his 60s, was subjected to an adverse personnel action by his employer the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.567" offset="192153">He felt that he had been the victim of age discrimination and he attempted to invoke his agency's administrative procedure for resolving a claim of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.977" offset="233844">He had got no where in that channel and then instituted suit in the Western District of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.906" offset="257564">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we hold that petitioner's civil action was timely under the applicable statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.343" offset="287343">We, however, do not address the question whether having filed an administrative complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.410" offset="311585">Stevens was required to exhaust his administrative remedies before filling his civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.871" offset="337394">We refrain from taking such a step because the government, in direct contradiction of its position before the Court of Appeals, now fully agrees with Stevens that exhaustion was not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.160" offset="386608">And thus, there is no one before us in an adversarial position to that of Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.515" offset="408029">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore, reversed and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.836" offset="437286">Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
