            <label>Chief Justice Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="74098">The opinion of the Court in No. 89-1817, County of Riverside versus McLaughlin will be announced by Justice O'Connor.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="10.055" offset="114222">This case follows from an opinion of the Court handed down in the case of Gerstein versus Pugh where this Court held that the Fourth Amendment requires a prompt judicial determination of probable cause following a warrantless arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.689" offset="204815">The respondent, Mr. McLaughlin, brought this class action suit under Section 1983 against the County of Riverside in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.430" offset="259776">The plaintiff's claim that County's policy governing probable cause determinations for persons arrested without a warrant violates the holding in the Gerstein case.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.731" offset="312962">Currently, Riverside County combines probable cause determinations with its arraignment procedures, and it offers the combined proceedings within 48 hours of arrest exclusive of weekends and holidays.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.696" offset="372834">Under this policy, persons arrested without a warrant could spend up to five or six days before receiving a probable cause hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.268" offset="411078">The District Court issued a preliminary injunction requiring that all persons arrested without a warrant be given a probable cause hearing within 36 hours of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.917" offset="457680">The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed holding that the County's policy was inconsistent with our holding in the Gerstein case which the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals read to require probable cause determinations immediately on completion of the administrative steps incident to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.680" offset="536779">In the opinion filed today, we hold that Riverside County is entitled to combined probable cause determinations with its arraignment proceedings, but that it must offer those combined proceedings within 48 hours or less following a warrantless arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.432" offset="607727">Weekends and holidays may not be excluded from this time limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.968" offset="625909">Combined proceedings offered within 48 hours will, as a general matter, immunize jurisdictions from class action suits challenging a systemwide policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.524" offset="672093">The 48-hour period does not provide jurisdictions with absolute immunity, however.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.546" offset="700201">A jurisdiction may still be subject to an individual lawsuit if the plaintiff can prove that his or her probable cause determination was delayed unreasonably.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.768" offset="745131">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.410" offset="775642">Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Blackmun and Stevens have joined; Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
