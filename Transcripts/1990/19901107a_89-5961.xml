            <text syncTime="1703.887" offset="6945257">There were five issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.500" offset="6951736">We have four issues presently before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.413" offset="6959364">Most of the time was spent with regard to the first issue, but I would like to first address the second issue which was the latter issue that was just brought to the Court's attention with regard to whether in fact Mr. Link and Mr. Parker in particular preserve the claim for which he now asserts that review should be granted or review should be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.246" offset="7042746">First and foremost, with regard to the sufficiency of the evidence, there were 22 issues raised on direct appeal, two of which impact with regard to this particular claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.212" offset="7078586">One of which was... had to do with the guilt portion of the trial and if you recall in the facts of this case I have to digress for a moment, there were three murders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.000" offset="7117770">The first murder was charged premeditated murder but there was also a charge... well, not a charge but the evidence went to a kidnapping and Mr. Link, on direct appeal, argued that the evidence was insufficient with regard to the Padgett murder to show the underlying felony of kidnapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.530" offset="7191853">There was no, and I repeat, there was no argument presented on direct appeal with regard to the sufficiency of the evidence to raise the guilt as to the Nancy Sheppard murder, which was the underlying felony of robbery.</text>

            <text syncTime="1786.163" offset="7274400">It was more to the idea that the... an instruction... there should not be instruction with regard to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.897" offset="7297388">It wasn't per se the underlying felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.059" offset="7310031">The second impacted issue on this which brings us to the attention of the robbery had to do with the penalty phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.696" offset="7340542">At the penalty phase Mr. Link argued that the death penalty override was improper because an aggravating factor had been improperly found, to wit, that the murder occurred during the course of the robbery and that's how the robbery became an issue before the Florida supreme court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.916" offset="7409401">The Florida supreme court in resolving this claim found that, yes, indeed, it concurred that the aggravating factor was not appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.352" offset="7443151">And I would submit to the Court a reading of the Florida supreme court's opinion reflects that it was not because the robbery was not proven but rather there was not a sufficient nexus for that underlying felony to support the aggravating factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.290" offset="7498949">In Florida with regard to finding aggravating factors, in particular the underlying felony, the Florida supreme court has indicated that you have to have a nexus between a robbery that occurs and applying that aggravating factor to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.419" offset="7551403">I would submit to you that technically robbery... there was robbery in this case... it was sufficient to go to the jury with regard to an alternative theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.414" offset="7583377">In fact, though, the record also reflects that the State prosecuted on premediated murder and very little reliance was made with regard to the underlying felony of robbery for the Nancy Sheppard murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.092" offset="7630084">The first time this claim came up, and it was not raised in terms of Stromberg but rather as to the sufficiency of the evidence, is in a rehearing petition after the Florida supreme court found and concurred that the aggravating factor was not appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.021" offset="7689852">And that argument now became a greater argument that in fact the sufficiency of the evidence was not there, therefore a theory of liability for which the defendant may have been convicted was not supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.630" offset="7740320">I would submit to you first and foremost that the opinion does not support that, but more importantly raising something for the first time before the Florida supreme court on rehearing does not preserve nor raise fairly the issue before the State's highest court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.980" offset="7797685">The record also reflects that collaterally this issue was not renewed or raised to make sure it had been preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.676" offset="7832480">It was not raised on appeal from the denial of a State court trial relief collaterally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.478" offset="7855677">And the first time it again arose was when the first habeas corpus petition was filed in Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.612" offset="7880232">And it was put in the posture of sufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.514" offset="7891830">The Federal district court in reviewing this claim found that there may have been confusion with regard to the Eleventh Circuit as to how it aired or looked at issues that were preserved via a rehearing petition before an appellate court on direct appeal and came down on the side that the issue was not preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.927" offset="7969466">The court did make some discussion with regard to Stromberg and why in fact, even if we got to the issue, it was not a violation of... a constitutional violation with regard to Mr. Parker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.036" offset="8013875">The State stands before this Court as the Eleventh Circuit found that this particular claim was procedurally barred because the highest State court had not aired it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3005.442" offset="12151566">The jury was so instructed to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.385" offset="12159298">The problem with this case is that we have an opinion by the trial court or an order by the trial court that does not fully explain what in fact he considered, not that he had to find, but what he considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.383" offset="12215305">But I would submit to you that he has presumed to have followed the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.935" offset="12225545">The State would urge, and if there are no further questions, that the Eleventh Circuit's opinion be affirmed that it is correct with regard to the procedural bar claim as to the Stromberg issue and that they were absolutely correct in applying Spaziano with regard to whether the Florida supreme court in this particular case properly overrode the jury's recommendation of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.731" offset="12328676">The standard to be applied is properly set out by the Eleventh Circuit, that we are not here as the Federal district court did to reinvestigate and present our change or our view of how the facts come out... should come out but rather to ascertain whether in fact the appellate court properly conducted its role.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.235" offset="12414671">In this instance I would say it has.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.566" offset="12423971">We ask that you affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.538" offset="12427942">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3081.433" offset="12455527">The... just so it's clear, the evidence of intoxication that was presented at the trial court level was uncontroverted and it came primarily from State witnesses who all said the defendant was high, flying, under the influence, drunk, stoned, what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.465" offset="12527625">So that was uncontroverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.785" offset="12532849">He took LSD, PCP, and drank 3 or 4 cases of beer in a 4-hour period, so the evidence is pretty strong about intoxication.</text>

            <text syncTime="3109.640" offset="12568271">That is correct; however, the judge... the law requires the judge to consider it and there's no evidence that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.595" offset="12596170">Particularly he knew enough to tell the jury about the nonstatutory mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.070" offset="12622084">He gave an instruction about it that didn't include any language that he had considered any of those factors in his, in his decision even though he considered virtually all of the nonstatutory mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.459" offset="12671612">Even ones that were not argued were presented to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.941" offset="12681538">I also wanted to correct one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.713" offset="12692614">Billy Long, the actual trigger man, the one who killed the Sheppard girl, was given a plea bargain to second-degree murder.</text>
