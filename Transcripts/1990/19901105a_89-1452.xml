            <text syncTime="15.893" offset="196226">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="20.462" offset="214512">The court of appeals in this case struck down a rule adopted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 1986 to eliminate the substantial market distortions and inequities among consumers that resulted from the prior system of vintage pricing for old gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.625" offset="287132">Old natural gas is gas that was dedicated to interstate commerce prior to the enactment of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.314" offset="321927">Although the regulatory history and market context of this case may be somewhat complex, the case boils down to straightforward questions of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.937" offset="368425">On each we submit the text of the act clearly authorizes the Commission to do what it did, but if there were any question on that, the Commission's actions, in our view, rest on a reasonable interpretation of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.262" offset="417744">Let me identify at the outset the two issues that are presented here, principal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.314" offset="437911">First is what I will refer to as the pricing issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.833" offset="447942">Sections 104 and 106 of the Natural Gas Policy Act authorize the Commission by rule or order to raise the ceiling price of any gas or any category of gas, as long as the Commission finds that the higher price is</text>
            <text syncTime="95.462" offset="514502">"just and reasonable within the meaning of the Natural Gas Act. "</text>
            <text syncTime="98.330" offset="525996">The court of appeals held that this language did not authorize the Commission to depart from the prior vintage pricing system for old gas, but instead permitted the Commission only to grant special relief from applicable ceilings where it believed warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.756" offset="591720">The court ignored the plain meaning of the statutory text, which contemplates price increases of general applicability.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.529" offset="618783">But beyond that, it also ignored the broad and flexible interpretation given to the just and reasonable standard by the Commission, by this Court in its classic rate making cases, Hope Natural Gas, Permian Basin, and Mobil Oil, and by the lower courts immediately prior to the adoption of the Natural Gas Policy Act and the incorporation of that language into the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.776" offset="699762">The second issue concerns the abandonment of service under Order 451.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.244" offset="721600">The court of appeals found fault with the provision in Order 451 that permits a producer of gas to abandon its sales to a pipeline or other purchaser where the purchaser is unwilling, after negotiations, to pay a higher price for old gas allowed by the order.</text>

            <text syncTime="193.291" offset="905816">The Commission's regulations specifically provide for the filing of complaints, and if a purchaser objected to a proposed abandonment on the grounds that the standards prescribed in Order 451 have not been met in the particular case, it could file a complaint and seek an adjudication of that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="222.178" offset="1021382">What the Commission... the standard for abandonment under section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act, the Commission may authorize abandonment if it concludes that the present or future public convenience or necessity warrants the abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.218" offset="1073522">And it also says after due hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.237" offset="1081568">And what the Commission concluded here that it was, that upon the occurrence of certain conditions subsequent, a producer would be authorized to abandon the gas service.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.176" offset="1117303">So what the Commission did was give particular content to the general statutory standard of public convenience and necessity in Order 451 itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.116" offset="1153143">And this Court has held in numerous cases that an agency, and particularly the Commission's predecessor, the FPC, may do that under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.138" offset="1185222">And then, upon the occurrence of those, satisfaction of those standards, the producer is permitted to abandon the sale of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.576" offset="1222943">There is, the pipeline has no right to an individualized hearing on the general standards that were promulgated by rule, because the pipelines and others had an opportunity to participate in the hearing afforded by that rule making.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.801" offset="1275814">What could be challenged in a complaint is whether the producer satisfied those conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.657" offset="1303295">Now there has also been a question raised as to whether there might be an opportunity for waiver of the general standards under the rule, and that is a procedure that has been referred to in several of this Court's cases discussing general stan... abandonment or similar, not abandonment, but similar generalized determinations under which parties may obtain rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.034" offset="1384797">And the Court has discussed those in several other cases, Storer and FPC v. Texaco.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.640" offset="1415204">But... in WNCN, for example, the Court noted that it had not resolved the question of whether a provision for waiver would be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.163" offset="1449267">And in fact it doesn't make a lot of sense in the context of this case, because what triggers the opportunity for abandonment under this, under Order 451, is the purchaser's refusal to pay the rate requested by the pipe, by the producer up to the new ceiling prescribed by Order 451.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.093" offset="1537039">In other words, what triggers abandonment under this order is a purchaser's refusal to pay a rate of general applicability that the Commission has prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.551" offset="1578835">The rates are, by their nature, items of general applicability that do not require, at least short of constitutional insufficiency, the opportunity for waivers or special exceptions, as under Permian Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.942" offset="1632438">So we don't believe that, that the nature, intrinsic nature of Order 451 and the pricing schedule, or ceiling set in place by that requires an opportunity for a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.417" offset="1674338">But if a pipeline or other purchaser thought that a waiver was nevertheless appropriate, as we point out in our reply brief, the purchaser would have an opportunity to file a petition under the general rules governing the filing of petitions under the Commission's regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.144" offset="1745183">And in fact, Williams Natural Gas argued in the court below that the Commission had authority under section 16 of the Natural Gas Act to grant a waiver from the provisions of Order 451 in appropriate circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.619" offset="1795129">Although Williams made a passing request for an exemption or waiver in its rehearing petition in these rule making proceedings before the Commission, that is not the right place for an individual pipeline or purchaser to request an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.410" offset="1842254">The proper procedure is to file a petition with the Commission, where the Commission can focus on the equities of the particular purchaser, outside of the context of adopting a rule of general applicability.</text>

            <text syncTime="441.419" offset="1898365">I think that what would be required is that the, that the purchaser would at least have to make a showing of pretty substantial reasons why an exception should be made to the general standards in Order 451.</text>

            <text syncTime="458.965" offset="1968477">So if I think that the, that the word hearing in 7(b) in that context requires an individualized hearing, it is not your contention that this waiver procedure through petition would necessarily satisfy it?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="477.342" offset="2042038">I mean, you say the waiver, the waiver procedure is available, but you are not arguing that that necessarily fulfills the requirement, if there is one, which you contend there is not, of an individualized hearing.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="490.317" stopTime="575.923">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="490.317" offset="2093865">--Well, not across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.138" offset="2113196">But in the context of this case, again going back to what this Court said in FPC v. Texaco, which concerned the same sort of argument about a right to a hearing under section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act; and what the Court said, it was fine for the Commission to weed out at the threshold, solely by virtue of not satisfying the standards and the rule adopted by the Commission, various private entities were applying for special relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.721" offset="2219566">But it left open the possibility of applying for a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.859" offset="2236076">I think the same thing would apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.125" offset="2241196">What the pipeline could not contest in such a hearing is the general standards set forth in the rule itself, because again, those were adopted after due hearing in the rule making proceeding on the order itself, which is again the conclusion the Court reached in FPC v. Texaco.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.702" offset="2303472">What the pipeline could request in such a waiver application would be to show that his particular condition so departed from the premises of the order that special relief was warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.259" offset="2353731">Now again, I am not in a position to speak on behalf of the Commission as to what its response would be to a particular waiver application.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.032" offset="2388735">My only point here is that the Commission's regulations do not foreclose it, and that none of the respondents in this case has pursued the procedure that would be appropriate under the Commission's regulations to present that claim.</text>

            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="575.923" offset="2436383">Mr. Kneedler, perhaps it isn't significant, but we are talking about kind of an abandonment of a particular customer, rather than abandonment of service in the sense of the supply of gas is, doesn't come off the market, it just goes to some other purchaser, doesn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="588.064" stopTime="674.503">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="588.064" offset="2484866">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.831" offset="2488000">In fact, under the good faith negotiation procedure set up by the Commission in Order 451, the producer cannot abandon, may not abandon until it has entered into a contract with another purchaser to purchase that same gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.221" offset="2541499">And the Commission deemed this to be an important protection in the public interest, public convenience and necessity, because it assures that the gas will be, will remain in the market and not be lost forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.096" offset="2580996">And it is that purpose that in our view lends considerable support to the Commission's approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.333" offset="2601999">Because not only, not only has the Commission determined from the overall needs of the market that it's proper to release that gas to a new purchaser under the circumstances, but even comparing the two competing purchasers, as it were, the existing purchaser and the new purchaser, the Commission has concluded that the, if the new purchaser is propared to pay more, or under more favorable circumstances for that particular gas, that the, that as between those two purchasers, the subsequent purchaser, market indications show, has a greater need for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.888" offset="2732193">And that... the Court, again in WNCN v. FCC, concluded that it is proper in circumstances for an agency to rely on the market to resolve questions of comparative need, or in that case, diversity of programming.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.314" offset="2793947">And so it is... and the Commission made that point on rehearing, relying on WNCN, that it is really the same sort of comparative needs of the two pipelines.</text>

            <text syncTime="748.052" offset="3124866">But beyond that the Commission concluded it would not make sense for the market as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.004" offset="3140644">Let me explain why that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.722" offset="3147540">The 90 percent... 90 percent of the contracts between producers and pipelines contained contract provisions, typically indefinite price escalator clauses, that would have allowed the price the pipeline was required to pay under existing contracts to rise to the new ceiling level.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.065" offset="3212951">That new ceiling level was and is above the market price.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.952" offset="3228415">And the Commission concluded that the market distortions it was trying to eliminate by raising the ceiling would be reintroduced if the market, if the price of old gas went from substantially below the market to substantially above the market, and that it would also be appropriate to mitigate the impact on individual pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.747" offset="3299677">And so what the Commission did was to say that as a prerequisite to collecting this higher rate, the producer would have to trigger negotiations with the pipeline to enter into a mutually agreed upon price.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.571" offset="3354952">Only if the pipeline refuses to pay a price up to the ceiling would abandonment occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.410" offset="3382329">In other words, only if the pipeline refused to pay a price that it was contractually obligated to pay under the escalator clauses could abandonment occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.016" offset="3420676">And so, contrary to the court of appeals' view of the good faith negotiation system, this is not one-sided or unfavorable to the, to the pipelines.</text>

            <text syncTime="879.268" offset="3649718">It's an estimate of the replacement cost, the long-term replacement cost of these supplies of old gas.</text>

            <text syncTime="896.229" offset="3717532">And in fact, the Commission also concluded, strongly reinforcing this, that the new price ceiling and allowing the prices to increase would elicit 11 trillion cubic feet of additional supplies of old gas, which would compete with new gas, bring down prices, and stabilize the market.</text>

            <text syncTime="919.428" offset="3810319">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="922.463" offset="3822544">The single dispositive point to which the respondents have no answer is that sections 104 and 106 of the NGPA specifically and unequivocally authorize the Commission to set a new ceiling price for old gas, so long as it is higher and so long as it is just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.543" offset="3906867">And that is all that has happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.562" offset="3914913">That is specifically what has happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.764" offset="3923690">And you have to ask yourself then, under those circumstances, what is it that FERC did that was wrong?</text>
            <text syncTime="952.716" offset="3943543">Our opponents' only real answer to that is that this amounts to de facto regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.203" offset="3961411">That is nothing more than substituting a label for what the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.190" offset="3981369">Moreover, Order 55 did not in fact deregulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.142" offset="3993176">What it did was to set a new ceiling, a higher ceiling, just as the statute requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.860" offset="4012089">But regardless of what happens to the market, in the event that it might go above the ceiling, that is still a ceiling and therefore still a regulated price.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.633" offset="4047197">The oft-repeated assertion that the effect has in fact been to increase the prices of old gas is totally beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.972" offset="4080529">Consumers do not buy old gas as such, and the price that consumers pay at the burner tip for the mix of old and new gas that they in fact buy has in fact significantly declined since Order 451.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.482" offset="4138521">And among the reasons that this may be the case are those that the Commission itself predicted, namely the 11 trillion cubic feet that would be at issue in the event that Order 451 were not enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.408" offset="4194319">That has two effects on the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.958" offset="4200484">One is it puts more gas onto the market, and the second is that the increment that it puts onto the market is low-priced to mix with the higher price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.097" offset="4232980">The contention that Congress relaxed the pricing structure only for new gas, while carrying forth the existing vintages for old gas, and that that was the compromise that Congress reached, is true as far as it goes, but it tells only half the story.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.190" offset="4297450">And the half that it leaves out is the half that is dispositive of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.511" offset="4314691">It is true that Congress itself did not alter the old gas ceilings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.463" offset="4330469">It simply carried them forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.681" offset="4335380">But in words that could not be more plain, in sections 104 and 106, it gave the Commission the authority to exercise its traditional NGA authority to decide just and reasonable ceilings, and to alter those ceilings in light of subsequently changed conditions in the event it chose to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.024" offset="4404761">So that the only issue, the only issue in this case is whether those rates are just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.947" offset="4432451">And it is an issue that is really not a proper basis for invalidating Order 451.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.934" offset="4464425">The Commission determined that they were just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.517" offset="4474665">The Fifth Circuit did not, did not disturb that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.271" offset="4489712">And the only argument that our opponents have as to why this is not just and reasonable is the one to which Mr. Kneedler referred, that the Commission said it would not be just and reasonable to charge that price without first going through a negotiation procedure whose ultimate effect would probably be and has been to get the price lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.934" offset="4576334">The claim that the Commission's GFN procedure is too one-sided simply ignores the central purpose of that procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.521" offset="4610711">The ceiling itself was borrowed from what Congress itself did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.008" offset="4632654">Moreover, it had been judicially approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.860" offset="4640072">So clearly, if that is all they had done, it would have been all right to charge up to that ceiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.329" offset="4657940">But they said that was not the just and reasonable procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.215" offset="4673509">First, as a condition to charging that higher price, the producer was required to initiate a procedure which might bring the price lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.155" offset="4709245">Now, in light of the fact that there were these price escalation charges, something like that negotiation process was absolutely essential, and in fact it has worked very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.396" offset="4758250">In the great majority of instances what has happened is that the parties have not used the GFN formal procedure, but rather have simply renegotiated their contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.235" offset="4789597">And the effect has been to eliminate not only the distortions on the lower end, the old gas price distortions over which Congress, excuse me, the Commission did have some authority, but also has been to bring the producers to the bargaining table and put the new gas on the bargaining table as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.232" offset="4873607">Now, the second major issue in the case concerns what kind of hearing is due under section 7(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.052" offset="4904849">We submit at the outset that this falls well within the Vermont Yankee Rule, that agencies enjoy particular deference with respect to their own procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.639" offset="4939227">There is a very good reason why the hearing that was due in this case was not the individualized one that the respondents advocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.847" offset="4980082">And that reason is bottomed on the FERC's governing substantive standard for abandonments, which is not challenged here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.333" offset="5009966">The old standard, which focused on the comparative needs of the two prospective parties to the contract, that is the one that would, then had the gas and the one that would get the gas in the event of abandonment, necessarily concentrated on the needs of the individual parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.664" offset="5083318">But the new standard is concerned not with comparative needs, but rather with the overall needs of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.901" offset="5108291">And as a result, the hearing that FERC held was not concerned with any facts relevant to particular companies or particular contracts, but rather with overall market needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.125" offset="5157192">The respondents have never really... well, they do not dispute the substantive standard, nor do they dispute that that substantive standard is not at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.850" offset="5204004">But they have never faced up to the interaction, the bearing that that unchallenged substantive standard has on the procedural argument that they are making in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.324" offset="5249979">Finally, the Court has held on several occasions that generic hearings do satisfy the statutory requirement that there be a hearing, and that is particularly appropriate in the context of this case, where the statute says due hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.969" offset="5324480">And that language is, by its nature implies a great deal of discretion in the Commission in determining what kind of a hearing is due.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.308" offset="5357917">What Mr. Kneedler said in response to Justice Scalia's question about whether there would be opportunity for not only consideration by the Commission, but also the hearing, even if we assume that an individualized hearing is required, which has not been decided really, and even if we assume that the Commission wouldn't grant it... and that has not yet been determined, that issue ought to be decided, if at all, at such time that anyone actually asks for a hearing... then you still have the question, or you still have the point that the proper remedy is simply to let them go back, and if they are entitled to a hearing, then FERC will be entitled, FERC will be obligated to give them a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.087" offset="5537013">But you don't upset the entire pricing provisions of Order 451 for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.074" offset="5564912">Mr. Chief Justice, unless the Court has questions, I have nothing further.</text>

            <text syncTime="1370.251" offset="5613604">This is not a basic rate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.851" offset="5624053">This case involves an effort by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to overturn the pricing and regulatory policies for natural gas prescribed by Congress in precise and detailed language set forth in the Natural Gas Policy Act and the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.713" offset="5687478">In Order No. 451 the Commission has taken three interrelated actions that are directly contrary to the plain language of those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.401" offset="5722273">First, the Commission upset the pricing policy of Congress embodied in title I of the NGPA by placing significant incentives for additional production of old gas for the expressed purpose of displacing any further development of new gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.344" offset="5789983">Second, the Commission removed virtually entirely any kind of regulatory rate control over old gas, and stated repeatedly in Order No. 451 that the purpose it had taken its action was to allow gas to be priced by the market, that is deregulate it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1518.097" offset="6205016">Now what should be made clear at first is that sections 104(b)(2) and 106(c) did not just carry forward the just and reasonable rate making authority that the Commission previously had had in the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.505" offset="6258619">It changed that authority by stating that the Commission could only raise rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.575" offset="6278995">It did not allow them to lower rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.094" offset="6289026">In the past, when the Commission could raise or lower, it could take a much more involved role in trying to make gas market-responsive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.617" offset="6323089">The limitation of its authority only to raise rates suggests that Congress had some different purpose in mind than in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.620" offset="6355168">The second thing is, the Commission itself repeatedly interpreted this provision to state that it required that, it provided an outlet, rather, for those producers whose actual costs of production exceeded the average ceiling prices set by Congress, and thereby would, without relief, have a constitutional, unconstitutional compensation through property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1629.901" offset="6652232">--And yet the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also ruled in Order 72 that one of the key components of the overall pricing scheme of the NGPA had been the continued availability of sections 104 and 106 to old gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.327" offset="6713986">Now what the Commission has done here in Order 451 is it has melded together approximately one-half of all of the pricing categories that Congress established, and it has set a rate that is equal to an incentive rate the Commission set under another provision of the NGPA, 107(c)(5).</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.324" offset="6793920">Now that provision states that the Commission can only when it is reasonably necessary set a new incentive based price for gas in this, in the 107(c)(5) case, that is produced at extraordinary cost or risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.465" offset="6850554">And in a prior proceeding the Commission determined that the ceiling price now set here in Order 451 represented such an incentive price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.671" offset="6887334">Now they say for gas that they admit is low-cost in production and does not involve extraordinary risk, it should get the same incentive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.693" offset="6915442">And it has thereby read 107(c)(5) right out of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.545" offset="6930802">But the bottom line is that whatever authority the Commission had in sections 104(b)(2) and 106(c), and they previously had said it was a special relief mechanism, they also have very clearly stated that it is not the authority to deregulate the price of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.007" offset="7000706">And that is in fact what they have done in this case, and let me explain why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.744" offset="7019618">There is no doubt in this case that there are no effective controls presently on the market actually setting the price of old gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.933" offset="7056399">The Commission has admitted as much in its reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.384" offset="7070192">It stated that at the present time, and I would submit, and the record establishes this, that since the rule was adopted this ceiling price has had no teeth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.324" offset="7105927">It cannot control what happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.859" offset="7116063">It allows the market to set the rate, and that is assuming if the GFN process works as intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.263" offset="7141663">But as Mr. Kneedler pointed out, the only way that a pipeline can be assured of actually keeping the supply of gas under contract is to agree to pay a price that the Commission itself stated would be unjust and unreasonable if automatically collected.</text>

            <text syncTime="1798.892" offset="7328177">But there are in some instances voluntary negotiations that have been at a market price, in other words a price that would have been established had this gas been deregulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.266" offset="7365689">However, there are many other instances where pipelines, some of whom are respondents in this proceeding, have offered to pay the market price and the producer has come back and stated that is not sufficient, and then cancelled the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.923" offset="7416366">Now, there is another point that bears repeating here, and that is that the agreement to actually pay the market price does not mean that any new gas will be produced from these existing production reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.048" offset="7460879">That of course was the whole point of the rule making, was to bring an additional 11 TCF to the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.619" offset="7483135">But if any change in the contract term is offered by the pipeline purchaser, that can be grounds for the termination of the contract by the producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.908" offset="7524304">So if the pipeline purchaser states to the producer that I will pay the new ceiling price, that is admittedly now nearly twice the spot market price for gas, but in return for that agreement I would ask that you agree to actually produce more gas from these reserves, that could be viewed as a change in contract terms and it would enable the producer to walk away from the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.840" offset="7611971">Furthermore, nothing in this rule even requires the producer to actually produce any more gas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1964.263" offset="7989702">And if they couldn't agree, then under the Department of Justice proposal, the producer would then file and seek expedited abandonment of the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="2798.680" offset="11327315">They did so for the express purpose, they said, of delaying production of new gas.</text>

            <text syncTime="2843.376" offset="11506097">And then, only 2 months before the Commission initiated this rule making, it stated in its block billing rule making proposal that old gas is not market-responsive specifically by legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.551" offset="11566805">And that legislative intent was that the price incentives be focused on new and hard-to-produce gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.455" offset="11590420">And then 2 months later it suddenly found that old gas should be priced at the market, and it offered no reason whatsoever why its statement 60 days before was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.245" offset="11629604">The bottom line is that the end result of the action taken just on the pricing mechanism is that old gas is now priced much higher than the average price of new and hard-to-produce gas that has been deregulated.</text>

            <text syncTime="3120.449" offset="12614420">The plain meaning of the statutory text here answers the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.233" offset="12629571">The Commission is expressly authorized to increase ceiling prices if they are found to be just and reasonable within the meaning of the Natural Gas Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3146.649" offset="12719223">--Well, first of all, what the Natural Gas Act provides, allows the Commission to set a rate within a zone of reasonableness, as the Commission has said in Permian Basin.</text>

            <text syncTime="3162.141" offset="12781186">And what the Commission has said is that because automatic collection of the higher price, not that it is a just and reasonable rate in the abstract, but that automatically allowing producers to charge rates above the market would distort the market, and therefore not be just and reasonable within the context of a rule that is trying to bring order and regularity to the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.805" offset="12863837">That's, that's the reason why the Commission has concluded that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3191.475" offset="12898528">I mean, can it say $30 is a just and reasonable rate, so long as somebody is willing to pay that?</text>

            <text syncTime="3205.301" offset="12953803">--No, because there is an important limitation here, and it is also the complete answer to the respondents' position that this price is deregulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.622" offset="12979089">The Commission did not pull the price out of thin air.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.407" offset="12990270">The price, the ceiling that all of this gas is subject to is the ceiling price for post-1974 old gas, which was carried forward by Congress itself in the NGPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.263" offset="13033738">That is a statutorily, statutory touchstone for this ceiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.333" offset="13049934">Also, it is important to reinforce the point that the Chief Justice made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.035" offset="13068742">If, if pipelines cannot purchase gas from the current producer, they can go out and get it at market from other producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.140" offset="13097163">Respondents have not identified any pipeline that has been unable to replace supplies by going to the market.</text>

            <text syncTime="3246.961" offset="13120464">Mr. Kneedler, can you help me on one concept on the abandonment part of the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.330" offset="13137914">Is it correct that under the rule that really two abandonments are approved on a wholesale basis?</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.067" offset="13156931">First, the shift to a different pipeline purchaser, and then the subsequent abandonment when the producer decides to go, to discontinue production.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.221" offset="13189532">Are both stages approved--</text>

            <text syncTime="3266.806" offset="13199876">The subsequent abandonment that is authorized is if the producer then chooses to sell it to yet a third pipeline.</text>

            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3274.746" offset="13231641">--What if the producer decides that it's no longer economic to produce gas from that particular well?</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="3279.849" offset="13252017">--Well, the Commission's position on that is that its jurisdiction does not extend to additional productions of gas from wells, that that is subject to State jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.003" offset="13284618">The Commission set that forth in the Northwest Central Pipeline case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.555" offset="13294858">And that is one of the reasons why the Commission concluded it was necessary to have a price incentive, to encourage producers to continue to produce old gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.727" offset="13323592">Otherwise 11 trillion feet of natural gas would have been lost, the Commission determined, to the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.715" offset="13347520">Respondents do not challenge that determination by the Commission, and has exhaustively talked--</text>

            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3307.167" offset="13361313">So this order doesn't, this order just doesn't deal with the problem of abandonment that we normally think of in other regulatory contexts of discontinuing production?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="3314.754" stopTime="3316.522">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="3314.754" offset="13391615">--Right, this is... this speaks of abandonment of sales.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="3316.522" stopTime="3317.155">
            <label>Justice Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3316.522" offset="13398720">Okay.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="3317.155" offset="13401228">And again, only in circumstances where the, where the pipeline is unwilling to pay the market-responsive price and a price that it is obligated to pay by contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.378" offset="13430172">I should also point out that this has been a hugely successful order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.580" offset="13446995">The market price of old gas at the end of 1989 exactly equaled the market price of gas generally, $1.69 per thousand cubic feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.019" offset="13484716">What this, this order has been a success in eliminating the distortions and the unfairness among consumers, and the long-time disparity with respect to replacement cost, and bringing this sort of order to a nationwide market that Congress wanted to have when it enacted the Natural Gas Policy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.981" offset="13552529">This Court said that the Commission's goal under that act is to assure adequate supplies at fair prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.884" offset="13576144">And surely a regulatory system that requires, in the end, pipelines to pay what the market will bear and producers to charge what the market will bear, with a touchstone to the market pricing system that Congress set loose in the Natural Gas Policy Act itself, is fair and it is also, within the meaning of the act, just and reasonable.</text>
