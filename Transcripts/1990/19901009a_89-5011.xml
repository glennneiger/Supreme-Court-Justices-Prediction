            <label>Mr. Robert L. Lane</label>
            <text syncTime="56.247" offset="346328">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="59.900" offset="360956">In 1986 this Court rendered its decision in the case of Batson v. Kentucky, a case involving a black defendant who objected to the State's use of peremptory challenges to exclude blacks from his jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.868" offset="404737">Batson reaffirmed the principle that the equal protection clause prohibits the removal of black prospective jurors on the basis of their race.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.452" offset="435144">The issue in today's case is whether a white defendant has standing under Batson to object to the State's use of peremptory challenges to exclude blacks from his jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.898" offset="476940">Approximately 1 year after this Court's decision in Batson, Larry Joe Powers stood trial on two counts of aggravated murder with death penalty specifications, and one count of attempted aggravated murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.298" offset="526468">During the jury selection process the State used 10 peremptory challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.230" offset="542246">Seven of those challenges were used to exclude blacks from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.313" offset="558546">The defense objected to these peremptory challenges and pointed out to the court that what the State was trying to do was to remove all the blacks from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.248" offset="590311">Neither the State nor the court refuted defense counsel's statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.820" offset="608597">The court overruled the objections, and the court failed to compel the State to put its reasons on the record, even though defense counsel had requested such a requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.457" offset="647154">Mr. Powers was ultimately found guilty, and he was sentenced to 53 years to life in the Ohio penal system, where he is today.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.632" offset="679859">Mr. Powers appealed his conviction to the Franklin County, Ohio, court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.597" offset="699712">In that appeal he argued that both his rights and the rights of those excluded jurors had been denied under this Court's decision in Batson by the State's actions and by the court's actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.983" offset="745270">The court of appeals rejected this claim and affirmed Mr. Powers' conviction, finding that Mr. Powers could not make a Batson claim because he was not the same race as those jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.951" offset="789155">Mr. Powers then raised the same issue in the Ohio Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.284" offset="806396">That court denied him discretionary review, finding that no substantial constitutional question existed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.139" offset="837848">For well over 100 years this Court has steadfastly prohibited racial discrimination in the criminal justice system.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.053" offset="869508">The Batson decision stands on three important values, values that are important to all criminal defendants regardless of their race.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.171" offset="909945">Among these values is the... that the Court has recognized, is the value that a democratic society cannot survive unless the people in that society have the faith and the confidence in the integrity of the criminal justice system.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan C. Travis</label>
            <text syncTime="1628.717" offset="6636195">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.440" offset="6647062">I think I would like to begin simply by addressing some of the questions raised by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.134" offset="6673812">I would note to the Court that this is not a novel proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.657" offset="6691888">As Mr. Lane has argued, and as this Court is fully aware, the use of peremptory... not peremptory, but the use of removal of individuals from the criminal justice system based upon race has been a violation of the Equal Protection Clause since at least Strauder, 110 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.009" offset="6765345">Just as that is not a novel proposition, I would suggest to this Court that Batson did nothing more than change the evidentiary standard which is required before an accused may make a challenge against the prosecution's use of peremptories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.160" offset="6833994">In this instance I think it is significant, and this Court has found it significant, that much of the argument presented by the petitioner in this case I think sounds of a Sixth Amendment challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.087" offset="6889688">In this instance we have a significantly different basis for the objections by the defendant, if they are coming out of the Sixth versus the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.347" offset="6934723">The issue which has been discussed with Mr. Lane, the necessity of a injury in fact to the defendant, historically, and certainly nothing since Swain has changed this, historically this Court has consistently and continually stated in equal protection cases that in order to show a violation of the equal protection rights of the accused he must show that he is a member of the distinct class, and that members of his class have been excluded from the jury service.</text>

            <text syncTime="1739.168" offset="7077978">I would say simply to the Court that if the statutory basis were brought, as the middle three opinions of that case suggested, that might be a basis for review or handling of this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.130" offset="7133880">But it was not brought in this case, nor was a due process clause claim brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.921" offset="7153002">Mr. Justice Marshall's lead opinion suggests that the issue involved due process and equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.707" offset="7180169">But as I read the opinion and as I believe the dissent points out, it was resolved as far as the lead opinion goes on due process grounds, and for the center three opinions, written by Justice White, on statutory grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.925" offset="7237012">I think that is significantly different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.026" offset="7245371">Certainly it is not what was brought by this petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.088" offset="7257701">Just as in Holland, a petitioner brought a Sixth Amendment claim, feeling he was foreclosed under Fourteenth Amendment grounds, and this Court found that while he had standing, he had no remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.447" offset="7307124">And the concurring opinion of Justice Kennedy suggested the contrary would be true under Fourteenth Amendment grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.361" offset="7330739">I think if it came up under the criminal prosecution of 243, perhaps if it came up under due process grounds, there might be a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.777" offset="7368460">But it did not, and we are taking the position that under the traditional view that this Court has had for equal protection cases, there is no injury in fact to this defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1997.167" offset="8110024">Quite simply, we take the position that the Equal Protection Clause does not grant standing to this particular defendant, but even if it were to, even if this Court were to conclude that those cases, that historic line of cases which has seemingly required a correlation between the defendant and the excluded juror, even if that series of cases were not what it appears to be and what it has appeared to be to so many lower courts, so many members... or so many members of the circuit courts, then I suggest, as Justice Kennedy raised in his concurring opinion in Holland, that in this case on this record it is not... we don't have a sufficient record in which to determine whether there was a prima facie case advanced at all by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.250" offset="8310331">What the Court indicated, and what Justice Kennedy, I should say, indicated in his concurring opinion is that in Batson, and I think this is true from a reading of the case, there is an inference of racial discrimination when there is a showing that members of the defendant's race have been removed from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.895" offset="8396848">At some point we reach the point where you can draw an inference of racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.897" offset="8416910">That inference is not present when you do not have a correlation between the excused juror and the class... and the defendant's class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.822" offset="8448571">If that correlation is not present, and if, as this Court has continually said, it is the burden of the defendant in this case, the movant, to establish from the record a prima facie case, then we suggest that the record is insufficient in this case, as we did in our Brief in Opposition, to determine that there was even a prima facie case made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.656" offset="8531954">For example, if we were to assume for purposes of argument that the venue of this case was in a or were in a jurisdiction in which the members of the black race were the overwhelming majority of the population, the mere fact that 7 of 10 peremptory challenges, and I am now referring to this record, were used to excuse citizens who happen to be black would not have any meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="2457.951" offset="9953119">I have... Your Honor, I have great difficulty with this entire series of cases in dealing with the difficult problem of racial discrimination, but at the same time recognizing that merely because the defendant accuses one of being racially discriminatory in a trial, that the defendant has suddenly reached a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.875" offset="10040786">For example, in this case, whether he misunderstood Batson or not, the very first peremptory challenge was challenged, if you will, by the defendant, the petitioner, stating that you simply cannot peremptorily challenge a member of a minority without giving an explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.928" offset="10117064">That was the attack made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.128" offset="10125841">That's the difficulty I think all of us have had with dealing with Batson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.002" offset="10141305">I note that the Court has today accepted Hernandez on the question of whether or not removal of Latinos in a case involving an interpreter, whether they would follow the literal interpretation of the court... the court interpreter would be a valid reason to object, and it would be a nonracial reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.388" offset="10238899">It has been a very difficult time, I think, for the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.690" offset="10256035">I think this Court will be giving further guidance, but yes, I have difficulty with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2541.476" offset="10287173">Well, if you do have difficulty, I would think you would have difficulty with Swain, too, even saying that you can challenge a prosecutor's systematic and... practice over a series of cases of excluding all Negroes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2560.107" offset="10361779">No, I would, no, I don't have... I'm saying that I think courts have had difficulty in knowing what a prima facie case is in the context of Batson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.183" offset="10394066">Some certainly have said if there is a strike and the jury pool is of minimal number of Afro-Americans, if there's a minimal number in the jury pool, then that might be a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.930" offset="10445057">Indeed it has been held a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.162" offset="10453939">That's why I say that in this case we don't have a sufficient record for this Court to determine that issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2602.686" offset="10532097">I think that at some point, and I think this Court has made it clear that you examine the totality of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.480" offset="10563235">I think I would concede quite clearly that if you look at things such as the prosecutors' or, in our position, defendants', use of the peremptory, immediately, for example, without any particular inquiry of the juror, the type of the questioning that is done, so forth and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.563" offset="10643588">I think it is a totality of circumstances, but I also argue strenuously to the Court that in this case it is the burden on the defendant to make that record, and he failed to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="2653.289" offset="10734494">I think perhaps that would be the... something that if I were sitting as trial judge I would, I would perhaps ask.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.422" offset="10763020">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.063" offset="10765528">I think that very well could be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.354" offset="10774723">But as I say, I think you have to look at the totality of circumstances in determining whether such prima facie case has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.400" offset="10802935">We would argue that in this case there is a significant difference between the Sixth Amendment fair cross-section analysis and the equal protection analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.487" offset="10855284">We have taken the position, as we indicate, that in this case historically the Court has always required a correlation which is not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.363" offset="10886736">But even if this Court were to determine, as was perhaps suggested in some of the dissent and concurring opinions in Holland, that that correlation is not necessary, I would also argue to this Court very strenuously that there is a need for the defendant to make his record, and it was not done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.715" offset="10964163">On that basis, unless there are further questions, I would conclude my argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="2729.508" offset="11039291">We have in this case 7 peremptory challenges out of 10 used to exclude blacks from this jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.652" offset="11063950">Defense counsel, without refutation by prosecutor or by the court, said that what the State is trying to do is to remove all blacks from this jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.959" offset="11101149">Second of all, addressing the criminal statute, 18 U.S.C. 243, that statute has its foundation, its basis in the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.256" offset="11150363">The statute was designed to implement those goals of the elimination of racial discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2770.084" offset="11201668">--It was not raised in the trial level, Your Honor, and again I would submit to the Court that this Court has recognized in Rose v. Mitchell that that is an ineffective way of eliminating racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.553" offset="11251510">Now, we did cite that statute in our analysis of Peters v. Kiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.525" offset="11271363">We cited it in the lower courts, and we talked about it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.478" offset="11283170">But this Court has recognized that that criminal statute will not eliminate racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.540" offset="11303441">That statute has been on the books for well over 100 years, and as this Court has recognized, racial discrimination still continues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.676" offset="11331967">And I would submit to this Court that unless every defendant, regardless of race, is granted standing to object to the prosecution's use of racial discrimination in selecting that defendant's jury, that racial discrimination will continue in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.355" offset="11390690">And that is a situation that this Court cannot condone nor tolerate.</text>
