            <text syncTime="70.623" offset="406562">The second issue is whether or not an estate under a survival action has a claim for decedent's economic loss when not otherwise recovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.398" offset="441670">The context of this case must be remembered because in Moragne what the Court did was to bring into the 20th century the maritime wrongful death cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.273" offset="481168">What it has also done by that case is to foreclose State remedies in the maritime jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1046.674" offset="4310719">It goes beyond just seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.477" offset="4318033">It is the ship owner's position that the pendency was what was required to be shown, as per Gaudet, simply by the use of that term by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.392" offset="4361605">I would point out that in the dissent in Gaudet, there the organ for the Court said that we have yet to decide who the beneficiaries are under this cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.859" offset="4407476">So that Gaudet is not a case that establishes that only dependents can recover this item of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.114" offset="4432554">And I have also cited to the Court Cohen v. Virginia, where the general expressions in one opinion do not necessarily control the very point when it comes to issue in another case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.881" offset="4471633">The ship owner also argues that the Jones... that is that the Jones Act preempts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.476" offset="4497964">And I pointed out that in the Harrisburg, that is definitely not the case because it overruled a seaman's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.790" offset="4519280">And more importantly, in Moragne the Court addressed the third anomaly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.372" offset="4537566">And the third anomaly was that longshoremen, who were relying upon the unseaworthiness claim, which is a seaman's remedy, were granted a wrongful death cause of action by relying upon State remedies in territorial waters, where Jones Act seaman, because it preempted the state law, was not allowed a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.088" offset="4616456">If a seaman died strictly from an unseaworthiness condition and not Jones Act negligence, then there would be no recovery in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.913" offset="4643728">And the Court in Gaudet, when it was referring to Moragne about the three anomalies, said that Moragne ended these anomalies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.899" offset="4687718">So clearly the Court was saying that the benefit was being provided to seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.643" offset="4706630">The same thing is addressed in footnote 12 of Moragne, where it is clear from that--</text>

            <text syncTime="1193.699" offset="4898892">The second issue in this case is whether or not an estate has a claim for a decedent's economic loss when not recovered by loss of support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.557" offset="4930343">It's opposition that there is clearly a survival action under the general maritime law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1222.456" offset="5013935">And by that I mean is that had he lived his normal life there would have been an estate at the end of that life that would have gone to his beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.792" offset="5051238">And that is all the Evich court has done, is put that person back where he was before, that there would have been an estate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2561.729" offset="10371022">Justice Stevens, I would only point you to a case, Fifth Circuit, matter of S.S. Helena, 529 F. 2d 744, where it specifically held that a State wrongful death statute was preempted by the Moragne cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.557" offset="10426297">Also in Truehart they referred to a Supreme Court case, East River Steamship, found in 476 U.S.--</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.433" offset="10453778">What I would respond as far as the loss-of-society damage claim is that the lower courts have in fact recognized a seaman's claim for this item of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.870" offset="10499545">It is clearly recognized for injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.683" offset="10506755">What we are asking is that it be recognized certainly for wrongful deaths under the general maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.898" offset="10527653">Even this defendant did not raise that issue in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.768" offset="10543117">It wasn't an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.860" offset="10547506">The only issue was dependency, whether or not dependency had to be established before loss of society damages could be had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.537" offset="10578226">Also, the respondent relies upon Gillespie and Lindgren, but the commentators have all pointed out that those cases have been overruled by Moragne through the... the wording used in the language there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.066" offset="10636322">The commentators clearly recognize that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.448" offset="10641860">We as practitioners have recognized it, because we always, when we are dealing with an admiralty case, is link up the general maritime claim on the admiralty side of the court with the Jones Act claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.637" offset="10690657">The Jones Act was passed in order to expand seamen's remedies, not to limit them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.701" offset="10710928">It certainly wasn't meant by Congress to do away with the general maritime causes of action that a seaman has under that area of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.077" offset="10744364">This Court recognizes, no doubt, that seamen are the wards of this Court, that it is better to give the remedy--</text>

            <text syncTime="2756.480" offset="11149994">Well, actually it is interesting because they are saying there is no general maritime cause of action, yet Justice... Judge Rubin recognized that they had a cause of action under general maritime law against the union, despite all of the congressional acts dealing with unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.091" offset="11212479">And that didn't preempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.774" offset="11219166">And certainly the Jones Act and DOHSA don't preempt as far as the general maritime claims are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.627" offset="11246542">As far as the estate's claim, I think it's important to recognize that those damages place that estate back to where it would have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.085" offset="11296384">And what Evich court was saying was going back to the old common law principle that the wrongdoer does not benefit from his wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.591" offset="11326477">And for that reason those damages should be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.646" offset="11338702">It may be a peculiar item of damages, but in... under the admiralty law there are other peculiar items.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.151" offset="11360645">There is limitation of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.633" offset="11366601">There is general average.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.193" offset="11372870">There are rules in the admiralty courts that certainly are unusual, and there should be no reason why this element of damages should not be allowed under a survival action, especially given the interpretation that it is better to give the remedy than to deny it, and the humane and generous character of the admiralty law that has long been recognized by this Court.</text>
