            <label>Mr. Kneland C. Tanner</label>
            <text syncTime="15.286" offset="164551">May it please, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.214" offset="176253">These cases are here on certiorari from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.226" offset="216273">The petitioners are complaining of judgments for damages which were entered against them in the District Court of Oregon in suits brought by the respondent to enjoin the picketing of respondent's vessel the S.S. Riviera.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.730" offset="314284">The ship, at the time of the picketing by the petitioners, and for more than a month prior to the activities of these petitioners, was moored at the dock in the Willamette River in the Port of Portland.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.329" offset="388681">No claim has been made by the respondents that the activities in and of themselves and dissociated from their objectives were illegal either under Oregon law or federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.778" offset="486484">The picketing was peaceful.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.966" offset="499231">It occurred on the dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.713" offset="510203">There was no trespassing and it was unaccompanied by violence, threats or intimidation of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.574" offset="553671">Indeed, when the picketing was commenced by Benz of the Sailors' Union Pacific, the respondents went in to the state court with an application for an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.893" offset="646980">And their application, a-- a demurrer was interposed to their complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.763" offset="674461">The demurrer was sustained and they then filed an amended complaint to which a demurrer was sustained and the amended complaint that -- that they then filed is -- was in substantially the same form that was filed by the respondent against Benz in the Federal District Court invoking the jurisdiction of that Court by reason of the diversity of citizenship and the necessary amount in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.410" offset="844988">The -- the District Court -- the Federal District Court thought that the activities of the pickets were wrongful by reason of the mental processes or the objectives of the pickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.445" offset="925132">He thought that their objectives were unworthy of attainment, and issued a temporary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.485" offset="969331">The picketing stopped upon the issuance of the injunctions and the vessel signed on a new crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.918" offset="1007052">This -- their crew that brought the vessel into Portland on the 3rd of September had been discharged by the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.296" offset="1068596">That is, the unlicensed personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.203" offset="1080195">I think there were some five or six licensed officers still aboard the ship, but the unlicensed personnel had been discharged.So that the vessel was there in Portland without a crew and there were some 23 or 25 jobs available.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.091" offset="1191685">An -- an appeal was taken from this temporary injunction pursuant to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.447" offset="1221151">But the Court of Appeals thought the controversy with respect to the injunctions had become moot because the vessel, after it had attained a new crew and I think this new crew was employed in the vicinity of Vancouver, they were employed on the West Coast and they were put aboard the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.392" offset="1312893">And the ship had sailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.584" offset="1321671">So, the Court of Appeals thought that so far as the injunctions were concerned, the controversy had become moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.956" offset="1355212">And we applied to this Court for certiorari and our application was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.053" offset="1383633">The cases were then consolidated for trial on the merits and upon the issue of damages with the provision that it was to be tried without prejudice to the rights of the defendants in the case, the -- the petitioners here, with respect to urge the question of the -- the jurisdiction of the Court in the premises not only to -- to assess damages or jurisdiction in the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.055" offset="1519574">I assume that was what the reservation was intended for.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.769" offset="1538487">Now, the -- the trial court, on the basis of the trial court's decision, was apparently based upon a -- a doctrine that has drawn up, it had its beginning, I -- I believe, in the interpretation of a -- a labor dispute under the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.015" offset="1639424">Some of the courts felt that if the objectives were unworthy of attainment, as the controversy ceased be a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.495" offset="1697311">And so the trial court made the question of the objectives of these petitioners, the important matter upon which the -- apparently the trial court had based its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.581" offset="1785710">Now, the findings followed very closely the allegations of the respondent's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.417" offset="1817057">And in that complaint, the respondents alleged that the defendants and the persons represented by them have picketed and cause to be picketing the ship and now I quote from this, what appears on 484 of the record, wherein it says, "Whereby the employees of independent contractors with whom the plaintiff had contracts had been persuaded and induced not to carry on their work aboard said vessel."</text>
            <text syncTime="474.474" offset="2001272">How, that language means and can only mean that these pickets had persuaded the employees of independent contractors to strike against their employer for the purpose of inducing their employer not to do business with the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.162" offset="2087999">And that, I submit, was one of the things that Congress wanted to reach when it proscribed certain objectives that they thought were not conducive to harmonious industrial relations.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="511.912" offset="2151006">Where is that allegation again, Mr. --</text>

            <label>Mr. Kneland C. Tanner</label>
            <text syncTime="513.679" offset="2158111">At page 484.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.082" offset="2171695">And then again in paragraph 5 of the complaint, and that's found on page 486 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.844" offset="2222791">We find this significant allegation which I think aids in interpreting what they meant when they said they had persuaded employees of other employers to go on strike or that is not to work for their employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.511" offset="2293426">They alleged that Benz and his associates -- they -- they alleged that as a result of the picketing of the Steamship Riviera by the defendants on each of them the vessel has been idle since September the 26th, 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.874" offset="2402826">And they alleged that the employees of contractors with whom the plaintiff had entered into contracts for the repair and preparation of the vessel to carry her cargo of grain to India have refused to perform their duties on board the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.812" offset="2466670">And the plaintiff has been unable to carry out its obligations under the charter party and its right to pursue the vessel's voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.619" offset="2501883">Now, that that allegation would indicate that the picketing had that result and that the picketing was in or did, in fact, persuade.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.202" offset="2556217">Now, with respect to the intent to persuade are the mental processes of the objectives, the Court made that abundantly clear in its findings and conclusions which appear on page 241 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.676" offset="2630092">And we think this is of paramount importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.488" offset="2645347">On October the 14th, that was when this picketing commenced, members of the -- and I'm quoting now from the findings, "Members of the Sailors' Union of the Pacific acting pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the union, commenced picketing the vessel and continued to picket it until restrained and enjoined from further picketing by this Court on November 26, 1952."</text>
            <text syncTime="667.938" offset="2775124">That?s in findings of fact number 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.113" offset="2799783">And then on that -- on the following page, we have the Court's finding with respect to the specific intent wherein the Court said, "The said picketing by members of the Sailors' Union of the Pacific was intending to prevent the loading of the S. S. Riviera.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kneland C. Tanner</label>
            <text syncTime="709.396" offset="2940949">Finding 11, finding of fact 11, on 241 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.476" offset="2961324">Now, I have probably omitted some other findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.435" offset="2985148">I want, and I'm going to come back to some of these findings but because I thought they were somewhat contradictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.720" offset="3018271">The resolution which the Court found motivated the picket's ends, to which I think we have to look to, to find out what their objectives were, shows the motives which prompted the activities of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.883" offset="3086921">And those motives, that resolution itself is found on page 416 and 420 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.709" offset="3118164">It was made a pretrial exhibit and it was probably made the basis, I think, of the Court -- of the lower court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.300" offset="3156616">It was made a part of Benz's as affidavit on opposition to the respondent's application to temporary injunction as we thought that that clearly showed a labor dispute that they were trying to further their economic interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.403" offset="3204995">The resolution which they, which the Court did find, motivated the picketing of the vessel it described the conditions aboard the ship which made the vessel clearly unseaworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.745" offset="3266330">It referred to the suicide of one of the crew while the vessel came along inside the dock in Portland because, so the resolution stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.510" offset="3325367">This crew member preferred a quick death to the slow suffering death which he felt would be his fate if he stayed aboard the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.505" offset="3361416">And then it also recited the request which the crew had made of the Sailors' Union for assistance before they were put off the vessel by the order which the respondent obtained from the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.984" offset="3415333">It referred to the action of the immigration authorities in putting the men in jail immediately after they came ashore and later ordering them to deport.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.806" offset="3458591">Now, these orders of deportation were made prior to this picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.515" offset="3477400">These orders of deportation were made October 8 and 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.196" offset="3496208">Some five days before the picketing of this union commenced and for which the Court allowed Benz as against these petitioners, the concluding recital of the resolution of which preceded the resolution, we think, is also significant because it, too shows an economic interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.475" offset="3589308">Whereas, this company, because of the conditions that existed on board the S. S. Riviera and the way it has treated the crew of the S. S. Riviera, and the low wage rate it is paying on other ships operated by it, is unfair to the Sailors' Union of the Pacific and other legitimate seamen unions all over the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.415" offset="3677080">Now, and that the Court did make in paragraph 12 of the Court's findings, a finding that I think they're relying on here and expect, I assume they have to justify this judgment, it seems to me that they have to expect this Court to ignore these other findings, because in these findings it says, the Court said, this is found on 242 of the transcript, its Finding 12, paragraph 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.885" offset="3810931">The sole purposes of the said picketings by members of the Sailors' Union of the Pacific was to compel the plaintiff to reemploy said discharged striking members of the crew of said S. S. Riviera for a shorter period and that's stated in the articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.083" offset="3883656">And that wage rates and other conditions that were more favorable to them than those stated in the articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.231" offset="3916257">Now in view of the fact that this -- this member of the crew had been put off the ship, they had been ordered deported, it seems to us that one would have to have greater insight into the future to attribute to these seamen, that this order of deportation would be reversed by the Board of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.272" offset="4016462">It was and it had been reversed prior to the making of this finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.430" offset="4041122">It was reversed on November the 28th.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.837" offset="4062751">But at the -- but at the time this picketing commenced, these men had been ordered deported and it was clear that from the other findings that and from other testimony that they were furthering their own economic interest because that crew had been ordered deported, some 23 of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.400" offset="4164942">And they were off the ship and the owners were -- would of necessity, have to employ a new crew while -- because the vessel was there along the side of the dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.057" offset="4211649">Now, the judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals and apparent, along on the authority of this Court in Laburnum.</text>

            <text syncTime="1205.817" offset="4926673">The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment upon Laburnum and I think the United Construction Workers case versus Laburnum and I think in that case there was a gross misapprehension of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.086" offset="5015698">The Court of Appeals thought that because the picket that had caused damage for which no remedy was provided by the National Labor Relations Act, it concluded from that fact, the fact of causing damage that -- that the pickets and their activities were wrong and they held that it -- and as Laburnum said, they -- even though those activities might -- and constitute an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.203" offset="5188211">Now, Laburnum failed to distinguish, as the Court did in distinguishing Laburnum, it failed to ascertain that in Laburnum, the activities in and of themselves were tortious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.469" offset="5273266">There was -- the activities were wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.818" offset="5286640">That's why Laburnum was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.877" offset="5306911">Here, if they're wrongful at all, it's wrongful because of their mental processes, their hopes, their aspirations, their objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.432" offset="5361142">Now, I think in this Court's case in -- in the -- in this Court's opinion in Weber versus Anheuser-Busch, they make it very clear that if the activities are lawful, if the -- if the things that they do are not tortious their -- their activity or their objectives -- those objectives that are wrongful are the ones that commerce has proscribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.080" offset="5547656">And I think there was some five of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.071" offset="5567613">It's -- it was for the Congress in our view of the law, to make raw -- to determine the wrongfulness of objectives and they didn't say -- the Congress didn't say that it was a wrongful objective to represent a mutinous crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.112" offset="5663848">So, you can accept that finding as we view the law and say that they were as -- it's been argued at great length in their brief that this mutinous crew that this finding says, we were wanting to represent were so unworthy of representation that they were not entitled to have a representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.372" offset="5740857">And in -- and they made that objective a wrongful act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.645" offset="5761964">Now, if Congress had wanted to let these courts determine the rightfulness or wrongfulness of the objectives, they could have done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.584" offset="5805746">They -- they knew how to say that certain objectives were wrongful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.997" offset="5827375">And they -- they set it out very clearly that if you -- these concerted activities on inducing people to strike to accomplish certain objectives if -- if those objectives are for the things that Congress has proscribed, then, it becomes actionable on unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.496" offset="5905324">But I don't think it's for the courts to set their standards of the reasonableness, of the hopes and ambitions or the objectives of the pickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.285" offset="5980557">And I think this Court made that very clear in the New Negro Alliance case, the one they were construing the -- the Norris-LaGuardia Act that this question of a labor dispute was not to turn on the merit or lack of merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.010" offset="6035414">They had defined the labor dispute in pretty clear terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.626" offset="6049834">And so here, we believe that the Congress has proscribed certain things that the Congress thought were not worthy of attainment, were not conducive to industrial -- good industrial relations and they proscribed picketing and activities that were -- that had those things as an objective.</text>

            <text syncTime="1624.328" offset="6600704">And I think that was made abundantly clear by -- Justice -- the late Justice Jackson and it was quoted with approval and I -- I think that that is at this paragraph shows the, what we believe is the proper construction of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.256" offset="6676355">And I'm reading from this -- from Justice Frankfurter's opinion wherein he quoted Justice Jackson's opinion in the Garner case and this is what we think is the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.890" offset="6726928">The detailed proscription of the procedure for restraint of specified types of picketing would seem to imply that other picketing is to be free of other methods and sources of restraint and that includes, of course, restraints by the state court injunctions and federal judges sitting in diversity cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.494" offset="6833298">For the policy of the National Labor Management Relations Act is not to condemn all picketing but only that ascertained by its proscribed processes to fall within its prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.109" offset="6903829">Otherwise, it is implicit in the Act that the public interest is served by freedom of labor to use the weapon of picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.235" offset="6944266">For a State to impinge on the area of labor combat, designed to be free is quite an obstruction, if -- as much an obstruction of federal policy as if the State were to declare picketing free for purposes or methods which the federal Act prohibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.493" offset="7025351">And we think there was enough in this case to bring it within the purview of the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act and it was for the Board to ascertain what those objectives were and not for the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1928.736" offset="7818324">I do think the findings as made by the District Court control here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.248" offset="7836400">Some of them were attacked in the Court of Appeals, but the Court of Appeals disturbed none of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.015" offset="7859388">And they are thus findings which have passed the two courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.640" offset="7885928">Now, this key finding, as to the purpose of the picketing, needs a little background for understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.517" offset="7925426">The Riviera had a crew of foreign nationals, German and British mostly, who had signed a British form of articles providing for service for a period of two years or until the vessels returned to a European Port.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.289" offset="8004524">Those articles were in effect when the ship reached Portland, Oregon and had only been in effect for some four or five months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.936" offset="8047156">The crew of the vessel, after that the ship had been in port for a few days, went on a strike, a sitdownstrike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.420" offset="8093027">A specific plea refused to obey the orders of the master to continue about their normal duties aboard the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.565" offset="8121657">They refused his order, if they were not going to do that, to leave the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.162" offset="8144018">They were removed from the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.612" offset="8153840">They left voluntarily but only after an order of the District Court had been entered upon a possessory libel l which was filed by the respondent, ordering them to leave the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.554" offset="8205563">Now, it is true that they were then had taken into custody by immigration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.664" offset="8230013">But I want to point out on page 18 of the record among the agreed facts in this case was the fact, and I'm quoting at all times said, "Immigration and Naturalization Service was willing to allow voluntary departure by said crew members aboard the S. S. Riviera if reemployed aboard that vessel."</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.407" offset="8312978">So, I think this argument that the unions couldn't possibly have been picketing for their reemployment falls on that agreed fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="3355.659" offset="13525974">And that was the illegal purpose that was found by the -- the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.145" offset="13547917">I think you can all see as far as this foreign situation is concerned, that if -- if everytime a ship comes into this, the ports of the United State, it must renegotiate its articles, raise or lower its wage scales, change its working conditions according to our standards even if it must fall pause enough to select a collective bargaining agent under the machinery of the National Labor Relations Act as amended that there's going to be not a clearing of obstructions to commerce and its free flow but a tremendous hindrance to shipping of those foreign countries and quite likely a retaliation against our ships in their ports.</text>

            <text syncTime="3537.326" offset="14252701">There's a question here as to whether the act affords the respondent any remedy which is raised by the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.195" offset="14280182">They claimed that this was secondary picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.545" offset="14289586">They cite no authority in support of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.729" offset="14298258">In fact, the one case they do cite says picketing in a situation like this is primary since the ship is a transitory site as of the shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.801" offset="14334621">But I would like to point out that we have here suits against individuals, not against the labor organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.394" offset="14364923">That is, the judgments which are now in effect as modified by the Court of Appeals run only against the individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.754" offset="14390418">And while a secondary boycott is an unfair labor practice under the Act, the Act only provides a remedy against labor organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.922" offset="14435035">It provides no remedy against individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.721" offset="14446216">It merely says that any person who is injured by a secondary boycott may bring an action for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.915" offset="14487071">That if he does and its against an organization, then the judgment shall be in such and such a form and enforceable in a certain way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.722" offset="14518209">But it says nothing at all about suits against individuals and it is certainly permissive even as to the right to bring that type of suit against organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.146" offset="14555930">There have been lower federal court cases holding that the organizations themselves may still be sued by other procedures.</text>
