            <text syncTime="12.720" offset="154206">That the Army had leased them after they were completed to a succession of terminal operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.741" offset="194330">There's no dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.528" offset="197465">I might add that these facilities are suitable terminal facilities in every sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.766" offset="226408">They're large.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.594" offset="229752">They're well equipped.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.774" offset="234454">They have mechanical loading and unloading equipment and an abundance of warehouse space.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.788" offset="270503">Now, while the carriers have served these piers uninterruptedly, they have had from the first what may strike the Court as a rather unusual arrangement with respect to providing these port services to the shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.249" offset="344377">The best way to describe it, I think, is to borrow from the language of antitrust and to refer to it as a tie-in arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.731" offset="386278">And it is this arrangement which is a kind of but-for cause of the controversy which ultimately arose in World War II and then repeated itself in the Korean period.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.216" offset="448240">One would normally expect, I think, that carriers would charge a line-haul rate for delivering freight cars to a terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.675" offset="490036">And that thereafter, the shipper would pay a separate charge for the unloading and for the use of the pier to the terminal operator whoever he might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.190" offset="552103">That is common at most ports, but in a number of the North Atlantic ports this tie-in practice was initiated in the 1920s.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.430" offset="621066">And that practice is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.424" offset="637053">The shipper pays an export rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.037" offset="655548">The carrier agrees by appropriate tariff rule or provision that it will provide the wharfage and handling services itself or that it will absorb the wharfage and handling charges of designated commercial terminal operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.454" offset="741230">The wharfage and handling charges as the tariffs put it are included in the export rate to and from Norfolk, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.114" offset="783862">The carriers however limit the places at which this performance can be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.826" offset="822627">Now, the purpose and effect of this, we think, are fairly evident.</text>

            <text syncTime="744.613" offset="3081801">The Government assumed control and proceeded to give detailed on-the-scene instructions as to how the loading, the unloading, I should say, was to be accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.329" offset="3140733">But it made a contract with Stevenson &amp; Young, this commercial operator, whereby Stevenson &amp; Young continued to do the physical work for the Government just as it does the physical work on the commercial freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.151" offset="3203950">The Government took over its entire supervisory force, its entire labor force.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.712" offset="3226206">It hired it by a contract and the general manager of Stevenson &amp; Young got his instructions from the Army personnel at the piers and handled the freight accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.910" offset="3346996">Now, as I have indicated in answer to questions earlier, the carriers had continued during this post 1951 period to pay $1 on each ton of commercial freight which is handled by the pier operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.018" offset="3443440">The Government has hired Stevenson &amp; Young to do similar work.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.334" offset="3464756">Actually, the Government's demands are far greater than those with the ordinary shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.842" offset="3494745">It has asked a great deal, more detailed work from the terminal operators, asked him to sort out cargo as it comes in to keep inventory, detailed inventory records so that the Army can lay it's finger on any piece of equipment at any time to keep various records.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.635" offset="3585964">The consequences then that the Government has been paying Stevenson &amp; Young for its services, some $2.87 a ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.772" offset="3630477">We're not claiming that.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.347" offset="3640717">What we are claiming is simply that we are entitled to the same dollar or dollar's worth of service as the commercial shipper receives when he pays the same overall rate that we pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.664" offset="3706023">I think I can perhaps sharply illustrate what we think is the unjustified discrimination here by an illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.976" offset="3743326">The commercial shipper sends a ton of lead pipes from Columbus, Ohio to Norfolk.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.652" offset="3769971">He pays, we'll say, a $10 export rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.527" offset="3785435">The Army does the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.090" offset="3791705">It pays the $10 export rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.566" offset="3805602">Thereafter, the commercial freight goes on, one freight car with the Army pipes on another freight car and back up the same engine.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.280" offset="3848443">The engine gets to Norfolk, it switched to the base piers.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.710" offset="3870177">At that point, Stevenson &amp; Young takes over the commercial ton of pipes acting as agent for the carriers under a contract which they have with the carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.993" offset="3915316">They unload it from the cars and they put it on the pier floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.766" offset="3934438">They do the same thing for the Army under its instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.414" offset="3957008">They unload the Army's ton of pipe and they put it on the pier floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.479" offset="3973308">They probably or very likely handle the two loads of pipe with the same crew of men.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.486" offset="3997341">They put them down on the pier floor perhaps alongside of one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.721" offset="4014268">They're then both picked up by the same boat and carried overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.352" offset="4040808">Now, on the commercial ton of pipes, the carrier pays Stevenson &amp; Young a dollar, $1 a ton for wharfage and handling.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.910" offset="4086993">The military freight, the carriers had refused to pay $1 or any sum whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.642" offset="4113951">Thus from the standpoint of the carriers, the carriers received $9, $10 minus the one for wharfage and handling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.777" offset="4150523">They received $9 -- they realized $9 that is for the line-haul carriage of a ton of commercial freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.259" offset="4188453">Now, the Army's freight, they retained a $10 undiminished by any sum, so they retained $10 for the line-haul carriage of a ton of military freight identical in character between identical points.</text>

            <text syncTime="1128.466" offset="4617279">They can decide which pier operators will be favored by designation and which ones won't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.597" offset="4641729">They can keep people out into the marine terminal business very effectively by not designating them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.936" offset="4663150">That's going to make for discrimination and it's going to demoralize competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.496" offset="4685406">The Commission found that the evils which the parties were complaining about had not yet appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.779" offset="4718529">They appeared on the contrary that the -- that everybody was getting adequate service and it refused the request made to it at that time that the carriers be required to state and assess separate charges for wharfage and handling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.150" offset="4779969">Commissioner Eastman and four other commissioners very vehemently dissented at that time and they predicted the discrimination a result that there would be no healthy competition in the marine terminal business and that it also would make for much more simplified freight regulation, freight regulation as they were required to state the charges separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.126" offset="4867845">But that view did not prevail and so the tie-in arrangement continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.135" offset="4883937">Now, the railroad interest in that tie-in arrangement is perfectly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.682" offset="4902118">They can restrict the entry of competition into the marine terminal business, a business in which they themselves are very frequently engaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.588" offset="4941720">Also, they can limit the number of piers which they will have to serve and that is an operating convenience if that was mixed for savings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.998" offset="4983411">They don't have to send their engines and their operating crews to a larger number of -- of locations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.010" offset="5011414">So they have a clear interest in restricting the port practices as they described.</text>

            <text syncTime="1248.351" offset="5096782">Now, the reason that they're low, as I think, to make allowance or adjustment to the Army when they found it necessary in public interest to run its port of embarkation and work on, I think they're apprehensive that they might be required to do the same for other private shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.454" offset="5193226">Now, whether as an initial matter, restricting the port practices by this tie-in arrangement is a good thing, is not a question which the Court has to decide, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.809" offset="5242650">There maybe justifications for such a restriction and the Commissioner said that there are, which don't apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.917" offset="5283088">Now, the Commission has said in a number of decisions that it's reasonable for the carriers to restrict the availability of this absorption to designated public terminals if those public terminals are adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.613" offset="5357798">And it is said this serves a salutary purpose because it would be wasteful and uneconomical that the carriers were required to disperse their traffic to any and all piers at a port.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.527" offset="5421432">Here, they can keep the traffic concentrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.624" offset="5441912">We don't think that those reasons apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.703" offset="5458213">In the first place, we don't think that the service can be deemed adequate because while there are adequate facilities at the port other than the Army base piers which the Army could use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.822" offset="5510666">The exigencies are such that the Army must perform this kind of operation at a pier where its personnel are present and in control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.168" offset="5552044">Now, I'm not asking the Court to go into an evidentiary matter there because I think the Commission's findings support fully what I've just said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.085" offset="5591751">At record 11, in the paragraph that appears in the middle of this page, Your Honors will find a statement that the Army, from actual experience, has determined that ports of embarkation must be operated by personnel of the military service and employees of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.388" offset="5680880">And then, the Commission goes on to speak about the necessary training to do the planning which precedes the actual loading of the vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.794" offset="5722572">The Commission tells us that precise overseas requirements demand absolute control over all shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.706" offset="5754232">Security of materials must be assured and then it goes on to describe how the base has been organized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.586" offset="5785684">And further on page 20, I will pause to do more than mention that in passing, the Commission states again, at the middle of the page after the citing areas, facts about the Army operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.402" offset="5864991">These indicate to some extent the vast problem of the Army in coordinating the supplies received in the various course for shipment to its widespread forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.300" offset="5912534">And so, I think we have here a case in which on the Commission's own findings, the Army have to operate in a way that it did and hence, realistically, there was no adequate service.</text>

            <text syncTime="1576.547" offset="6409592">And this is a -- a provision out the Pennsylvania tariff which the Commission states to be typical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.775" offset="6442506">And then it starts out by stating certain exceptions which aren't pertinent here, then it goes on to say that, “Wharfage and handling charges,” I'm reading from that at the third line, “Wharfage and handling charges published in a certain tariff will be included in the freight rate to or from Norfolk, subject,” and I'm not dropping to the end of that paragraph, “subject to the following conditions”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.585" offset="6561729">Now, under (b), one of the conditions is that the terminal operator is operating on war properties which are a public terminal facility of the rail carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.701" offset="6642186">And then, under (c), you will note that another condition is that the shipper does not get the benefit of the absorption unless the terminal operator is performing -- it's furnishing the wharfage facilities and performing the handling services for account of and as agent for the rail carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.125" offset="6731839">Then, the carriers say, “When Stevenson &amp; Young is handling commercial freight under our contract that was Stevenson &amp; Young, he's acting for our account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.917" offset="6779068">And therefore, the commercial shipment meets the requirement of the tariff.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1907.785" offset="7734523">And that the Army did not wish to use the railroad's pier facilities by which they mean incidentally, the Army base facilities leased to the commercial terminal operator, thus, effectively preventing the railroads from providing the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.683" offset="7798053">In other words, they say the railroads don't undertake to provide service at a shipper's pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.849" offset="7822817">They don't have to work under supervision of a shipper if they don't want.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.137" offset="7839953">And when the Army, because of necessity or otherwise, chose to repossess its pier, it lost its right to get then to any absorption.</text>

            <text syncTime="2053.871" offset="8318830">Now, the carriers go on to say after stating that Army operation was necessary and that the railroads did not have to perform at the Army's pier, the Commission reasons, and I think this is the core of their case, and I'm still reading from the bottom of 33, “Under such circumstances, there is no obligation upon the railroads to make allowance for unloading and wharfage for.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.626" offset="8441919">And they quote this Court, and they -- they quote from the Atchison, Topeka, and Sta. Fe case, “For whatever transportation service, the law requires the carriers to furnish -- to supply,” excuse me, “they have the right to furnish”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.415" offset="8496985">Now, we think their -- the whole fallacy of their case is in that sentence because this is not a transportation service that the carriers are obliged to supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.942" offset="8543169">They have reached out and gone into a business which is not railroad, as the Commission at other points in its brief states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.748" offset="8582353">They have really preempted a related business, the marine terminal operation business, and they've done it by this device of having an overall charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.535" offset="8625507">Now, they were upheld in that in 1929 by the Commission which said, “We don't think anybody is being hurt by having this tie-in arrangement because everybody is getting adequate service."</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.405" offset="8672946">Now, it's carried a step further, as we view it, because now we're being told in effect, even though you cannot use what service would be made available to you by the carrier, even though the railroads are unwilling and unprepared to give the particular kind of need which you have, you still must pay the overall charge and get benefit of no adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.027" offset="8791437">Now, as we view the Atchison, Topeka and Sta. Fe case, it holds precisely the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.137" offset="8819963">The first issue in that case, which this Court unanimously decided, involved the matter of providing refrigerated cars for shipper's use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.736" offset="8878268">This Court held that the Hepburn Act imposed a specific duty on carriers to provide refrigerated cars for shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.830" offset="8926647">And it said that that being so, the carriers having made immense investments in order to be in a position to provide these refrigerated cars must have an exclusive right to furnish them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.437" offset="8985161">The carriers can't be told by particular shippers that we won't use your refrigerated cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.644" offset="9005955">We'll supply our own refrigeration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.362" offset="9016822">The Court said that that would be obviously unfair and as much as the carrier has to be standing by or ready to provide the services, it should not be made to depend upon haphazard calls for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.106" offset="9071783">Then, this Court went on, however, and it considered the matter providing the so-called accessorial services which aren't within the transportation obligation, services which are sometimes performed by shippers, which are sometimes performed by carriers, which are sometimes performed by third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.476" offset="9165302">And the Court said, “Now, in that situation, it must be determined on the fact of each particular case who may better perform the job and the public interest should be considered.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.134" offset="9211904">And then, the Court went on to state what the consequence of that determination would be, and we've quoted a paragraph which has crucial bearing, I think, on this case, the paragraph from the Atchison opinion at page 14 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.754" offset="9286405">I'll read those two sentences, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.642" offset="9297899">“Neither party has a right to insist upon a wasteful or expensive service for which the consumer must ultimately pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.011" offset="9335411">The interest of the public is to be considered as well as that of shippers and carriers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.170" offset="9356100">Then, I would ask Your Honors to mark these words particularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.533" offset="9369475">“Their rights," that is the right to shippers and carriers, "in turn having been adjusted by a reduction in the rate, if the loading is done in whole or in part by the shipper and by an increase in the rate where the loading is done in whole or in part by the carrier, but -- by whom so ever done, the loading must be such as to fit the freight for shipment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.044" offset="9479502">Now, the only way we can fit this freight for shipment at the Army base piers is to have the personnel on the piers to give the on-the-scene directions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.926" offset="9515029">The only way we can fit the freight for shipment is by being in control of those piers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.275" offset="9540524">The carriers say they are unwilling to work for the Army when it is in control of the pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.263" offset="9564453">When these piers were repossessed, they were asked if they would undertake not to provide handling under our direction with -- with the Government giving detailed specifications as to what it wanted done and they refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.613" offset="9629863">They said, “No, we don't work at shippers' piers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.338" offset="9644701">So, the Army then went ahead and actually proceeded to use for its labor the very same people whom the carriers used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.305" offset="9680541">And we've been told contrary, we think, to the teaching in the Atchison case that there is to be no adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.742" offset="9714291">We are of the view that since it was necessary for the Government to operate the piers under the Commission's own findings that the carriers in that circumstance at least are obliged to untie the package which they've tied together, that they're obliged to make the same $1 adjustment in the case of the military freight as they do in the case of the commercial freight.</text>

            <text syncTime="3096.296" offset="12488600">As you've been told, it's the general rule in the United States that shippers are required to load and consignees are required to unload carload freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.082" offset="12531649">However, it has also been held by the Commission and by this Court that without any change in their line-haul rates, railroads may assume an obligation to provide loading services under their tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.811" offset="12590582">Of course, if they do so, all the shippers in the same circumstances must be treated alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.980" offset="12619316">Export freight as distinguished from domestic freight requires the use of ports or piers upon which freight can be moved and up -- and to which the freight can be unloaded within reach of ships tackle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.806" offset="12682637">Railroads have no legal duty to -- to provide such wharfage and unloading services for export freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.735" offset="12718268">But for many years, they have customarily provided such services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.311" offset="12748570">These services may, as they are in -- in some parts of the United States, they may be stated separately as -- as separate charges apart from the line-haul rate, or they may be furnished without any additional stated charge in addition to the line-haul rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.337" offset="12828714">In getting to this case, the railroads which serve the North Atlantic ports, that's from Hampton Roads including Norfolk North, have, for some years, preceding 1929, I couldn't give an exact date, followed the practice of providing such wharfage and handling services on export freight without establishing or collecting a separate charge in addition to the line-haul rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.485" offset="12949295">This practice grew out an extensive background or I should almost say a delicate background of competition not only between carriers and between ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.676" offset="12990046">That history is and much of the justification is set forth at some length in a report to the Commission entitled “Wharfage Charges at Atlantic and Gulf Ports” in 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.690" offset="13054098">Now, railroads provide such -- often provide such wharfage and handling services on their own piers with their own personnel, or where they do not own such piers, they will contract with commercial terminal operators or with municipally owned pier operators and to provide such services as agents for the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.486" offset="13161305">The railroads have served the North Atlantic ports, including Norfolk, which is involved here, have never undertaken to provide such services on all of the export freight as the tariffs in the record on this case show.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.533" offset="13225462">They have for reasons almost of this on their face, not provided such services for specified types of cargo for grain, bulk liquids and tankers, whether they don't provide it unless the inbound freight rate is equal to a certain amount, in the case of the tariffs in this case, unless it's at least 19 cents a hundred pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.824" offset="13314696">And moreover, the North Atlantic -- the carrier serving the North Atlantic ports do not provide such services on export freight delivered to the private pier of the shipper or consignee, unless, as Mr. Spritzer has pointed out, the tariff involved in this case specifically provides that the railroads will furnish wharfage and handling services only on export freight which is delivered to the vessel by rail or for both properties owned or leased by Stevenson &amp; Young and operated by that company as a public terminal facilities of railroads and only when Stevenson &amp; Young performs such services as agent for the railroads.</text>

            <text syncTime="3419.959" offset="13783228">I should emphasize that this dollar a ton was the actual complete payment to Stevenson &amp; Young for these services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.358" offset="13812799">It was not just an allowance toward the cost of the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.600" offset="13825755">It was the complete payment for the services and the shipper was not billed for anything additional or separately for those services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.799" offset="13870582">And during this period, prior to May 1, 1951, the railroads paid this $1 a ton for wharfage and handling to the Stevenson &amp; Young on both commercial export freight and upon the Army's military export freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.123" offset="13955845">On May 1, 1951, the Government took possession of its piers, except that what the Commission described and it's not challenged, at least I don't think it is, a very limited portion of the facilities was made available, left available to Stevenson &amp; Young where it continued to handle commercial freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.169" offset="14060022">And on this portion of the facilities which was thus left available to Stevenson &amp; Young for handling commercial freight, Stevenson &amp; Young continued to act as agents for the carriers and performed -- continued to perform this wharfage and handling service on commercial export shipments for a $1 a ton.</text>

            <text syncTime="3637.747" offset="14654360">Secondly, that no military traffic was stored on or handled over any form of property under a lease or permit to Stevenson &amp; Young for commercial traffic at any time during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.619" offset="14709844">But rather, all such export military traffic after delivery to the base was in the possession of and under the exclusive control of the Army.</text>

            <text syncTime="5216.476" offset="20969305">And that was obviously the -- the apprehension of the carriers down the Norfolk area when they were asked for this back in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.133" offset="20995950">They were afraid that it would spread.</text>
            <text syncTime="5226.880" offset="21010892">And -- and the Commission agreed to them because the Commission -- the -- the Commission held in this case that for the -- that for the carriers to make such an allowance to the Government as a shipper, while not making such an allowance to private shippers in the same circumstances, would be a -- would be a discrimination, a deviation from -- from tariffs in violation of Section 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="5251.412" offset="21109008">The Commission relied heavily in what we think is the persuasive analogy of the switching cases as decided by the Commission and with the approval of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5264.132" offset="21159894">In brief, in those cases, it was pointed out that the line-haul rates generally include delivery to shippers and delivery, among other things, usually includes delivery at the unloading point on a shipper's spur per switch.</text>
            <text syncTime="5284.051" offset="21239620">But in the case of large industrial shippers, the Commission found where there are many loading and unloading points within -- within the -- the limits of the shipper's plant, the Commission held, and this Court sustained its decision, that this duty to deliver under the line-haul rates did not include delivery beyond and -- beyond an uninterrupted movement at the carrier's convenience which usually meant that the line-haul obligation seized to interchange tracks at the -- at the beginning of the plant limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="5322.532" offset="21393533">The principle of those cases was that if a shipper's convenience is interposed to prevent terminal services at the carrier's convenience, then the carrier is relieved of obligation even to perform a service or to make an allowance to the shipper for doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5341.382" offset="21468871">And -- and we think that that principle long applied by the Commission and by the -- by the courts applies here.</text>

            <text syncTime="5382.092" offset="21631770">I say big shippers because only big shippers, who have lots of traffic to dispose of, operate pier -- operate private piers.</text>

            <label>Mr. Windsor F. Cousins</label>
            <text syncTime="5559.441" offset="22341151">If it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5563.986" offset="22359333">This case, including the other Norfolk case, had been decided four times by the full Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5571.038" offset="22387545">Its decisions were in line with 12 or 15 other opinions of the Commission over the past four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5580.546" offset="22425579">The principles that the Commission has established are strictly in accord with the rules laid down by this Court in the famous allowance cases such as the old Arbuckle Case, U.S. versus B. &amp; O., 231 U.S. 274.</text>
            <text syncTime="5598.708" offset="22498200">Now, not only has the Commission held that it is not discriminatory to do what we do, but the Commission has held again and again that if we did for any private shipper such as Standard Oil, who has a pier at Norfolk, Swift, Army, only the biggest industries who can afford to track -- track vessel, if we did for anyone of them what the Government asks us to do here, we'd be guilty of a rebate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5631.034" offset="22627558">So the Justice Department, instead of standing up for principles of regulation that have been established by the courts and by the Commission is attempting here for the sake of winning a money judgment to throw out of the window every rule that we know about and have kept strictly in action during the past four years to avoid rebates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5661.181" offset="22748139">Now, let me simplify this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5663.298" offset="22756603">To answer Justice Black, although, I don't want to begin at this point, no shipper pays more than any other shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="5669.394" offset="22780949">No shipper pays for service he doesn't get, including the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="5674.468" offset="22801220">We don't -- we don't charge anybody for providing piers and unloading their freight if we don't render the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5682.822" offset="22834657">Now, there is a great excess of pier facilities in Norfolk, probably 10 times more than can be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="5691.493" offset="22869347">Four railroads own their own pier facilities, an operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="5696.228" offset="22888260">Those piers are adequate to handle all the traffic that goes through Norfolk including the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="5704.147" offset="22919920">One of those railroads, the Chesapeake and Ohio also serves this so-called Army base, publishes the same export rates that the other railroads published but does not undertake to absorb any wharfage or handling charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="5723.741" offset="22998288">It never has and the Commission held in 1929 that it didn't have to because there is nothing in the export rates, the line-haul rates that requires this service to be rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="5738.421" offset="23057011">Therefore, the Commission has required one railroad to publish the same rates to the same terminal but not to render the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="5748.437" offset="23097135">Now, prior to 1951, this public wharfinger was in charge of the facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="5754.925" offset="23123048">He was an agent of the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="5758.045" offset="23135587">We didn't just agree in a tariff for some place to pay him so much for doing something.</text>
            <text syncTime="5763.477" offset="23157321">He was a railroad agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5765.800" offset="23166621">The contract, under which he acts, is in the record, page 479.</text>
            <text syncTime="5772.459" offset="23193161">He agrees to provide pier space for the railroad like their own pier space.</text>
            <text syncTime="5777.682" offset="23214059">This is just a means of supplementing railroad facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5781.749" offset="23230360">Instead of building our own, we rent a facility, and that's what we do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5787.740" offset="23254288">This public wharfinger, who is in the nature of public utility himself, provides us wharfage space.</text>
            <text syncTime="5796.021" offset="23287411">He takes charge of all railroad shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="5798.708" offset="23298173">He keeps custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="5800.252" offset="23304338">He agrees to collect our freight charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="5802.692" offset="23314160">He agrees to be liable to us for the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="5806.518" offset="23329416">He agrees to collect the published railroad storage charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="5810.086" offset="23343731">In certain instance, he retains of -- for his compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5812.968" offset="23355225">In others, he gives them to us, but he acts for the railroads in all respects that the railroad would have to act if it were there itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5823.550" offset="23397543">Now, we pay him compensation, and we can pay him anything we want.</text>
            <text syncTime="5827.952" offset="23415202">The Commission has no control over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5829.998" offset="23423352">The Supreme Court of the United States has no control over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5833.070" offset="23435682">It's solely a matter of bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="5835.942" offset="23447176">We do pay him certain amounts of money that total a dollar.</text>
            <text syncTime="5840.636" offset="23465880">And now, the -- the Government wants us to pay it a dollar although it doesn't purport to access our agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5847.727" offset="23494301">It doesn't purport to do the services that the -- that our agent does for us, but this is what it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="5855.716" offset="23526275">Prior to 1951, when this was a railroad terminal, everybody, including the military, got the same service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5864.866" offset="23562846">And the military shipped over to that terminal as the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="5868.937" offset="23579146">The military today and all through the war has shipped through such a terminal in Philadelphia and has gotten the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5878.112" offset="23615822">But the Government, not the Army, the Federal Maritime Board, dispossessed that public terminal operator in 1951 and split the terminal into three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5889.850" offset="23662738">One part, it leased to the United States Navy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5893.936" offset="23679143">They don't call it a lease, they call it a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5896.682" offset="23690115">The document itself is in the record, whatever it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="5900.575" offset="23705684">One third -- no, not -- I'm not speaking of proportion, but one proportion went to the United States Navy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5907.817" offset="23734627">Whereupon, the United States Navy, from that day to this, has taken delivery of its own shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="5913.849" offset="23758764">It has paid the export rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5915.815" offset="23766601">It has not received nor requested wharfage and handling allowances and does not in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5923.708" offset="23798157">Another portion of the terminal was turned back to this public utility, Stevenson &amp; Young, to continue its operator -- its operation as a public facility and as agent of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="5938.449" offset="23857194">And it remains so until the Army threw it off beginning in 1953, the first day of January 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="5946.999" offset="23891362">Now, what happens since then, nobody knows because the Army has never been able or has been willing to tell the Commission or a court how their case was changed by the cessation of the Stevenson &amp; Young operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5960.639" offset="23945906">But in any event, on that pier operated by Stevenson &amp; Young, as long as it remained in existence, and today, if it so operated, any shipper, including the military, can have his goods exported without paying the published plus charges because we absorb them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5985.865" offset="24046843">Now, we do that for this reason, the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="5989.046" offset="24059591">We offered to supply piers in these ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="5991.904" offset="24070980">It's admitted on all sizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5993.450" offset="24077145">We have no legal obligation to supply piers, but we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5998.462" offset="24097207">So we supply piers, and it happens at Norfolk.</text>
            <text syncTime="6001.050" offset="24107551">We supply more than adequate piers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6003.807" offset="24118627">This record shows that even the Army, when it took over its pier, wasn't used in it to more than one force -- force of its capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6013.095" offset="24155721">There's any amount of excess pier term space down there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6017.418" offset="24173066">Now, what we don't do at Norfolk or any other port is to make a rebate to a shipper who says he does not want, for one reason or other, to ship his goods over the railroad pier but he's going to have his own pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="6037.115" offset="24251852">This record shows who the big pier owners are, not only at Norfolk, but at all in the other ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="6043.604" offset="24277765">There are several exhibits, and they're only the big ones, the Standard Oils, the U.S. Steels, the Armor and Swifts, the ones like that that the Justice Department would be watching more carefully than anybody else in the world if we made a rebate to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6059.611" offset="24341817">There's still a principle of law that says that when a railroad is agreeable to supplying a pier station, which is really a steamship station, it should be supplied by the water carriers rather than the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="6076.812" offset="24410572">But when we are willing for the purpose of attracting traffic to our rails and facilitating them over, when we are willing to supply that, there is no principle that we have to do something similar for the shipper who does not want to ship these goods over our pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="6096.958" offset="24491238">The -- the cases are against that, the case that Mr. Spritzer explained, the Atchison case is against that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6103.543" offset="24517569">That's the case that says, “Whatever service or facility, a railroad has the duty to supply, it has the right to supply.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6113.479" offset="24557275">And just in passing, so that I don't forget it, let me say that Mr. Spritzer today attempts to distinguish the Atchison case on the ground that it dealt with transportation service whereas this is accessorial service.</text>
            <text syncTime="6132.201" offset="24632195">In the District Court below in this case, the Justice Department argued that this was transportation service, not accessorial service.</text>
            <text syncTime="6140.834" offset="24666676">It's reversed its position completely.</text>

            <text syncTime="6396.872" offset="25690885">And here's why we do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="6436.763" offset="25850441">But nevertheless, the rates apply only to shipments, which moved from the railroad to the vessel without possession being lost to the shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="6449.834" offset="25902686">Now, at the port on our piers, somebody has to make the interchange from the car to the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="6459.594" offset="25941765">We cannot permit the shipper to come on the piers and do it for himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6463.703" offset="25958170">We have never thought that was feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="6467.187" offset="25972172">For one thing, the shipper isn't at the port very often, so it has -- the burden has been divided off between the railroad and the water carrier that we unload from the floor of the -- from the car to the floor of the pier and the vessel picks it up from there and puts it in, in the ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="6486.105" offset="26047822">Now, the Army doesn't want that service for this reason, and here is the distinguishing characteristic that prevents a finding of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="6498.179" offset="26096097">Army shipments are not consigned, like these commercial export shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="6504.283" offset="26120547">They are not consigned to the steamship company or to a shipper's agent.</text>

            <text syncTime="6522.043" offset="26191496">The railroad never sees the ship that takes these goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="6525.277" offset="26204453">They are delivered to hauled tracks two miles back to the pier where the Army directs the railroad to deliver its shipments.</text>
