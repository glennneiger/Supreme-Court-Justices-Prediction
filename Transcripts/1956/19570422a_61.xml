            <text syncTime="54.797" offset="219115">At an appointed hour, police officers descended upon the home, the business office and the warehouse of appellant and they seized hundreds or thousands of books and pictures, parting them away in two trucks and in a car.</text>

            <text syncTime="1576.636" offset="6306482">Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.252" offset="6324976">I'm sure that as I begin my first address to this addressed tribunal that I share the feelings of all the counsel who have preceded me through the years that this is perhaps the highest achievement that a counsel can reach in practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.450" offset="6373773">I wish I thought more adequate to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.013" offset="6384013">In answering counsel for the appellant, if Your Honor please, I would like first to attempt to clarify the issues as I see them express as best I can in legal language from the jurisdictional statements and the briefs and as best I can together what that counsel has just said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.427" offset="6453708">As I see it, the contention of the appellant is basically that the statute is unconstitutional on its face in any event because it violates the First Amendment, invades and encroaches upon the right of freedom of speech and freedom of the press because it is so vague and indefinite as to constitute a deprivation of property and liberty and a violation of due process of law for the reasons that one cannot tell when he is violating or encroaching on this statute by his conduct and because prosecutors and judges may become censors by arbitrary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.960" offset="6611801">And lastly, that in this particular application, the exclusive postal power of the Federal Government has been encroached upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.189" offset="6652656">That last point in my opinion was due respect to appellants' counsel, and so totally without merit that I'm not going to spend anytime on it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.323" offset="6689228">I would like to call Your Honors attention to the fact that the statute involved here has in its introductory sentence something quite important on several of the issues involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.172" offset="6748682">It commences with the words every person who willfully and lewdly either rights, keeps for sale, advertises and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.220" offset="6788807">Now, those words "willfully" and "lewdly" are not always present in such statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.711" offset="6806779">And they, of course, post a degree of safeguard for the defendant under due process as well as it's exemplified in the same Wepplo case that we have mentioned in which counsel and I differ as to whether the construction of the statute on the definition is pure dictum as I contended it is because the case was reversed on this very word "lewdly" and that that defendant in Wepplo was asked by his counsel if he did whatever he was trying to do lewdly and an objection was sustained to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.993" offset="6915971">And the case was reversed because of the fact that the statute said "lewdly" and the defendant should be allowed to testify that he didn't presumably as he was going to that he didn't do it lewdly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.711" offset="6954841">Now, the Court, before coming to that point, does use the phrase that counsel mentioned and to that extent as -- as dictum, as an expression of opinion by the Court, becomes of some interest, although, I don't think it binds anybody because it is pure dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.164" offset="7012624">And also, I think we should bear in mind while I'm speaking of that that it went as far as it needed to for the facts in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.333" offset="7041254">Now, in that same connection, I want to call the Court's attention to the fact that it's been mentioned that that is that the defendant or the appellant here, who could have had a jury under California law if he had chosen, chose to waive it in the manner was tried by a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.047" offset="7088170">Therefore, there was not at any stage of this proceeding and instruction defining the word obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.967" offset="7107814">And it is our contention that it -- that under the presumption of constitutionality and the presumption of regularity in the lower courts that the trial judge is presumed here and in all the intermediate courts after the conviction to have correctly and accurately and constitutionally define the word obscene if it's possible so to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.312" offset="7189211">I mentioned that because nowhere here do we have an instruction which pins us down to a particular definition that no court in California, as a matter of fact, has given a definition other than as dictum in the Wepplo case as I have described.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.528" offset="7242083">Now, I don't want to be misunderstood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.769" offset="7246994">I feel that our exhibits in this case, very definitely, do meet that test, although, I think we also go further and into a definition, which is perfectly proper under all these circumstances of the word obscene even though it was necessary in the Wepplo case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2018.314" offset="8073195">Now, of course, in his closing brief and in his oral argument, he contends otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.673" offset="8090645">Now, in that particular regard without standing here and quoting from some of these exhibits as I would hate to do, I want to call Your Honors attention first to the fact that in this record there is something that is very unusual, which appellant asked to be made part of the record and I'm glad that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.133" offset="8152503">And that is an analysis that was prepared by our office of the exhibits originally for our own use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.784" offset="8175073">When the Appellate Department of the Superior Court, Los Angeles County, some in our oral argument using this, they asked for copies and it was stipulated they might have them and it's become part of this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.168" offset="8212584">That suggests which particular exhibits and which pages we consider the most obscene and I feel what was on that basis, you'll find the decision was made by the Appellate Department of the Superior Court and they do not doubt that some of the books were obscene.</text>

            <text syncTime="2715.453" offset="10861714">It seemed concern entirely with people who like these items and who sent for them and who are erotically aroused by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.125" offset="10888464">I want to submit to this Court that I have set forth in my brief six classes of people that I don't think are ever any moral danger of being aroused by these things but whose disgust and reaction of this pleasure is something entitled of protection of the State under the police power that this in considering the -- the social value of these materials compared briefs to free speech, this short -- Court should consider these classes of people who do not like these things, who are disgusted by them and in the case of little children who are terrified by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.906" offset="11007582">As we mentioned in our brief, it's a common experience with every prosecutor whoever prosecuted criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.152" offset="11028584">That one little girl there are shown of obscene pictures by sex criminals are the preliminary step to their crime and it happens literally every week in the courts, the invariable reactions of that child is far from being erotic or being any danger to make her immoral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.682" offset="11086681">She is simply terrified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.307" offset="11093159">And we'll submit that under those circumstances, those class of people should be considered by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2793.615" offset="11174452">Counsel is worried about people who had good motives suffering under the statute at California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.170" offset="11224607">A reading of the statute that counsel has referred to it, every person who willfully and lewdly, either rights opposes, stereotype and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.497" offset="11269956">Under that statute, no person exhibiting the statue of Hallebardier or Venus de Milo or any pictures of the classical nature exhibiting nude figures put under any circumstances to be affected by this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.897" offset="11359504">Counsel didn't mention -- hasn't mentioned yet but probably will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.983" offset="11375909">The Chaucer's Canterbury Tales could be prescribed by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.431" offset="11397642">I don't know how anyone who take in addition ancient or modern of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and exhibit them lewdly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.716" offset="11442782">It's just -- those are the things that -- that don't happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.622" offset="11458456">And they don't happen under the California statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.779" offset="11471099">The Wepplo case has been referred too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.775" offset="11487086">The case went off on the point that the Court had refused to instruct the jury properly on the question of whether these matters were exhibited lewdly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.675" offset="11538599">Then, in dicta, the Court gave a good definition of what the Court thought would -- would answer the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.022" offset="11576007">You must consider the whole book and its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.665" offset="11590635">Otherwise, you have nothing to worry about in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.431" offset="11617698">I think -- probably, the question of definiteness and indefiniteness will come up later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.335" offset="11653329">Before I come to that, the counsel -- there were questions asked about the evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.314" offset="11681228">There was no objection raised in the lower court or here that the evidence is insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.164" offset="11712575">No question of that kind at all, the question briefed and submitted, not with the chandler that was exhibited in the New York case and Wepplo whether this statute such a standard by which a defendant do not know how to protect himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.535" offset="11790106">That's all there is in the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.761" offset="11811004">And also whether the First Amendment prohibit all interference with speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.596" offset="11850292">Now, that question has been answered in the Chaplinsky case and the quotation in a complete answer to -- of that proposition allowing the broadest scope for the language and purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.636" offset="11922495">It is well understood that the writers' free speech is not absolute at all times on and under all circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.598" offset="11954364">There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any constitutional problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.880" offset="11999504">These include the lewd and obscene, the profane and libels and the insulting or fighting words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.743" offset="12038896">Those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to insight an immediate breach of the peace is that well observed that such utterances, and here is the essential part of that quotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.329" offset="12097306">Those utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas or of such slights social value as a step to truth but any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly out waived by the social interest in order and morality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.116" offset="12184451">A complete answer by the late Mr. Justice Murphy to the argument as of May -- as to the First Amendment is included in the Fourteenth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.871" offset="12227396">And then, we come to the question of definiteness and that matter was to dispose of by Honorable Judge Frankfurter in this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.532" offset="12270028">In these matters, legislatures are confronted with a dilemma.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.969" offset="12295837">If a law is framed with narrow particularity, too easy opportunities are afforded to nullify the purposes of the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.418" offset="12333662">What risks do the innocent run, a draft of paragraph, of being caught in a net not designed for them?</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.723" offset="12366890">How important is the policy of the legislation so that those who really like to pursue innocent conduct are not likely to be caught unaware?</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.354" offset="12409313">How easy is it to be explicitly particular?</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.916" offset="12423628">How necessary is it to read a somewhat penumbral margin but sufficiently reveal by what is condemned to those who do not want to sail close to the shore of questionable conduct?</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.058" offset="12480157">These are light questions confront legislative press.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.761" offset="12498965">Answers to these questions are not to be found in any legislative manual or in the work of great legislative craftsman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.005" offset="12528013">They are not to be found in the opinions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.148" offset="12540552">They are questions of judgment but purely within the responsibility and the competence of legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.792" offset="12571167">The discharge of that responsibility should not be set if not by abstract notions about indefiniteness.</text>
