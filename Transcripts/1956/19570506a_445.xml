            <text syncTime="19.155" offset="180015">This is an admiralty proceeding for exoneration from or limitation of liability in a collision case in which the petitioner in this Court was the petitioner for exoneration from or limitation of liability in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.004" offset="259427">In brief, the facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.830" offset="266742">The petitioner owned a tug and a barge which were proceeding up the Hudson River in the middle of the night when a small pleasure craft on which there were 11 people proceeding in the opposite direction, south in the Hudson River, collided with the barge, capsized, sank and was a total loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.608" offset="361827">And the 10 of the passengers on that little boat survived, but one lost his life, the respondent's husband lost his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.205" offset="408221">I should say to you that the tug and the barge were made up in push-tow fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.830" offset="430686">That is to say, there is in the stern of the barge of the -- in which the tug puts its bow and the barge is securely lashed to the tug so that the tug has utter and complete control over the barge in every respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.211" offset="492231">Following this collision and the loss of the little boat called Blackstone, five actions at law were begun in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.700" offset="538206">One to recover for the death of the respondent's husband, and another, to recover for personal injuries and the loss of the Blackstone.</text>

            <text syncTime="206.383" offset="928893">There have been six other persons who had then spilled into the water and were rescued still to be heard from.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.305" offset="964629">This petitioner filed its petition for limitation of -- or in the first instance exoneration from liability because the claims vastly exceeded the values involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.710" offset="1014262">As I have said to you, the claims are for the five amounted to more than $650,000, and yet the value of the tug was $110,000, the barge $165,000, and the freight money, $8500.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.326" offset="1072671">The aggregate of the petitioners interest therefore in his -- its vessels were $283,500.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.580" offset="1101720">Accordingly, we filed the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.359" offset="1112795">It's appearing that there would be need to distribute a limited fund if liability should be decreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.613" offset="1141844">A bond was given only for the tug at that time for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.813" offset="1170578">It is well settled by the decisions of this Court that where a barge is solely in control of a tug, she is not liable and her value does not have to be included in the limitation fund unless she'd be guilty of some individual fault in rem of her own, and there was at that time no claim that she was.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.478" offset="1269321">This respondent accepted to our petition on the ground that we had not given adequate security and claimed on that occasion that the barge was in -- at fault in rem because of not showing of proper lights.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.893" offset="1330970">The judge sustained those exceptions but gave us leave to file an additional bond for the barge which we promptly did and there's no dispute about the amount and there has been almost from the beginning a bond posted in the District Court for the full amount of the value of the two vessels plus the freight money.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.148" offset="1407979">In that proceeding, in that limitation of liability proceeding, this respondent filed her answer in denying our claim to limit liability if liable, and of course, denying that we are entitled to exoneration.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.739" offset="1474330">In that proceeding, however, she filed claim in a substantially reduced amount, namely, for $250,000 instead of $500,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.179" offset="1516126">In that proceeding also, the 10 other passengers filed claims, but in an aggregate of only $9500, I am sorry to trouble you with the figures but they do become important, the arithmetic is of importance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.331" offset="1576730">So that these claims which -- when the petition was filed, aggregate of $657,500 with six more to be heard from were -- when all the claims were filed in the limitation proceeding itself, only $259,500.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.404" offset="1677040">At that stage, this respondent again made a motion in the District Court, this time to vacate the injunction on the ground that the claims could not possibly equal the fund that an inadequate fund was necessary to sustain the proceeding, and therefore, she wanted to have the restraining order vacated as to her and allow her to proceed in the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="429.093" offset="1819773">I misstated, I misspoken myself, in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.509" offset="1833357">That motion came on before Judge Weinfeld and he denied the motion on the ground that it could not yet be said that the fund would necessarily be adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.577" offset="1897723">For this reason, the fund will be made up, assuming that there is liability at all, the fund will be made up of the value of the tug if the tug is at fault, of the barge if the barge is at fault but not of either that is not personally at fault in rem.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.339" offset="1976717">So, my argument was, and Judge Weinfeld agreed with my argument at that time, that you can't say that this fund is bound to be enough until you decide which of these vessels was liable in rem.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.597" offset="2033768">And you can't do that until after trial, and therefore, you should not vacate the restraining order and allow this action at law in the state court to go along by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.787" offset="2086536">The judge agreed with all of that and denied the motion but he added a little caveat at the end of his opinion and he said; however, if this respondent, claimant as she was called in that Court, will reduce her claims so that the amount of the claims against each vessel is less than that vessel's value, then she may proceed in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.106" offset="2203773">Well, with that advice from the judge, the necessary stipulations and so on were filed in the District Court and a new motion was made to vacate the restraining order as to this respondent and that motion was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.947" offset="2275140">The theory then being that there were two funds, two sort of separate proceedings, which the Court of Appeal later said very explicitly, one for the tug and one for the barge.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.348" offset="2336789">This respondent had allocated her $250,000 claim, a $100,000 to the tug, and a $150,000 to the barge.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.530" offset="2377540">So that when you add the $9000 I had claimed for all the other 10, the aggregate of the claims against the tug is less than her value and the aggregate of the claims against the barge is less than the barge's value.</text>

            <text syncTime="762.871" offset="3154840">I'll -- I'll be happy to answer your question right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.440" offset="3169155">The -- the origin of this so-called rule in the Second Circuit, as I have referred to it in my brief, is just such a case, it was the Aquitania.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.935" offset="3215130">The Aquitania sank a small fishing vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.460" offset="3233207">Upwards of two years went by when the lawsuits brought in the state court by the next of kin of the people who lost their lives in that fishing boat were pending and were coming on for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.050" offset="3295587">Then, as they were about to be reached for trial, all in one bunch, the owners of the Cunard Line, the owners of the Aquitania; filed a petition for limitation of liability and represented in their petition that the value of the Aquitania was $9 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.902" offset="3371029">And the claims, as was later demonstrated, because Judge Augustus Hand do have the case, sent it to a commissioner to find out how much the claims were, could not exceed about $300,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.951" offset="3427140">So the -- the petition was attacked of its foundation on the ground that it had not been brought in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.595" offset="3461726">And that was the reason that that petition was treated the way it was, the restraining order was vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.453" offset="3501223">And I -- I'll come to this a little later on in the regular course of my argument, if I may, but answering Your Honors question, the rule for which I would contend in the last analysis in this Court is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.853" offset="3550751">That if at the time the petition is filed, the vessel owner, in good faith, fears -- reasonably fears, if you like, that the claims will exceed the fund, he is entitled to file his petition and the Court cannot be -- and jurisdiction properly attaches at that stage under those conditions and that the Court does not lose its jurisdiction because it later appears that the petitioner was unduly pessimistic.</text>

            <text syncTime="1022.351" offset="4192737">So I have really three points here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.550" offset="4201618">One, that under these circumstances, at least, an inadequate fund is not a prerequisite, an absolute prerequisite to maintaining the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.064" offset="4243623">Secondly, even if it'd be, it cannot yet be said that the fund must be inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.377" offset="4276851">And third, that the state court action must be fruitless in any event hence, it should not be -- we should not be required to proceed in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.424" offset="4321050">Now at the outset, I should like to refer to the statute which is printed completely beginning at page 39 of the -- the petitioner's brief in an appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.478" offset="4369324">And what we concede to be of more important passages of it are printed beginning at page 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.828" offset="4406732">We say at the outset that -- and it's part of the claim that the statute nowhere says that an inadequate fund is necessary to maintaining the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.549" offset="4453543">Section 183 (a) provides that where the owner without privity or knowledge is liable, and his liability shall not exceed the value of his interest in the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.571" offset="4509654">I should add parenthetically that the other provisions of Section 133, after subsection (a), relate to seagoing vessels and a so-called statutory fund of $60 per ton which is not any part of this case because our vessels here were not seagoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.806" offset="4594604">And at Section 184 provides that where the fund is not adequate, either the owner of the vessel or the persons who have suffered loss, may institute the proceeding and Section 185 provides and this is -- was the law when this incident occurred that the vessel owner, within six months after a claimant shall have given to or filed with such owner a written notice of the claim may petition at District Court, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.297" offset="4732531">And the last sentence of that provision is of considerable significance as it seems to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.856" offset="4758758">It provides, upon compliance with the requirements of this section, all claims and proceedings against the owner with respect to the matter in question shall cease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.273" offset="4812466">Now, the Act did not set up any procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.033" offset="4823542">This Act was originally passed in 1851.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.494" offset="4833364">It set up no procedures for invoking its benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.436" offset="4857083">And it was 20 years before this Court had occasion to consider the making of rules, and I'll come in a moment to the decision that caught -- that brought that about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.631" offset="4905880">But the rules are now Rules 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55.51 is the rule of this Court which requires -- which defines what the petitioner in a limitation proceeding must say in his petition, and it does that with considerable particularity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.696" offset="4998144">It's at page 44 of the petitioner's brief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.069" offset="5011623">It shall set forth the facts or state the facts showing that the petition is filed in the proper district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.660" offset="5038059">It must show the amount of all demands including all unsatisfied liens or claims of liens arising on the voyage in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.841" offset="5074735">And what suits, if any, are pending and the value of the vessel, the closer the void that is it asks this pertinent arithmetical questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.584" offset="5117680">How much in the way of claims are you faced with?</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.524" offset="5133458">And on the other hand, what value have you got in your vessel?</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.501" offset="5149341">But nowhere does the rule say that the claims must exceed the value of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.523" offset="5185494">And of -- of great importance to our view, at least, is rule 53 which provides that in these proceedings, the petitioner shall be at liberty to contest his liability as we do in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.061" offset="5251636">Now, going back to Rule 51, it provides that after reciting these various particulars in the petition, the petitioner may give an interim stipulation and then the last part of Rule 51 at page 47 of our brief provides the said court shall also on the application of the petitioner make an order to restrain the further prosecution of all and any suit or suits against the petitioner and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.449" offset="5389145">That is having filed the petition in keeping with the Court's rules about what the petitioner must alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.192" offset="5416103">In having given the bond, the petitioner is entitled to a restraining order until this proceeding has been carried through with conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.219" offset="5452257">That's what we think that means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.392" offset="5464900">And the word is "shall restrain."</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.650" offset="5486007">Now we think that the cases -- cases show -- cases decided by this Court show that concursus on the question of liability is just as much a part of the intention lying behind this proceeding which in a large way is the creature of this Court, is the creature of the rules of this Court as the division of an inadequate fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.353" offset="5600737">The first case that came to this Court was in 1871, 20 years after the statute was passed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1425.518" offset="5805432">I -- I think the proceeding has to be dealt with as a combination of the statute of 1851 and this Court's rules of 1871 and this Court's uniform decisions from 1871 down up to 1936 and the reenactment of this statute in 1936 with the gloss of this Court's decisions upon the statute and without any change particularly in the light of what the Congress was told at that time about the perks of the whole proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.372" offset="5936880">And I'll -- bear with me till I get to it, I'll be there shortly, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.653" offset="5961958">In this Norwich Company against Wright, that was a collision case and the liability had been determined as was the practice for a great many years in a separate proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.470" offset="6005217">Limitation for many, many years was not sought until liability had been determined in some separate proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.300" offset="6036564">There, the court -- this Court said that -- pointed out that the Act didn't say in what court the benefits of the statute should be invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.123" offset="6079822">The Court said that no court was better adopted to do that than the admiralty that the state courts do not have the requisite jurisdiction and that this Court undoubtedly had the power to make all the need for rules and regulations for facilitating the course of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.901" offset="6147009">This Court said that the shipowner need not admit liability but may institute proceedings to determine the liability as with being hit on the one hand and all the payments at one time on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.655" offset="6198000">And having filed its petition or giving -- given security for the fund, the shipowner will be entitled to an order restraining the prosecution of all other suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.651" offset="6233945">And that if an action should be brought in a state court, the shipowner can follow the same procedure and restrain the further prosecution of that suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.737" offset="6266337">That was in 1871.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.534" offset="6273546">The opinion was written by Mr. Justice Bradley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.797" offset="6282533">I mentioned that because he wrote at least two or three letters delineating the purpose of the Court in the making of these rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.329" offset="6324642">The making of the rules was referred to in -- in that opinion and the rules were handed down at the same term of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.575" offset="6349720">So that, I think that Norwich Company case has a great deal of meaning in the interpretation of the rules himself showing their purpose, the purpose of this Court in making these rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="1572.700" offset="6394128">Well he announced that it would be.</text>

            <text syncTime="1577.807" offset="6414608">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.441" offset="6425161">And the next case, I think, was the benefactor also written by Mr. Justice Bradley in 1880 where he said, concerning the purpose of the rule, the 56th Rule and it was then the 56th Rule has become now the 53rd Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.740" offset="6490363">It was merely intended to relieve the shipowners from the English rule of practice which requires them when they seek the benefit of the law of limited liability to confess the ship to have been enfold in the collision, to require the owners of either vessel to confess fault before allowing them to -- to claim the benefit of the law would go far to deprive them of this benefit altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.734" offset="6578343">Hence, this Court in preparing the rules of procedure for our limitation of liability, deemed it proper to allow a party seeking such limitation to contest any liability, whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.577" offset="6621706">So that the purpose of this Court in setting up this form of procedure to allow the vessel owner to contest his liability in one proceeding with all the claimants against him, however few, or however many is perfectly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.660" offset="6685968">Again, in -- and this is one of the most significant cases in the books on this subject, Providence against -- and New York Steamship Company against Hill, decided in 1883 by this Court, was really a contest between the state courts in Massachusetts and the federal courts to see who was really going to win out and decide these cases for all the time to come.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.968" offset="6779277">Mr. Justice Bradley wrote the opinion in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.138" offset="6791920">There, a ship had burned alongside a dock in New York and consumed some cargo owned by the Hill Company which was a Massachusetts concern, they sued the shipowner in Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.310" offset="6840613">The shipowner filed his limitation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.177" offset="6864123">He sought exoneration under the fire statute and limitation of liability if he should be held in the federal court in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.283" offset="6900485">The Massachusetts court was told about dependency of the limits -- limited liability proceeding and the restraining order had issued and the restraining order was properly served and all that, but the Massachusetts court went right ahead and carried that case through the conclusion and entered judgment against the Steamship Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.331" offset="6976658">Then on appeal that came to this Court, and this Court said -- Mr. Justice Bradley said, before the Court, many significant things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.627" offset="7013857">One of the most significant to our way of thinking is that the statue must not be administered with a type of grudging hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.239" offset="7040293">It must be -- and this Court has said this in a dozen cases and which we referred to in our brief, the statute must be construed liberally to accomplish the intention behind it, the statute and the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.491" offset="7097344">The limit -- the limitation of liability theory was only sketched and outlined by the Act, and the regulation of details as to the form and modes of proceeding was left to be described by judicial authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.558" offset="7145618">Then the Court reviewed the rules and mentioned again the purpose to allow the shipowner to contest his liability in one proceeding against all the claimants at one time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.810" offset="7194624">They referred to the basis, the power of this Court had to make rules as to process actions and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.541" offset="7221582">And said again that the rules were the deliberate judgment of this Court as to the proper mode of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.040" offset="7247496">And the -- the opinion goes on to say for the purposes of having their rights under the Act declared and settled by the definitive decree of a competent court which should be binding on all parties interested and protect the shipowners from being harassed by litigation in other tribunals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.217" offset="7324191">I won't read anymore extracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.037" offset="7335476">There are many if -- if -- when the Court comes to read these -- all decisions of this Court, I am sure you would see that this -- this thread of purpose to bring all these people into concourse, not only for the purpose of distributing an inadequate fund, but also for the purpose of determining in one proceeding what the liability shall be is a very real and basic purpose behind the promulgation of these rules in the first place it has been ever since.</text>

            <text syncTime="1934.168" offset="7840057">And the same thing is true in Spencer Kellogg against Hicks where the opinion of this Court was written by Mr. Justice Roberts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.155" offset="7872031">Now, in 1936, two years after the Morro Castle burned, the Congress had this question before it again and considered the whole thing and only made one substantial change in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.109" offset="7947786">For seagoing ships, it required the shipowner where the fund was not large enough itself to make up an amount equal to $60 per ton of the ship -- of the ship's tonnage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.395" offset="8004942">That doesn't apply to this kind of a situation because these vessels were not seagoing vessels and that $60 ton fund was limited to seagoing vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.192" offset="8040155">It also made another significant change, namely, it required the petitioner to institute his proceeding within six months at the time he receives his first written notice of claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.483" offset="8089266">That has not been the law before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.733" offset="8098356">Prior to that time, the petitioner, the vessel owner could start its petition that anytime, that even after he had tried the case on the merits and -- and lost it in appeal two or three times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.705" offset="8146213">Now, when Congress was considering that the whole thing, as it did at great length at that time, it had some of the most eminent members of the admiralty bar and had that testimony on hearings, and as this Court referred in the Maryland Casualty against Cushing case, the -- the purpose of the proceeding was then explained very clearly to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.990" offset="8243284">The purpose was to get a consensus or concursus in one proceeding to determine the liabilities as well as to distribute the fund.</text>

            <text syncTime="2397.422" offset="9693080">The same -- the rule in the state court -- the rule in the diversity cases too is that, if he sues for more than $3000 in the state court and the defendant removes, the plaintiff cannot deprive the federal court of jurisdiction by reducing the amount of his claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="2847.934" offset="11495111">If he's going to file one ever within six months of the first notice of claim, now it may well be that by the time six months have come and are about to expire, the claims will not exceed the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.055" offset="11547564">It may well be that these claimants will hold back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.541" offset="11561566">Indeed, I could give you cases that aren't in the books, but I know that that's been done as a strategy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.828" offset="11590719">If petitioner must allege that the claims exceeded the fund, he can be deprived of the right to limitation of liability entirely by the claimants getting together and just not filing more than one claim until after the six months have gone by and just giving him notice of one.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank C. Mason</label>
            <text syncTime="2911.177" offset="11748080">I think that it may clarify the picture, somewhat, if I should start from the beginning of this history of the opposing rights of a common law suitor as against this right of limitation granted by the 1851 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.748" offset="11854346">This Court in Langnes against Green, from which a great and -- and not that decision from -- that decision stemmed to great number of decisions in the Second Circuit under the Southern District Court having to do with this question as to the opposing right of the common law suitor and the right of the petitioner in limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.603" offset="11945775">In Langnes against Green, this Court cited the language of Judge Brawley in the case of the Lotta, an old District Court case in 150 Fed, in which he said, that the plaintiff had the right to pursue his remedy in the state court unless the Act providing for a limitation of liability clearly deprives him of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.517" offset="12077432">And further said, just the two sentences, if the Court please, the plaintiff is entitled to be heard on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.090" offset="12123721">That is and -- and in the usual cause of the common law proceeding, that issue can be fairly tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.164" offset="12148067">All that the petitioner can fairly claim is that he should not be subject to a personal judgment for an indefinite amount and beyond the value of his interest in the vessel and her freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.676" offset="12222046">Now, the right of limitation arises under Section 183, which formally was Section 4283 of the revised statutes, and which says that the liability of the owner, in a case of a loss caused without his privity or knowledge shall not exceed the value of his interest in the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.469" offset="12329253">On the other side of the picture, under title 28, Section 1333, we know, that the District Courts have original jurisdiction of any civil case of admiralty saving to suitors in all cases and all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.325" offset="12424652">Now, what occurred here was that this claimant started her suit in Supreme Court Ulster County (Inaudible) for the death of her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.391" offset="12472926">And within a few weeks, the restraining -- the petition was filed then a restraining order issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.635" offset="12505945">There was some preliminary motion there with respect to the amount of the security which was posted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.492" offset="12537292">My complaint being at the outset, that since we had sued the petitioner in the state court both as owner of the barge and as of the tug and charged her with negligence with respect to the personnel of both vessels, that it was -- should have been required to put up a bond for the barge as well as the tug.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.520" offset="12609494">The fault being charged to the barge, not relating to navigation, but to the fact that her lights were inadequate, a very simple issue as to the barge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.641" offset="12661948">My first motion before Judge Weinfeld was based on the premise that the fund composed of the two bonds now was $283,000 and the claims total $259,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.876" offset="12742928">The petitioner at that stage contended that the fund was inadequate on this theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.496" offset="12793396">It said before Judge Weinfeld that here was not one fund of $283,000 but that here were two separate funds, one for the tug of $118,000 and another for the barge of $165,000, and since the claims total $259,000, they said clearly, the claims exceeded each funds just the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.838" offset="12914709">Judge Weinfeld went along with that theory, denied my motion to lift the restraining order, the Court gave us permission to bring our claims to an amount reduced and to apply as to petitioner's liability as to each vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.695" offset="12990151">With the result, that by formal stipulation in which Mrs. Henn reduced her claim against the tug to $100,000, against the barge $250,000, the other claims in the limitation proceedings never had to be reduced although they were in greater amounts in the state court, they were always constant as $9500, therefore, the claims against petitioner's tug on worth was only $109,000 against the fund of $118,000 and against petitioner's barge owner in the sum of $159,000 as against the fund of $165,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.513" offset="13161409">I should mention too to the Court, all 11 claims were accounted for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.932" offset="13183143">There was no possibility here that there would be some secret claims appearing later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.487" offset="13213341">Now, Judge Weinfeld, upon the second motion then, following the petitioners own arguments on the first motion that here were two separate funds held in accordance with that theory lifted the restraining order because the fund was adequate for the tug and was adequate for the barge.Petitioner then took an appeal to the Court of Appeals complaining against that holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.085" offset="13335698">Although, as I cite in my brief, the language in Judge Weinfeld's opinion makes no doubt of the fact that that was the petitioner's position before him on the first motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.317" offset="13384600">And so -- and the Court of Appeals, it was again held, in line with what the petitioner contended, in line with what Judge Weinfeld held, that here, they would have to treat this proceeding as being composed of two funds, with respect to each of which the claims were less than the amounts of the funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="3416.890" offset="13770898">And they were all of the allegations that would be necessary to establish a right to file the petition for limitation, both with respect to the tug and the barge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.413" offset="13813008">But what was missing in the whole picture was that they trade for limitation of the petitioner and the tug, Eastern Cities for getting the barge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.475" offset="13861282">And they posted a bond originally, only, on behalf of the tug and the restraining order, we laid it not only to the tug but as to all claims against the petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="4876.178" offset="19608116">On the other hand, in order to safeguard that right, there have been very formal stipulations, partial releases, provisions in the order and this additional provision which the Circuit Court has -- the Court of Appeals has suggested, all designed not to benefit this claimant or respondent but to safeguard this very sacred right of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4901.947" offset="19711143">Now, then, I say to the Court in all frankness that while all that is going on, the petitioner, under the guise of claiming that concursus is such an important thing here, is in truth endeavoring to take from her, her sacred right to a common law trial before a jury in the form of her choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="5494.200" offset="22080136">It was one where the woman contended that you couldn't have limitation unless there was more than one claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="5502.285" offset="22112528">And she based that on the theory that these two sections which were then -- then known as 4284 and 4025, we've -- we've referred to a plurality of claims, and therefore, we had a single thing it couldn't have limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5517.275" offset="22172505">But the point I want to make is that in that case, this Court said, that the dominant statute in limitation is 4283 which says that a man may limit his liability to the value of his interest in the vessel and said, the succeeding sections are in the nature of an appendix and relate to proceedings by which the first is to be made effective.</text>

            <text syncTime="5780.082" offset="23223672">If Your Honor please, I think there's a very real danger and a very real difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="5784.052" offset="23239555">Let's look at what may happen in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5788.584" offset="23257736">Under the relaxation of the restraining order, this respondent can sue in the state court and let us assume for the moment that the state court will adopt the special verdict suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5798.931" offset="23299114">I see no reason why it should because it doesn't have anything to do with the liability in the state court but let's suppose it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="5808.652" offset="23337984">The Court of Appeals and Judge Weinfeld visualized a determination by the state court that either the tug or the barge or both was at fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="5818.989" offset="23379362">Well, let's suppose that the state court; the jury finds that they're both at fault then they get a judgment for whatever the jury fixes up to $250,000 and they bring that back to the limitation proceeding, as they must do under the restraining order and under the stipulation that the Court of Appeals made this respondent sign.</text>
            <text syncTime="5837.977" offset="23455326">But that decision, as to the liability of this petitioner as tug owner or barge owner, cannot be binding on the admiralty court because the limitation fund is measured by the in rem liability of tug or barge and it is conceded by this respondent in -- in her brief that only the admiralty court can decide that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5871.057" offset="23587610">And that is a necessary concession because this Court has so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="5874.893" offset="23602970">Therefore, it can very well cost us more in either one of two ways if we have to go to the state court and try the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5885.268" offset="23644453">Again, if the state court holds us liable because of some fault of tug and barge, they -- either they can recover on that in which case, it would cost us more than if the admiralty court holds only one vessel or it's entirely fruitless, meaningless, null, and void in every sense because only the admiralty court can decide which of these vessels is at fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="5912.476" offset="23753226">That is so inherent, so basic, so interwoven in the whole concept of limitation of liability that my friend concedes and this Court has held, other courts have held that that must be determined and can only be determined by the admiralty court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5927.287" offset="23812472">So, she tries a case in the state court and gets a judgment based upon the fault of both, she has to bring it back to the admiralty court and it's no good in the admiralty court because only the admiralty court can decide whether tug is at fault and whether barge is at fault.</text>

            <label>Mr. Eugene Underwood</label>
            <text syncTime="6312.844" offset="25354742">Thank you, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="6313.537" offset="25357563">I would like to mention now one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6318.000" offset="25375326">This is -- this is definitely a -- a single proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6323.204" offset="25396224">The petition beginning on -- on page 4 of the record in this case, if I may read a little bit of it to you, petitioner claims exemption from liability for the losses, damages, injuries and destruction occasioned or encouraged by or resulting from the aforesaid collision and losses and for the claims for damages that have been or may here be made and the petitioner alleges that it has valid defense as thereto on the facts and the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6356.342" offset="25528717">That is we filed this petition as one single solitary proceeding on behalf of one vessel owner who happened to own two vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="6366.480" offset="25569259">We pleaded the common ownership of both, we pleaded that both were seaworthy, we pleaded that we weren't liable for either, we pleaded that if we were, we were entitled to limitation of liability, and we gave bond only for the one because under this Court's decisions, only the one that's the controlling factor and that fault in rem is liable and we saw no possible way by which this barge could be held at fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="6393.092" offset="25675734">And at that time, and I cannot say this too earnestly, there was no claim by this respondent that the barge was guilty of any fault of her own.</text>
            <text syncTime="6402.915" offset="25715022">I made that point, I think, the first point in my reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6407.036" offset="25731532">Even so, we anticipated the possibility that there might be such a claim and in our petition, we -- we offered not only an interim stipulation for the value of the tug but we've also offered an interim stipulation for such additional interest as may be appropriate whenever the same shall be ordered by the Court.Therefore, by those words, I drew those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="6429.424" offset="25821080">We intended to offer a stipulation for the barge if at some future time, it should become necessary in the judgment of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6437.937" offset="25855143">So that this was one solitary proceeding and was intended to such in the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="6442.958" offset="25875205">Now, there were not ever two funds and it has never been my position that there are two funds in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6448.745" offset="25898402">It may be that I used a little inadvertent language in a brief that I wrote in -- in the District Court, there were two funds only in the sense that there were two different stipulations but my argument to Judge Weinfeld was that there was not yet any fund as indeed is still true, there is not yet any fund, we don't know what the fund is going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="6469.691" offset="25982098">At the moment, there is only security, two separate pieces of paper, it's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="6474.229" offset="26000280">But the security is for the value of the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="6476.698" offset="26010206">You can't tell what fund will -- what the fund will be until there has been a trial under merits and that can only be in the admiralty because only the admiralty can determine which of the vessels is liable in rem, state courts are incompetent to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6497.731" offset="26094320">I think that concludes my argument except for one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6501.271" offset="26108426">I'd like to express my final review on this question of concursus.</text>
            <text syncTime="6507.627" offset="26133922">It is not necessary in this case to go the whole way and say that concursus alone is enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="6514.671" offset="26162030">I -- in my brief suggested that it would be a workable rule in this cases as in the diversity cases to test the good faith of the petitioner when he files his petition, if at that time the claims are real and in good faith he apprehends the need for a concursus then he is entitled to file his petition and the jurisdiction of the Court should not thereafter be the football be at the whim of these claimants in reducing their claims.</text>
