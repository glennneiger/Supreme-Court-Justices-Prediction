            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- Cornelius Vanderbilt, Jr., Petitioner versus Patricia W. Vanderbilt and Thomas F. McCoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.759" offset="134457">Mr. Rosenblatt.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sol A. Rosenblatt</label>
            <text syncTime="15.686" offset="166118">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.679" offset="182105">I noted yesterday that the report of the Law Revision Commission which had not then been -- been supplied to Your Honors was to be forthcoming thereafter, I believe it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.247" offset="240410">And I want to call to your attention the fact that in this report of the Law Revision Commission recommending the legislation which I say is unconstitutionally applied against my client in the facts of this case, you won't find one word as to the effect of a New York ex parte decree being affected by this proposed legislation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="70.113" stopTime="72.326">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="70.113" offset="383875">The Court of Appeals held for what?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sol_a_rosenblatt" startTime="72.326" stopTime="517.794">
            <label>Mr. Sol A. Rosenblatt</label>
            <text syncTime="72.326" offset="392652">The Court of Appeals, sir, if I may interrupt my recital of facts but Your Honor was entitled to the answer at page 547 of this record said as follows, "We can go further however and declare that even if Section 1170-b was unavailable as against the New York divorce, that circumstance would not mean that the New York judgment was getting more than the Nevada judgment less faith and credit in New York."</text>
            <text syncTime="105.426" offset="525040">And I would rest my entire case on full faith and credit, sir, in this Court on the following statement of the New York Court of Appeals which is inaptly -- and inaptly applied here, says the Court, "Nevada's judgments put in evidence in New York are entitled to the same effect as they are given in Nevada."</text>
            <text syncTime="131.780" offset="630471">And to avoid unconstitutional discrimination, United States Constitution Article IV Section 2, the same effect New York's own similar judgments are given in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.079" offset="679685">The Court then goes on and says, "But under the divisible divorce doctrine, defendants Nevada divorce had no effect anymore than it said anything in terms as the plaintiff's property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.357" offset="728795">Its sole effect was to end the marriage and it is been given that effect in New York."</text>
            <text syncTime="161.216" offset="748231">May it please this Court, that is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.950" offset="767143">A Nevada decree ex parte entered in Nevada forecloses a further duty of support to the wife guilty of misconduct under the laws of Nevada and in New York, may it please the Court, the same law and the same rule applies as it does also in the State of California which was the law of the matrimonial domicile of these parties at the time of their separation.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.024" offset="891486">What the New York court has done is to give partial effect to the Nevada decree as applied in New York as against its own decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.324" offset="956688">Now, if I may interject because I want to pursue this a little later if I may with Your Honors permission, I would like to give you the facts of this case so that you may judge for yourselves whether or not in spite of the New York Court of Appeals' determination as under its own state law whether or not full faith and credit and the privileges and immunity of this man, who happen to have been a 20-year permanent domiciliary of the State of Nevada, were impinged by the action of the New York court.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.154" offset="1144038">You see, may it please the Court, at the very outset a New York judgment, once it's rendered is conclusive until it's set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.366" offset="1212792">It may not then be modified thereafter for some future equity apparently arising.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.998" offset="1239333">That's the Herpe case in 225 New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.331" offset="1256678">A New York judgment ex parte or with appearances cuts off and forecloses all rights to a wife guilty of misconduct under the law of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.376" offset="1312893">And there isn't a New York lawyer, including myself, who would dare after an ex parte decree had been rendered against the woman in New York, who would dare I say to file in a New York Supreme Court an action for separation, divorce, or annulment with that ex parte decree outstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.267" offset="1428459">Because first of all, the woman would be guilty of perjury when she swore that she was married and she has to swear that when she bring such an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.065" offset="1467643">And second, the statutory provisions requiring that that judgment is conclusive as to everything which it determines until it sets aside would prevent the filing of that kind of an action under 1170-b.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.970" offset="1543293">You just couldn't file this kind of a case if New York had made an ex parte decree theretofore.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.804" offset="1570565">It's impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.658" offset="1577984">And a lawyer practicing before the Bar in New York would have to advice his client that the first thing to do is to go in and set aside that decree if it's possible to set it aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.509" offset="1637439">That couldn't be done if it was already been outstanding for two years on any ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.204" offset="1660217">Now, what happened here?</text>
            <text syncTime="392.764" offset="1674428">And in a sense, this is an ex parte action, too, in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.896" offset="1690937">This very case which you're called upon to determine because after the first case was instituted by Mrs. Vanderbilt, and nobody yet has ever discovered the reason why with a matrimonial domicile in California, with assets and property in California, why she tried to commence an action in New York and falsely swear that both of them were residents, nobody yet has been able to discover that.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.205" offset="1808175">She had plenty of recourse right in the State of California where she was located, but she started an action in New York and it took us months and hundreds of pages of testimony and hundreds of exhibits to get that action dismissed on the ground that neither of these parties had ever been a resident of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.948" offset="1895215">Now, that was done in February of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.166" offset="1920084">But her appeal was pending until February of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.865" offset="1950804">She says that in February of 1953, she came from California to New York and that she then took domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.235" offset="1992286">I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.341" offset="2000750">However, let's take her statement that she took domicile on February 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.691" offset="2038157">She had no right when she came to New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.989" offset="2051323">She had not been a resident as required by the New York statute and she could have no rights as a wife until one year of matrimonial residence had ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.963" offset="2107225">That's the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.277" offset="2112449">I didn't make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.012" offset="2119450">But no woman can sue in a matrimonial action in New York unless she's had one year of residence which is interpreted to mean domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.280" offset="2168456">So in February of 1953 --</text>

            <text syncTime="531.750" offset="2230418">We'll be delighted to send them.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.553" offset="2249540">What happened was that in April of 1953 -- now, her case for separation had been dismissed in February 1953 and she taken an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.011" offset="2299382">In April 1953, this statute became law, this 1170-b, April 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.584" offset="2345671">In the mean time, Mr. Vanderbilt in March had gone back to his old domicile of Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.598" offset="2377749">And by the way, all the courts have found that his domicile there was legitimate, had been consistently maintain and that when he returned, it was proper return to his former domicile and he still domiciled there and all the courts have so held in their determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.600" offset="2473775">Nothing happened until a suit was commenced for divorce by Mr. Vanderbilt in Nevada, in June, and he served the papers on Mrs. Vanderbilt in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.209" offset="2532185">And she promptly went into that other action which was pending and she made a motion to stop this divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.867" offset="2574817">That motion was denied by the Supreme Court of New York County and Mr. Vanderbilt received the divorce June 30, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.483" offset="2633331">Now, nothing happened thereafter until April of 1954 and that's the inception of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.928" offset="2671052">In April of 1954, Mrs. Vanderbilt in New York brings a simple action for separation.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.502" offset="2717341">It says on the summons which is required to be stated in the New York practice, action for separation.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.708" offset="2746180">It doesn't say action for maintenance in case the separation is denied, it says action for separation.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.493" offset="2777318">And in her complaint she swears that she's married and that this man is guilty of all sorts of things and that she ask for support under the Separation Law of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.600" offset="2833742">And at the same time, she sequestrates the property which Mr. Vanderbilt had then come in due -- due to the death of his mother which were trusts, inalienable trust long established in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.398" offset="2896959">He'd never brought them there, they just existed in New York and she seized and attached all those trust and their -- and the property, that's why you have a sequestrator in here because he's still in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.692" offset="2962160">She couldn't have sequestered a New York citizen's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.934" offset="2991104">She wouldn't have been entitled to the writ because New York resident would have been amenable to any jurisdiction of the New York court by service even outside in the State of New York just as a California citizen is amenable to California process by being served outside the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.900" offset="3078980">And she couldn't have commenced this action under 1170-b against her New York husband without saying that she'd been divorced by a decree of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.204" offset="3128195">So she couldn't have sequestrated under any circumstances and actually if her papers had told the truth on the sequestration, if she'd said that she'd been divorced but the divorce was no good, she couldn't sequestrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.962" offset="3199248">If she said that she was seeking relief under 1170-b, she still couldn't sequestrate until the Court might decide in her favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.981" offset="3247313">But she got a sequestration tied up everything at this man and has lived very well ever since including lawyers and bills and charges and everything else out of his sequestrated funds which maybe is the right thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.799" offset="3306559">I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.292" offset="3312515">That's possible but I don't think it's the right thing when it's founded upon a process rounded in iniquity, rounded in perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.923" offset="3363088">She has to swear falsely to bring this suit and she has to swear falsely to get the sequestration.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.279" offset="3396524">And then she has to swear falsely when she says that she's suing for separation or she's not suing for anything of the kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.853" offset="3430797">She's suing for what we call maintenance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1468.595" offset="5977736">Let me take a look further into the record in reciting the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.615" offset="6001873">Having put into special appearance and entering into the trial of the case, the motion was made for a separate trial as to the validity of this Nevada decree in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.850" offset="6074807">The Court, however, said it wouldn't take up the question of the validity of the Nevada decree which had never been mentioned in the plaintiff's complaint, but it said and I'm reading at page 39 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.449" offset="6145128">And I said, rather, "What Your Honor is doing then is at the same time that you're going to take testimony on whether or not the decree is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.860" offset="6178774">You are going also to take testimony on the very issue that was decided by that decree so that if the decree is valid, all this testimony has to be stricken out."</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.422" offset="6213047">The Court," I will do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.270" offset="6220466">We can do that."</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.802" offset="6226631">"Mr. Rosenblatt, don't you think that's a little prejudicial to this defendant, Your Honor?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.442" offset="6245125">The Court, "What prejudice can he suffer?</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.966" offset="6255261">If he is successful, he has suffered nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.800" offset="6266546">If he's not successful, we have tried the entire case."</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.891" offset="6282951">Now, this case of the plaintiffs was put in and after motions to dismiss they asked them for the right to be heard on the question of the Nevada decree, there was no evidence other than that characterized by the Appellate Division as meager against this Nevada decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.490" offset="6361318">And so the Court made its decision and it said at page 344 or rather I -- I want to revert just before the decision of the Court to what happened because all these courts have taken the position, the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, and the Court of Appeals have all taken the position that there's nothing against the statements of this plaintiff on the question of any misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.618" offset="6485870">The Court said at page 342, "In the event that I do not rule in favor of the defendant on the question of the validity of the Nevada decree and on the question of the domicile of the defendant in Nevada at that time, then of course if you have any evidence to offer in connection with your defense to the action of separation based on cruel and inhuman treatment and nonsupport, at that time you may be free to offer whatever evidence you may want to in connection with that particular phase of the case."</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.401" offset="6592972">So then the motion was determined and the Court holds at page 348 and as recited right in the judgment which is appealed from -- rather page 344, bottom paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.510" offset="6645426">The first affirmative defense of the defendant therefore is a bar to the plaintiff's action for a separation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.078" offset="6667682">And being sustained, the complaint bearing on this issue must be dismissed upon the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.404" offset="6688998">Now then, we have a dismissal on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.269" offset="6704462">The Court then proceeds to take evidence in spite of the dismissal on the merits, the separation case is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.026" offset="6735496">So the -- the judge then does not hear any new testimony except on the income and the desire -- income of the defendant and the desires of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.266" offset="6776456">We say that that has been a deprival of due process to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.844" offset="6806758">We were called in to meet a separation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.215" offset="6820237">We succeeded in having it dismissed on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.520" offset="6837478">A dismissal on the merits means that we don't have to go on but then the Court went ahead, listened to what the plaintiff said that she needed $3500 a month or something and awards her $250 a week et cetera, et cetera since the commencement of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.378" offset="6912920">That couldn't happen to a New York man either because if you take a separation case in New York and you win the separation case against the woman, she's entitled to nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.036" offset="6963493">But if you plead 1770-b and win your case, she's entitled to maintenance, very interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.447" offset="7001109">It couldn't happen to a New York citizen under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.506" offset="7021380">I would like to withhold the balance of my time until the rebuttal with the Court's permission.</text>

            <text syncTime="1746.675" offset="7090030">Mr. Rosenblatt has made many strong assertions which I do not believe can be legally sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.571" offset="7141648">On page 5 and 6 of my brief, I have attempted to set out in chronological order the operative facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.312" offset="7196609">Your Honors should bear in mind that this trial, although vigorously defendant was not attended by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.468" offset="7241226">He chose to remain absent from this trial for many significant reasons and the facts in this case are either established by uncontradicted evidence or by the defendant's admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.374" offset="7308831">However, in many instances, certain of those defendant's admissions were inconsistent and contradictory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.634" offset="7341955">That is the only contradiction on the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.113" offset="7355852">The contradictions made by the defendant himself in sworn or written admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.532" offset="7381452">Now, in 1945, we have an affidavit sworn to by the defendant that he was domicile in California since 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.447" offset="7429204">He made this affidavit in 1953 -- or 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.539" offset="7453550">So that's starting with 1945, the defendant is a California domiciliary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.826" offset="7482702">The marriage took place in 1948 in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.733" offset="7506317">Mr. Rosenblatt's claim that the defendant was a Nevada resident stands from this fact only that in his marriage certificate, he stated his residence as Nevada in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.435" offset="7561070">As against that we have his contradictory statement in a sworn affidavit to the New York court in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.241" offset="7592312">I should say that that statement was made in his marriage certificate in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.111" offset="7615822">This sworn affidavit in 1952 says, however, "I have been a domiciliary of California since 1945."</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.362" offset="7660857">Perhaps he might have been a resident of Nevada prior thereto but it's not an operative significant fact of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2284.830" offset="9242728">In other words, Nevada under that statute may grant maintenance to a wife even though the Court should hold that she was a guilty and not an innocent party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.918" offset="9303019">And that statute contemplates an inquiry by the Court into the financial means of both parties, their resources, in order to determine whether even a guilty wife may be awarded maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.804" offset="9362578">Now, with that background, with that statutory background, also with the background of the Estin case and Pennoyer against Neff, and in the absence of any inquiry by the Nevada court into the financial circumstances and bearing in mind that the Nevada court could have granted alimony to a guilty wife, I believe that the record justifies a presumption that the -- that the Nevada court did not purport to disregard the decisions of this Court in Estin against Estin with respect to its jurisdictional power to determine personal rights of an absentee non-resident spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.967" offset="9531225">That is the basis upon which I make that second assertion, if Your Honor pleases, with the background of that Nevada statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2408.108" offset="9735816">Well, after that action had been dismissed and while an abortive appeal was pending at that time, the defendant went to Nevada and commenced this divorce action, ex parte by publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.606" offset="9805824">When plaintiff was served with these papers in New York, her counsel at that time made a motion in that action which had been dismissed to enjoin the prosecution of a Nevada action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.305" offset="9868622">That motion was determined on July 3rd, which was three days after the defendant obtained his ex parte divorce decree in Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.838" offset="9910732">The motion was therefore denied on a two-fold ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.727" offset="9926301">First, that a motion for an injunction could not be granted in an action which had already been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2465.619" offset="9965798">However, the secondary ground was that the Nevada action having already proceeded the judgment, an action to enjoin the prosecution of that action was moot and academic.</text>

            <label>Mr. Monroe J. Winsten</label>
            <text syncTime="3009.836" offset="12142738">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.515" offset="12153396">The way I have read the balance of the opinion of the Estin case indicates to me as my belief that this Court did not intend to interpret the situation upon the narrow base of a prior judgment and that belief is strengthened by Mr. Justice's -- Justice Black's concurring opinion in the Armstrong case where he said just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.130" offset="12279933">Mr. Justice Black in his opinion in the Armstrong case said this that Mrs. Estin's right reduced to judgment was no greater a right than Mrs. Armstrong's right unreduced to judgment, and they were both entitled to the protection of the Due Process Clause of the Federal Constitution, that no state could divest those rights, personal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.288" offset="12380557">One reduced to judgment, the other unreduced to judgment without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.770" offset="12398425">And due process of law implies jurisdiction to render a judgment against the person and having that person before that court and under its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.252" offset="12436355">For those reasons I have interpreted, the Estin case to me what I said I did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.976" offset="12459238">Now, going to the next question of discrimination, that question is brought -- has been brought into this case and I believe that it doesn't belong here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.607" offset="12513782">We are not required to grope for the legislative intent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.969" offset="12539277">The legislative intent in this case is furnished by the report of the Law Revision Commission and when the Law Revision Commission proposed this legislation with respect to discrimination it said, "In order to avoid discrimination," I quote that on page 25 of my brief, "Against foreign divorces," against which the Estin opinion won.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.706" offset="12670203">Such legislation should be made applicable whether the husband's ex parte adjudication of marital status was obtained in a foreign court or a New York court."</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.536" offset="12717537">Now, I don't know how and won't clearly nondiscrimination could have been expressed on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.158" offset="12752018">And looking at the statute itself which is in the petitioner's brief on page 4, the statute does not delimit the ex parte judgment to those rendered in foreign jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.076" offset="12827669">It talks about ex parte judgments rendered in all jurisdictions including New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.962" offset="12851179">And the New York Court of Appeals in this case, when the question of discrimination was raised below, reaffirmed the interpretation and the intent of the Law Revision Commission by saying that it did not interpret this statute as having no effect on New York judgments, that it did interpret the statute as having equal effect on New York judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.439" offset="12957132">And Mr. Rosenblatt, when he -- in response to Mr. Justice Harlan's question on that point, started to read at a point subsequent to the -- this declaration of the New York Court of Appeals in this case and this is what the New York Court of Appeals said, he didn't begin on page 546, he began on page 547.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.993" offset="13039365">And on -- in 546 of the record the Court of Appeals said, "As to defendant's first assumption there is nothing in our statute to support the conclusion that it is inapplicable where the prior judgment was obtained in New York."</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.073" offset="13111672">Well, the Law Revision Commission report a recommendation certainly makes no such distinction but instead recommends applicability whether the husband's ex parte adjudication of marital status was obtained in a foreign court or a New York court, page 468.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.981" offset="13183248">Actually, the basis for this assumption by defendant is an idea which pervades defendant's whole argument and that is whether this fundamental and unchangeable law, New York law, that an already divorced wife may never be awarded maintenance by a New York court and that an action for separation or divorce in New York presupposes an existing valid marriage.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sol A. Rosenblatt</label>
            <text syncTime="5460.724" offset="21946284">The Court of Appeals said and by the way when this present action was instituted, the papers was served on the defendant in Nevada that there was sufficient evidence to justify the findings below as to the defendant's good faith domiciled in Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="5477.931" offset="22015143">I quote from the record at page 542.</text>
            <text syncTime="5480.324" offset="22024652">"That proof included a showing that Nevada -- defendant had lived in voted known property in Nevada for many years before his marriage to plaintiff that plaintiff and defendant lived there together in the early months of their marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5492.551" offset="22073553">That defendant returned there some months before the divorce and that defendant has continuously maintained his residence in Nevada since the divorce."</text>
            <text syncTime="5501.229" offset="22108244">May it please the Court, I say that this was an ex parte decree rendered by New York because our rights were preserved in our answer by special permission of the New York court to continue our objections to both the jurisdiction of the Court in personam and in rem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5527.153" offset="22212002">Secondly, we have never appeared in personam in New York for the simple reason that in addition to confiscation of whatever assets he has, which will forever be under the egest of this sequestrator, might very well be put in jail at some point under the New York penal laws for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5552.762" offset="22314402">I would like to say that whether the decree was rendered in Nevada, Alabama, New Jersey or any of the States requiring different periods of residents, my basic contention in this case on the full faith and credit point is that that decree whether its Nevada, Alabama, California, which was the domicile of these parties when they were separated, should be given the same full force and effect in New York as a New York ex parte decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="5598.499" offset="22497364">Now, Mr. Justice Harlan asked a very interesting question which I opposed in the Appellate Division to my opponent because since the decree was rendered in Nevada less than the period required for the plaintiff to have a residence requirement fulfilled in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="5622.905" offset="22594957">In other words, she'd been there a little over three months and it took one year before her rights ripened into bringing an action, you can't sue for divorce in New Jersey until you've observed the residential requirements for a number of years or in Alabama or any other State of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5643.323" offset="22676668">So in New York it requires one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="5647.190" offset="22692133">This lady having taken residence in New York had no rights under the New York statute until one year had passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5654.567" offset="22721599">In the meantime, she'd been divorced.</text>
            <text syncTime="5658.302" offset="22736541">Now, may it please the Court, when I asked the question, what would happen in the Appellate Division?</text>
            <text syncTime="5667.031" offset="22771545">What would happen if there were a New York decree and that decree have become final, could the lady, fleeing from New York to another jurisdiction, return to New York thereafter at some future time and then commence the proceeding for a divorce, swearing that she was married and asking for maintenance in New York, my friend gave the same answer, there he said they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="5698.253" offset="22896410">A New York man -- New York woman could do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5702.309" offset="22912606">It was on that basis that Mr. Justice Peck in the Appellate Division, presiding judge of the Court said at page 540, "I am unable to see how Section 1170-b would be made applicable to cases where the divorce was granted at the State of New York."</text>
            <text syncTime="5722.334" offset="22992750">If it is not so applicable, it is discriminatory and violative of the constitutional provision respecting the equal protection of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5730.626" offset="23025873">So then I must then meet the question from the bench with respect to New York's finding at page 546 and 547 brought out by Mr. Justice Brennan in the sentence but Section 1170-b to the extent that it applies as change that old New York policy and I said at the very outset of my argument if Your Honor will recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="5762.954" offset="23155231">I said, "I would stand on the question of full faith and credit in this case on the statement of the New York Court of Appeals following that statement that Nevada's judgments put in evidence in New York are entitled to the same effect as they are given in Nevada and to avoid unconstitutional discrimination, the same effect New York's own similar judgments are given in New York."</text>
            <text syncTime="5789.080" offset="23259721">But I'm not here only on the question of how little faith and credit has been given to this Nevada decree, but I'm here on the question of the privileges and immunities of citizens of different States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5804.780" offset="23322520">I'm asking this Court to observe the admonition which was given to me years ago by a very famous law professor named Zechariah Chafee, now deceased, when he said that equity follows the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5823.213" offset="23396185">I think that's still good and I see no reason why, as applied in this case, equity should be made to follow the woman instead of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5836.219" offset="23448221">And that's what's been happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="5838.881" offset="23458879">Your Honors have said again and again and in the dissenting opinion in the Armstrong case, made the statement that the right of support is a property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5853.352" offset="23516766">That doesn't happen to be so under the law of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="5857.415" offset="23533066">There is no such property right until it's vest by determination of a court any more that there's any right in a divorced woman to take an interest in their husbands estate which is given by New York law or for a divorced woman, divorced for cause in the State of New Jersey to enjoy dower which is an inchoate right also arising from the marital relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="5883.875" offset="23638915">These inchoate rights must flower in the property rights by decree of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5891.321" offset="23668694">They cannot be established by a legislative action without a Court then observing their basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5904.768" offset="23722402">Here, by dismissing this complaint and the judgment appealed from said so, says that this is an act of a separation and the complaint is dismissed on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="5916.842" offset="23770781">Page 3 of the record, what it says, "By dismissing this action for a separation and then going on to give maintenance is something that while intended perhaps well has been improperly and unconscionably brought about against this defendant in this case."</text>
            <text syncTime="5941.556" offset="23869628">And I say that if you will study not only the prevailing but also the dissenting opinions, you will find that the interest which you found in the Estin prevailing opinion, where New York had an interest in this Estin woman and as observed by my friend that New York has an interest in Mrs. Vanderbilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5967.737" offset="23974327">You will find at page 553, the very wise and sage observation of one of our great judges in New York, Judge Fuld, who says that even in this case, only by confining the statute to the situation where the wife had standing to institute the matrimonial action in this State at the time that the foreign divorce was granted, may New York's dealings with such a broken marriage be restricted "to the matters of her dominant concern," citing Estin versus Estin, and unseemly conflicts between this State and other jurisdictions avoidable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6009.603" offset="24141824">I think that Your Honors must understand clearly as what's said by Judge Fuld at page 552, the bottom, at the time the Nevada judgment of divorce was rendered, plaintiff wife had no standing in New York to maintain the present action for separation and by that token had no enforceable right to invoke the benefits of the Section.</text>
