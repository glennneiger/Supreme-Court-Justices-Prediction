            <label>Mr. Daniel H. Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="6.603" offset="129755">Thank you, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.334" offset="144697">I was at the point in the -- in detailing the advancement of this case and I will turn now to the last day, the day on which alcohol was discovered at the garage and the day on which all of the defendants were apprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.310" offset="200600">This day, December 28, 1951, the facts as proven by the Government's agents, and I might say at this point that all of the evidence was introduced by the Government, either through Government agents or the testimony of witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.334" offset="260681">And other than by cross-examination, the defendants offered no direct proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.009" offset="283460">On December 28, the defendant, Margiasso and King, met at the service station, the Bruckner Boulevard service station.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.329" offset="324733">And there, Margiasso took King's car and went away.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.313" offset="344586">King remained there and after a little while, Delli Paoli showed up and his car was placed on the greasing rack and while his car was being serviced, he and King engaged in conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.614" offset="389831">All of this was observed by Government agents observing this gas station through field glasses from some distance away.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.116" offset="423790">After -- after Delli Paoli's car was finished being serviced, it was taken off the rack and thereafter, the two men continued to be with each other until Margiasso returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.282" offset="472482">And at that moment, King got into his car and drove away and he drove from this point in the east Bronx down to Harlem where he was apprehended by the agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.032" offset="515532">They followed him from the service station and a number of cans of -- of bootleg were found in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.663" offset="553984">Nothing further was observed during -- and this was in the early part of the evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.385" offset="568926">Nothing further was observed until Margiasso was seen to come back to the service station at about 10 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.844" offset="602781">Delli Paoli's whereabouts were not known and the agents watched Margiasso, and pretty soon, Whitley showed up.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.617" offset="629844">Now, Whitley came to the service station.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.874" offset="646875">Margiasso got out of his car and went into Whitley's car and drove it away and drove to this -- to this garage at Harding Park, the house location.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.881" offset="690866">And there, Margiasso was observed to open the garage doors, but evidently, something alerted him because leaving the garage doors open, he got back into Whitley's car and started to drive away when the agents seized him.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.272" offset="748440">And on this person, they found keys which fitted the lock of this -- of the garage.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.424" offset="765053">They went back to the garage.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.709" offset="770173">The doors were open and located inside the garage were 153 five-gallon cans of alcohol.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.635" offset="801938">They took Margiasso back to the service station where Whitley was found and he had a brown paper bag with a thousand dollars in cash in -- inside the bag and these men were arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.013" offset="851466">And as the agents started to leave, Delli Paoli started to drive into the service station.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.382" offset="876857">One of the agents, a man named Fay, engaged Delli Paoli in conversation and after a few moments, Delli Paoli started to back out of the service station.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.724" offset="914265">And as he did so, a car was brought up alongside of him and then a police car came in behind them and so he was prevented from backing out of the service station.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.290" offset="948537">The reason I detail those facts is because the Government has claimed that this was an attempt to flee on the part of Delli Paoli, which would be evidence of consciousness of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.211" offset="1000260">Agent Fay, the man who engaged Delli Paoli in conversation was never called as a witness nor was his absence unexplained.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.970" offset="1027218">The only evidence we have as to the kind of conversation was agent (Inaudible) characterization that they appeared to be having some sort of an argument, that is, Fay and Delli Paoli.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.776" offset="1074448">But what was said, we don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.559" offset="1085628">The Government claimed in the court below that this was attempted escape, which could properly be considered by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.859" offset="1118856">I countered that -- that there was no such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.733" offset="1130350">The majority of the Court of Appeals said nothing about it, they ignored the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.918" offset="1151039">And Judge Frank in dissent said that it's hardly evidence of escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.848" offset="1170787">They pressed the point here too.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.791" offset="1178520">There's nothing to show that Delli Paoli knew he was being interrogated or being apprehended by a Government agent or by any other police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.522" offset="1213419">You have the same sort of situation as this Court passed upon in the Di Re case where a -- where we had an arrest of a man who was subsequently found to have illicit ration -- gasoline ration stamps on this person who did not protest his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.918" offset="1283009">And in this case, we don't know what the conversation between the two persons was.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.538" offset="1301504">We don't know what prompted Delli Paoli to back out at the service station because the record is completely barren in all of these facts.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel H. Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="331.153" offset="1427937">No, he never lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.856" offset="1430758">He lived in the neighborhood and everything here happened within the radius of -- of a few blocks of where Pierro lived, Margiasso lived and Delli Paoli livee, and where the service station was also located.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.381" offset="1476942">I doubt that the distance between any of these places was more than a mile.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.939" offset="1495124">Although at the place where King was apprehended in Harlem was more than six miles away through some of the most heavily traffic streets of the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.438" offset="1533158">Now, five days after these men were apprehended, and it's conceded by all that the conspiracy terminated with the arrest of these defendants, Whitley accompanied by his lawyer, went to the offices of the Alcohol Tax Unit and there, he executed a detailed confession, which is printed as an appendix to Judge Frank's dissenting opinion, which is printed as an appendix to the petitioner's brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.469" offset="1645275">And this confession, if Your Honors would read it, would observe, spells out quite in some detail the Government's theory of this case that is the long-range conspiracy culminating in the events of the final night and approximately two of the three pages are dealt with particularity with the details of the alleged criminal conduct of Delli Paoli and it is petitioner's argument, that this is the only evidence of substance in the case against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.822" offset="1774634">Of course, when it was received in evidence on the trial as the last bit of proof offered by the Government, it was scrupulously directed to the jury that they were not to consider it as evidence against anybody but the confessor, Whitley.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.445" offset="1841194">It was not evidence against any of the other persons named therein and was not to be considered by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.483" offset="1865331">Of course, objection was made to the offer of proof of this confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.981" offset="1887274">Suggestions were made that the names of the codefendants on trial ought to be deleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.221" offset="1912247">This suggestion was rejected and the jury had the full details of it before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.171" offset="1944012">It was read to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.967" offset="1951222">There's no mention in the record that the jury had it in the jury room with them during their deliberations but being quite familiar with the practices in the southern district, I can say that they most likely did have this and the other exhibits, other physical documents in the jury room with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.675" offset="2022066">They were made available to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.422" offset="2033037">Now, if I may, I would like to turn first with -- with Your Honor's consent to the second point of my brief and that is the propriety of receiving in evidence this confession by Whitley and its use in adjudicating the guilt of the petitioner Delli Paoli.</text>

            <text syncTime="524.020" offset="2199489">At the end of all -- well, let me say that at the beginning, the only inference made at any point in the trial that there was to be any evidence of any admissions was in the opening statement of the prosecutor to the effect that Whitley admitted that he bought alcohol from Delli Paoli, and that appears at page 12 of the record in the following fashion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1457.499" offset="5933328">The first thing that would happen is Margiasso, the man who drove the cars, would appear at that filling station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.858" offset="5962794">That happened each time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.445" offset="5969168">He was there before this thing happened and so clearly by appointment that we can't rely on the laws of chance or just good company or loneliness to account for each of the three instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.213" offset="6012217">On December 18, that night, on December 28, that night, and then later, again, the same pattern, he appeared first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.844" offset="6046699">He conferred with Margiasso.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.278" offset="6052446">They were seen talking by the agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.114" offset="6063835">Then, petitioner would either leave or he would sit around with a man characterized as the buyer and Margiasso will take the buyer's car, drive to the garage, and we have little doubt as to his filling it each time because there is affirmative testimony that each time that car was returned by Margiasso, it was heavily laid and the back was down, and of course the second time they caught the car and it was found to contain 90 -- 95 gallons of unstamped alcohol.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.217" offset="6188283">And the third time of course, the same pattern, petitioner went away and then when he came back before Margiasso should return, of course, Margiasso had been arrested, but the petitioner was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.037" offset="6239483">Now, the jury was not apprised by that clear testimony as to what the -- the petitioner's status was in the transaction, but it was very clear that he was the man that was to be there at every transfer, whether he was the supervisor, the collecting agent, or what, but he was there each time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.043" offset="6327568">It was not an -- a single case without anything in the whole collocation of evidence as in the raid where he happened to be there at -- at a time when someone else entirely was being arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.871" offset="6374902">He was there each time and when he drove up that last time, of course, Margiasso wasn't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.112" offset="6403845">Whitley had been arrested with a thousand dollars in a paper bag, and we shant take the time to quarrel as to whether he tried to escape or not because it's very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.775" offset="6446477">He tried to back out of there when the agents talked to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.001" offset="6459329">And he would have made good his escape if another agent's car hadn't blocked him off and if a police -- police cruiser hadn't come up to the side so much for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.500" offset="6493393">I mention this in such detail because what was before this jury told that jury everything with uncontradicted testimony as a result of good, high-class investigative work over a long period of time by the alcohol agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.117" offset="6563819">That jury had before it every detail that was in the confession except the one additional item that Whitley after describing that process which had been fully described in the testimony and attested on three of these patterned occasions, Whitley added the fact that petitioner was there as the collecting agent, which added not a great deal, but we're not here arguing a case on the theory that there was an error here which was harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.939" offset="6683146">We're contending that under the federal rules of criminal procedure as under the statute of Congress before that, joint trials are an accepted matter of procedure and the courts rely on those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.748" offset="6734346">There is no exception in the federal rules of criminal procedure taking away the specific discretion of the trial judge to prevent abuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.743" offset="6778337">So we are not arguing here that there was an error which we say was harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.600" offset="6801742">We are arguing here that there was no error in admitting a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.412" offset="6825044">It was properly safeguarded because that is within the right of the judge under the rules and under the decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.994" offset="6855346">I want to quote here from a case which was measurably more difficult than this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.519" offset="6877497">The Opper case, in which there was serious question as to whether a person accused of bribing a government employee had actually done so, and in that case, the employee's confession Hollifield was admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.444" offset="6949177">Mr. Justice Reed, speaking for the Court, in answer to exactly the contention that is here made said this, and I read.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.234" offset="6984286">“The trial judge here made clear and repeated admonitions to the jury at appropriate times that Hollifield's incriminatory statements were not to be considered in establishing the guilt of the petitioner to say that the jury might have been confused amounts to nothing more than an unfounded speculation that the jurors disregarded clear instructions of the Court in arriving at their verdict."</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.813" offset="7102673">Our theory of trial relies upon the ability of a jury to follow instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.029" offset="7131512">There is nothing in this record to call for reversal because of any confusion or injustice arising from the joint trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.673" offset="7166098">Now this disposition of exactly the contention here in a much worse case is -- was nothing new.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.516" offset="7197445">In Lutwak, the Court made the same disposition despite the greater seriousness of that case as attested in the dissent of Mr. Justice Frankfurter, Mr. Justice Jackson, which pointed out that in that case, there was not just as in this case one single confession to be kept from all the rest of the evidence, but there were eight occasions which was pointed out in the dissent in which evidence was admitted against this or that defendant and not against the rest of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.855" offset="7330774">And in the opinion of this Court in Lutwak, despite the fact that that had been vigorously pointed out and despite the fact that obviously is a much tougher case than one in which only a single admission is the subject of a caution to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.809" offset="7402559">In that case, this Court stated that they recognized the burden on the jury, and again, implicitly recognized that juries have to be trusted with things infinitely more dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.688" offset="7450102">Juries are constantly cautioned not to allow their prejudices to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.973" offset="7467238">They're cautioned not to allow the fact that defendant does not take the stand, that they must not give any effect to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.404" offset="7504959">And by and large, if the jury system is to survive, it must be -- the jury must be considered as having some integrity and some sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.787" offset="7542471">Now, in that case, the -- this Court, in Lutwak, stated, all these difficulties have been pointed out in several cases citing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.093" offset="7587715">The rule has, nonetheless, been applied and it's cited at Blumenthal, which is a yet earlier case of this Court in which a group of persons selling whisky over the OPA scale price were brought together and admissions of some were admitted against themselves and not against others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.581" offset="7665664">The Government is aware of the problem, but we think that the solution of it, to throw up hands and just about vitiate all the opportunity for joint trials by saying that you simply can't have a joint trial, if there's an item of evidence, as in this case, a single item of evidence that can't be used against all of them, you can't have a joint trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.459" offset="7753226">Well, that's too extreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.607" offset="7757824">We think that that is a retroactive changing of the rules after the trial has been held under the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.739" offset="7786350">We may submit also that if this Court were sitting today as a legislative body, being asked to change the rules are to enact law, that it would require pretty serious consideration to make an absolute rule that you can't have joint trials unless every item of evidence can be used against each defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.717" offset="7874226">The Congress, when it first enacted the joint trial statute did so in recognition of the fact that these were piling up in cases against defendants and there is also protection for the defendants in the fact that if you had five separate trials, their expenses would go up and the question of how they might be prejudiced would depend on the order trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.152" offset="7967953">So we say that -- that in this case to retroactively change the rules and make an arbitrary assumption on a sort of a psychological speculation that this Court has rejected three times, is something that doesn't -- isn't called for in the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.878" offset="8042872">Now, somewhat tied in with this, of course, is the question of what was there before this jury, in addition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.498" offset="8069413">I have mentioned this extremely clear pattern of how this worked and that was proved as I say again independently except that one detail by the testimony of good police work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.824" offset="8134719">But that isn't all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.783" offset="8138480">It isn't to be considered the object of a conspiracy statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.135" offset="8155930">It's not -- it is to enable all of the people who really conspire and who are in the agreement to be tried and to show the entire pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.363" offset="8204831">Now, these three patterns that -- that -- in which petitioner was caught were not exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.330" offset="8236701">They are not something that just happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.267" offset="8244433">The -- the alcohol agents were watching, the two physical plants involved in this matter for a couple of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.561" offset="8281631">I'll go back to 1949, the beginning of the conspiracy, the first thing that happened, and I'll have to go quickly and I'm afraid in adequately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.527" offset="8313501">The first thing that happened was when they bought that garage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.388" offset="8324890">The Government put on the witness, as witness, the owner of that garage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.427" offset="8341086">He said he had mentioned in the neighborhood tavern that he had the cottage and garage for sale, but it's clear on specific questions and answers that he was approached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.000" offset="8379329">He did not approach Pierro, who started the negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.315" offset="8396675">What is also in the record and what is omitted is that again, petitioner was the man who was always there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.887" offset="8422902">Pierro worked on the negotiations and did the talking, but by his side in the conversations related to this cottage were already, petitioner and Margiasso.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.239" offset="8472325">Then it was petitioner and Pierro who went up and sized up that cottage for nearly an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.154" offset="8495940">That's all in the record and this -- the test is -- testimonies before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.012" offset="8515375">And what is also important is petitioner was doing all this under an alias.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.445" offset="8537109">He had the name "Bobbie London" and that is the basis of his dealings with this clearly disinterested outsider Crohn (ph) who sold them the cottage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.782" offset="8578487">Now, after that, that cottage was boarded up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.844" offset="8598758">It was specifically adduced in evidence that there were no other repairs at any moment made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.016" offset="8619447">Petitioner was not seen doing the actual physical day labor of boarding up that cottage.Pierro and another man, unidentified, did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.147" offset="8651943">But petitioner was seen there and if I may jump in the timescale a moment, just a couple of weeks in December of 1951, before the agents closed in, petitioner was one man who could get into that padlocked cottage where the -- where they later found some over 500 gallons of unstamped alcohol.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.704" offset="8734177">Now it -- it's not an improper --</text>

            <text syncTime="2174.818" offset="8802617">He did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.623" offset="8805857">He was seen doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.637" offset="8809932">That is outside testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.444" offset="8817142">It -- it is in our brief if you wish to reference right now, you can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.301" offset="8828531">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.780" offset="8834487">But we go beyond the bounds of saying that he was just a good friend when we -- when a -- an operation of this size from its references, possible potential informers or government witnesses to be sitting around, always present at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.799" offset="8898539">I want to go into the matter of two trucks, which were involved in this operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.886" offset="8918915">Petitioner and Pierro and here again on completely in this separate testimony of the agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.728" offset="8942320">They were seen to go to a parking lot and bought a Diamond T truck, false registry of the plates, petitioner was seen driving it a number of times, took it out by himself, gassed it up and when that -- when that truck was not sitting beside that garage storehouse, it was sitting across the street from petitioner's residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.948" offset="9023195">Now, a neighbor testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.935" offset="9031137">He was a man who worked nights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.809" offset="9038660">He said he would come by there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.165" offset="9043989">This was late in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.566" offset="9053602">At 2:30 in the morning, that truck would be gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.814" offset="9062588">The daytime, it'd be back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.501" offset="9073351">There was another truck, a Dodge truck which petitioner also was seen working on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.915" offset="9099055">And here again, this is upright eyewitness testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.952" offset="9115146">Petitioner was seen carrying with Margiasso some cartons for 5-gallon cans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.043" offset="9135522">All this alcohol was found in 5-gallon cans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.952" offset="9147225">Seen carrying those cartons from the Dodge truck into the -- into the Diamond T truck, and then they drove out to the garage with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.516" offset="9177422">Now, let me point out a little technicality lest I misrepresent the case even inadvertently, that the -- the agents obviously could not sit out in front of that place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.672" offset="9226010">They viewed from a distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.181" offset="9232071">One of their investigative practices was to drive by and in that quick glance they had to see what was going.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.457" offset="9261223">If they followed petitioner from his house to the garage they might trail him at a distance then drive by their place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.806" offset="9286614">That is all in the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.083" offset="9291734">I can't urge strongly enough that the -- that the Government brief's summary, which, of course, is longer than what I can say today, is still inadequate to give you the feeling of accuracy and detail that was before that jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.420" offset="9353070">Now, in this case, the agent testified that he saw them go up to the garage door, open the garage door, put some furniture in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.995" offset="9383372">May I make it clear that on that occasion, the agent had to run before he saw them actually putting those cartons into the garage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.669" offset="9422033">On the other hand, I don't think that detracts in the least, that they were handling those cartons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.864" offset="9438856">Of course, if petitioner had been disposed to bring in evidence of any legitimate use for those cartons, that will be one thing that cans were not found in the cartons necessarily, but they were engaged in a joint operation and that's the essence of conspiracy, an agreement which necessarily has to be evidenced by all that's seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.900" offset="9514924">So, we have here -- well, I -- I think that the -- that the petitioner's counsel is adverted to the fact that petitioner was seen there at the cottage and perhaps in the attempt to defend that and the only way that they did try, there is more eloquence and more effect on the jury than anything that could have happened in any other respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.223" offset="9608234">A neighbor testified to having seen petitioner at this garage premises and she's testified that -- that the woman that was living at those premises was a -- had introduced petitioner as a cousin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.832" offset="9682735">Petitioner then -- petitioner's counsel at the trial then called this woman back as their own witness and tried to adduce from her some testimony that maybe petitioner's business were, out there, was social.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.037" offset="9727561">Asked them -- asked this lady whether he was out there with the woman and the instant that the witness replied no-no, she was (Inaudible) dismissed and taken from the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.783" offset="9778552">And that is the only explanation or attempted explanation that any of these petitioners made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.684" offset="9802062">Now, as -- that there is a great deal of additional detail with respect to the nights in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.840" offset="9838738">I have observed in the brief, although not in today's argument there was nothing secretive because some of this was done in daylight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.586" offset="9865697">But there's something very substantial and secretive about boarding up the garage windows and that was so recognized in the trial because petitioner's attorneys tried to adduce from the neighbors a -- a danger of floods, a danger of children playing and so forth, all to -- to explain why these glass windows of the garage were boarded up.</text>

            <text syncTime="2941.709" offset="11870229">Yes, and I would defer the answer to that until the totality of the evidences before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.877" offset="11890918">I said at the outset, that what I've given the Court here is lamentably, skeletal depiction of what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.367" offset="11920802">What -- what has been added and what has just been read, it seems to me, is a repetition of the pattern, but no explanation or deviation from the pattern of any moment from those three clear occasions when that is exactly what he did and exactly what was testified to before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.279" offset="12000528">Now, there were occasions before and the jury no doubt could infer from the evidence before it, not even the confession.</text>

            <text syncTime="2992.106" offset="12071790">Whitley was there twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.606" offset="12077746">On -- on December 18, a Pontiac drove up which the agents identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.304" offset="12100629">They didn't see Whitley or identified him as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.843" offset="12114735">They got away on the night of -- of December 18, but that same Pontiac came back in the night of -- of the 28th.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.031" offset="12143470">At that time, Whitley was caught and from that, I would say that there were clearly before the jury two occasions in which it was a proper inference that that heavy loading of the car was exactly like -- was the other two occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.100" offset="12203760">I -- I don't want to be taken to minimize the fact that anything that you -- that is admitted against only one defendant may carry over a little, but the courts have got to keep going.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.066" offset="12259662">They can't have five trials for one trial and the defendants cannot have five trials when one trial would suffice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.996" offset="12291323">There is carry over and this Court has three times stated that that carry over, dangerous as it may be, is a proper -- that the -- that the trial judge does not abuse his discretion if he is very careful about seeing to it that the jury separates that evidence and doesn't apply it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.918" offset="12367078">Now in this case, there was no real problem of intermingling of the evidence and two or three defendant saying this you can -- you can carry over against defendant A, B, and C but not against D and E nothing of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.211" offset="12416188">There was one affidavit, one defendant, and the judge clearly told them, "Don't hold it against any of the rest."</text>

            <text syncTime="3090.339" offset="12464776">If the evidence is as clear as you think it is, that Paoli was a seller of the liquor, why didn't they charge him with being a seller along with the others that they did so charge?</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.128" offset="12519842">Why did they charge him only with the conspiracy?</text>

            <label>Mr. J. F. Bishop</label>
            <text syncTime="3107.874" offset="12534888">For these reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.950" offset="12539173">First, they did not charge the others as -- as sellers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.178" offset="12552129">The substantive counts were possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.880" offset="12562892">Now, the technicalities of actual possession by petitioner might not have been made out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.175" offset="12584103">In fact, he was clever enough to see to it that he didn't have possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.030" offset="12595493">He sent Margiasso out to fill up the cars and to bring them back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.985" offset="12611271">It's just for that purpose that Congress has enacted a conspiracy statute so that a person who takes one piece of a process can be caught.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.062" offset="12647633">I don't purport to know what was it, within the judgments of the prosecuting attorneys in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.456" offset="12673233">But I do say that these substantive accounts might well have failed as to actual possession or even a clear aiding and abetting of a possession by petitioner in this case, but he was definitely in the conspiracy whereby Margiasso got the possession, and where King got the possession and Whitley got the possession as to the actual handling of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.581" offset="12765706">He was the man who was always there.</text>
