            <label>Mr. Edmund E. Shepherd</label>
            <text syncTime="15.854" offset="166745">And at the same time to reanswer a question from Associate Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.930" offset="199137">Michigan has no record of legislative history for being possibly to tell just why that amendment was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.022" offset="259427">My guess would be and it's merely a guess or a suggestion that that additional phrase or clause was put in there because of the increase in juvenile delinquency of which we are all aware.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.634" offset="325883">Now if I might digress in the record just to give you an illustration of that, the other day just before I let -- I had occasioned to visit the State Police Post.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.159" offset="380008">And there for the first time I observed polygraph test of a young man 19 years of age, accused of statutory rape on a 13-year old girl.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.001" offset="435388">And I watched that and I observed his answers and he didn't confess, I understand he did live.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.168" offset="464018">But the horrible part of it was that at the same time six others were awaiting a similar test for statutory rape on the same 13-year old girl.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.323" offset="520652">So it maybe that acts of that kind induce the legislature to amend the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.816" offset="550640">Now, coming back to my answer to your question, Mr. Justice Brennan --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="117.310" stopTime="141.430">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="117.310" offset="572583">Well before you answer that one, Mr. Shepherd, I -- I wondered if -- if in passing this amendment, your legislature thought that perhaps it had to put another definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.109" offset="631829">It created another standard let's say or another type of obscenity in order to be able to convict people.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edmund_e_shepherd" startTime="141.430" stopTime="203.153">
            <label>Mr. Edmund E. Shepherd</label>
            <text syncTime="142.883" offset="674879">That might be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.849" offset="682820">Now, logically I passed to reanswering this other question.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.785" offset="710510">I do not think that under the -- the statute and in each particular case, you have to prove as a matter of fact that some particular youth, a boy or a man was led to commit some act of deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.430" offset="769128">I think that the -- the case, as a matter of fact, the issue of fact would be the matter contained in the book with the matter contained in the book tends to do these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.841" offset="830777">So that as in this case, the Recorder's Court judge resolved the issue of fact but finding as I view this record that taking the book as a whole and having read of it, it is obscene within this definition.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="203.153" stopTime="210.933">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="203.153" offset="915937">I understand from that that the State's position that there was a finding on the book as a whole.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edmund_e_shepherd" startTime="210.933" stopTime="499.937">
            <label>Mr. Edmund E. Shepherd</label>
            <text syncTime="210.933" offset="947075">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.016" offset="951463">That is definitely not the expensive maybe tedious.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.422" offset="965047">Just for a few minutes, I want to take you to this record and show you just why I -- I make that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.635" offset="997961">At the outset, a motion was filed to -- on -- on the face of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.006" offset="1019382">The motion is filed to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.093" offset="1031711">And on page 16 of the record there are some discussion about that in which the Recorder's judge reserves his decision on that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.245" offset="1072358">And he didn't pass upon it until the end of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.954" offset="1087195">Now, he says among other things in regard to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.740" offset="1114363">Now I would like first to meet on -- I would like first to meet with counsel because after all, some of these passages are delicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.250" offset="1148322">Some of these passages, I don't mind telling you, so far as I am only on page 123, referring to the book, and there are over 500 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.207" offset="1192208">And many continues I was pleased that the book was handed to me before the case commenced, which clearly indicates that at that time, when the motion was under consideration, he intended to read the whole book.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.209" offset="1252185">Now, the Court will turn to page 23, you will find that at that point in the case, during the receiving of testimony, these excerpts were introduced in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.018" offset="1331493">And what the Court said there clearly indicates that he did not intend to judge the book alone on those excerpts, because he says that the Court takes this position at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.545" offset="1373602">I have not read the complete book.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.585" offset="1385723">I intend to.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.299" offset="1396590">Now whether I base my decision on the complete book afterwards or the excerpts contained in there will be a matter of my opinion, or my opinion there.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.535" offset="1429504">So, he passes thereby and he introduces the excerpts solely for the purpose of identification, not that he may judge it but that he -- that they may, as he says, save a lot of time marking at the book and the page references, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.895" offset="1490944">Now on page 29, again he reserves the decision on the motion and clearly indicates that he is going to read this whole book and he says that he is just a slow reader, reads books very slowly or your excerpts very slowly or your briefs very slowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.116" offset="1595852">I do not -- I do not know that I have not completed reading anything but the brief and the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.930" offset="1619048">I have read part of the book and I've read part of these excerpts.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.640" offset="1633886">So he's progressing, maybe somewhat slowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.006" offset="1651440">Now on page 32, we come to the point where they are about to introduce expert testimony on the literary value of the book and whether or not this or rather by passages which earned the scrutiny here or essential to the theme.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.243" offset="1744332">And he clearly indicates that that is the purpose of the -- of admitting that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.566" offset="1777664">Now we turn to page 58 and 59 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.824" offset="1798666">Again on expert testimony and showing just how the Court's mind is working down at the bottom of the page for the whole report.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.087" offset="1831685">Without objecting any further, my ruling would be the same on both issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.908" offset="1847045">It would be perhaps the Court and the literary issue and go be of help to the Court and the interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.805" offset="1874631">I am going to permit people who claim to know what it's all about to testify in this case.That would apply to both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.570" offset="1901693">Now I want to point out just one thing here in passing.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.009" offset="1923427">Judge Ricker (ph) admitted in evidence and received in evidence testimony adduced from experts on literary values.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.965" offset="1967208">Experts who have read this entire book and who testified what if these episodes were essential to the main object or theme, he would not permit testimony as to whether in the opinion of any witness, the passages were obscene or the book was obscene because as he held right and wrong, (Inaudible) usurped is judicial function in passing on those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.788" offset="2094477">Now, on page 77 --</text>

            <text syncTime="762.934" offset="3155153">Now, I could refer through any number of page citations here but I turn to page 171 of the transcript of record in which the Court says however, the courts will permit it as I see it the testimony as to whether the material contained in there is of such literary value.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.042" offset="3251493">As to justify these particular passages, there might be immoral, nude, lascivious, and obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.310" offset="3276570">So I am going to ask you again (Inaudible), if you feel that some of the materials in there is justified by the literary value of the book, can you answer that?</text>

            <text syncTime="825.675" offset="3406033">You think that the literary value of the book would have been impaired at all by removing or changing some of those parts in the book.</text>

            <text syncTime="875.924" offset="3607071">And again on page 188, I hope I'm not too tedious, I think it's at the utmost importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.943" offset="3643120">Another witness on the stand, the Court says on the matter of obscenity nor salacious literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.303" offset="3676557">He has as I said received disqualifications and it goes to the degree rather than the admissibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.699" offset="3698186">So the Court will ask you, do you think that the passages could be eliminated, so rephrased without effect -- without affecting the literary value of the book.</text>
