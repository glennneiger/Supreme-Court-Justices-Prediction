            <text syncTime="17.360" offset="172805">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.129" offset="183881">I should like to add one item to the factual statement as outlined by counsel for petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.207" offset="220244">In 1954, following the Gold conviction, the Board issued in order to show cause as to why the union should not be decomplied.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.418" offset="269040">The union responded to that proceeding by electing Gold to a new term of office in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.891" offset="306970">Thereupon, the Board did issue its decompliance order, and following that, the proceedings in the Court of Appeals here for the District of Columbia initially in the District Court were undertaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.608" offset="361827">We submit that the basic question here presented was aptly summarized by the majority below in these words.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.011" offset="419401">What purports to be an affidavit is now merely a piece of paper evidencing false swearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.912" offset="446986">Certainly, this Court is not required to blindly accept the form and ignore the realities.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.853" offset="482826">Considering the basic congressional intent with reference to 9 (h) requirements, the non-Communist affidavits, we think the -- the wisdom and the soundness of the decision below is amply demonstrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.483" offset="553253">In the Highland Park case involving the basic question of non-Communist affidavits passed on here in 1951, this Court said this, "To grant benefits to a union, one of whose officers is an undenied Communist, certainly frustrates the congressional purpose to 'wholly' eradicate and bar from leadership in the American labor movement at each and every level adherence to the Communist Party and believers in the unconstitutional overthrow of our Government."</text>
            <text syncTime="147.876" offset="694836">Now, we take the position that the legislative history of the Act with particular reference to 9 (h) does not negate the power of the Board to decomply in circumstances such as are presented in this case or to put it another way, does not prevent the Board from protecting its processes from abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.328" offset="812701">The reference to Senator Taft's statement by counsel read in context, I think, relates to the threshold inquiry which both the Senate and the House bill initially contemplated.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.182" offset="892113">In other words, a requirement that in each instance the Board looked into the compliance status of the union before it might declare union incompliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.076" offset="943626">In conference, that requirement was eliminated and we submit that congressional thought on that subject is unrelated to the problem here presented which is one of protection of the Board's processes from abuse under related circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.018" offset="1015411">In 1953, a Senate subcommittee --</text>

            <text syncTime="239.793" offset="1062536">Initially, both the Senate and the House bill in 1947 would have required the Board in each instance to conduct the hearing and to determine whether or no, the -- the officers in fact were properly in compliance within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.084" offset="1135679">That requirement was deleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.017" offset="1143411">In place of it, was substituted this provision for the filing of an affidavit by the officers of the union with the -- with the compliance flowing therefrom if properly filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.221" offset="1200253">Significant in this connection is the fact that the --</text>

            <text syncTime="298.435" offset="1297115">Well, perhaps not, but I -- I don't think the fact that it was a different form of bill would make any difference, would it?</text>
            <text syncTime="306.434" offset="1329089">Because this was a question of how the compliance would be shown from the start.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.942" offset="1347166">It was said if they haven't been any compliance, reads like a false affidavit will be punished only by criminal proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="319.135" offset="1379871">But the statement did not go on to say that no other -- that no other results might derive therefrom.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.165" offset="1404008">I think the emphasis was on the criminal penalties in this field of labor management relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.986" offset="1427310">It seems to us that one of the reasons for writing it into the law was to make it abundantly clear to all who might file affidavits that involved here were criminal penalties quite apart from what else might be involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.374" offset="1488854">This matter was considered by a Senate subcommittee in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.241" offset="1508289">We deal with that subject at page 50 -- 39 of the Mine Mill brief which covers the basic problems that are here presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.280" offset="1548518">The thrust of that Senate subcommittee statement in 1953 was precisely the position that we're here contending for that of course the Board did have authority and power to protect its processes where a perjurious affidavit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.373" offset="1620825">To the same effect, was a statement by the Chairman of the Board before this same committee.</text>

            <text syncTime="1662.151" offset="6752005">But anyway, the -- the Act says no investigation shall be made by the Board of any question affecting commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.995" offset="6783352">The representation of employees raised by labor organizations under subsection (c), no petition under Section 9 (e) shall be unattained and no complaint shall be issued unless the affidavit and so forth is on file.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.000" offset="6847404">Now, the Section 10 of the Act provides that no -- no charge may be filed or entertained after the passage of six months from the occurrence of the events relied upon in the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.430" offset="6905083">Now, the -- when a charge is filed, the filing of the charge puts into operation the Board's machinery of making the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.681" offset="6942072">It says no investigation shall be made because when a charge is filed, the Board then investigates whether there is merit to the charge sufficient to justify the issuance of a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.080" offset="6987734">So without a -- the required affidavit on file or in this case, without something more than a scrap of paper evidencing false swearing, the Board was prohibited from even investigating the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.164" offset="7044054">Therefore, the 1950 affidavit is quite material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.050" offset="7059623">Now, it is important to remember that the events alleged as the basis of the unfair labor practice occurred in February of 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.240" offset="7100374">The first affidavit was filed in August 1950, so that was during the effective period of the 1950 affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.906" offset="7127019">Now, it is true that there were two or three minor amended charges filed, but the first two were filed during the period of the 1950 affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.489" offset="7177279">The other two amendments were filed after the elapse of the six-month statute of limitations for filing a charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.812" offset="7202670">So, for the last two charges to be considered at all, they had to be considered under the relating back theory and attached to it and become a part of the original charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.904" offset="7243003">Now, the original charge, therefore, was filed during the effective date of Gold's 1950 affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.876" offset="7270902">And if the Board was prohibited under 9 (h) from even investigating the merits of that charge, then of course, the -- there -- because there was no affidavit that court, we think, decides the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.952" offset="7331192">Now, the fact that the only effect as I see it of the 1951 affidavit is that there must also be on file an affidavit before a complaint can issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.736" offset="7378317">But in this case, before this case could properly be investigated and a complaint issued from the calendar standpoint, it was necessary for two affidavits to have been on file.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.091" offset="7423770">One, to effect or to put into operation the Board's investigative machinery, and since the Board's investigation took so long or for some other reason, it ran over until the next affidavit was required under the statute, there must be a second affidavit before the complaint could issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2207.960" offset="8935215">Now, the -- to get the history straight, the -- the Acts -- the affidavit was filed in 1950 in August.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.906" offset="8966980">The Acts alleged as the basis were -- occurred in February of 1951.</text>

            <text syncTime="2227.093" offset="9011702">And -- and one other point on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.223" offset="9020270">There is no claim in this record anywhere that the Board or that the union in anyway attempted to treat the 1951 affidavit as putting this in compliance when we were not in compliance in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.512" offset="9069380">There's nothing here to indicate that there was a change in compliance status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.406" offset="9089024">Now, as counsel has already pointed out, the union responded to their show-cause order by reelecting Gold president after he was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.997" offset="9127372">So, you're not imposing a penalty on a bunch of dukes, if I may use that expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.291" offset="9148583">They knew what was going on and he was reelected.</text>

            <text syncTime="2271.525" offset="9189439">Now, I'd like to touch briefly on one other point that I didn't think it was material but it's only, Justice Frankfurter asked counsel for the petitioner regarding the present status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.163" offset="9236041">The present status is not in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.400" offset="9248998">The employees -- first place, the Board ordered five employees, reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.858" offset="9266761">It didn't order 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.975" offset="9271254">It held that the respondent discharged 20, some odd employees justifiably, but five of them were out of seniority.</text>

            <text syncTime="2342.065" offset="9471666">If I might take just a moment, the Government restricted the use of hides at this period of the time and cut off this company's raw materials and that was the basis for a large reduction in force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.458" offset="9513253">And the Board has held in its order that that was the justifiable reduction but they didn't they agree with the matter in which it was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.082" offset="9539688">Now, if I may proceed just on one other point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.772" offset="9562467">We think that the Sixth Circuit's opinion and I -- we have to care for consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.597" offset="9581798">I didn't believe that I could improve on it by averting the Court with further brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.979" offset="9599248">It quotes from this Court's decisions, we think very effectively from the case of the Highland Park Manufacturing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.348" offset="9632789">And we think that the clear intent of Congress was, as this Court stated in that case, to wholly eradicate and bar from leadership in the American labor movement at each in every level adherence to the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.616" offset="9693811">Now, here is a union whose president files a false affidavit and he's reelected to office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.892" offset="9722964">He's indicted and reelected and he's convicted and he's again reelected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.660" offset="9738010">Certainly, the congressional purpose in the whole policy of labor-management relations could not be effectuated if this matter were to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.160" offset="9771969">Now, just to take a -- an illustration a little further, suppose that Mr. Gold had been indicted and had pleaded guilty to the charge, his conviction would be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.986" offset="9827349">Then suppose that the union reelects him to president -- to the office of president and suppose he goes right out and files another affidavit but at the time, he says it's false, but I'm in jail, I just will stay here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.025" offset="9871444">Certainly, the Board would not be bound to ignore the realities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.581" offset="9897671">Now, we have one other point that this action by the Sixth Circuit is not an administrative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.009" offset="9907388">This is an action by a branch of the judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.700" offset="9930167">And certainly, as that court so clearly pointed out in its opinion that it is not required to close its -- as to reality and even though the Board as an administrative agency may not have the authority to look into this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.387" offset="9988890">Certainty, a court when called upon to enforce the order, can apply ordinary judicial press codes and denial relief when these facts are in the record without dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.857" offset="10030791">Now, I would take the Board's position, if I may, one step further and state this, that while the Board is administrative in a lot of its functions, its judicial or at least quasi-judicial in many of its functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.565" offset="10077602">And from time in memorial, courts have inherently had power to protect their own processes from abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.746" offset="10106337">And we think that in exercising at least quasi-judicial actions, even the Board would be authorized to protect itself from what we would consider ridiculous abuse.</text>

            <text syncTime="2810.541" offset="11345586">Now, I think Section 9 (h) has been perhaps misread with regard to the crucial date, the jurisdictional purposes of the -- when the affidavits must be on file.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.297" offset="11404518">The first clause talks about no investigation being made but the -- no investigation means, no investigation concerning representation of employees under subsection (c) which means in the words of art of the statute that no election shall be held unless the union is in compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.139" offset="11503888">And with regard to unfair labor practices, no complaint shall be issued so that the critical date for purposes of compliance is the date when the complaint -- the Board complaint issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.287" offset="11564492">And the investigation to which Mr. Harwood referred was an investigation concerning representatives ID and election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.818" offset="11622693">The Board's argument rests entirely on the position as I understand it that there is nothing which negates the Board's power to decomply a union because of the falsity of the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.680" offset="11690088">But nothing has been pointed out to this Court to support that power to vest -- to visit such drastic consequences upon the union and such destruction of labor relation with the one exception of the 1953 Subcommittee Report of the Senate Committee on labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.276" offset="11784443">Now, that Subcommittee Report is not, by definition, part of the legislative history and all that that report amounts to was an expression of opinion by the subcommittee when they had heard of the decision of the Court of Appeals in our case that they sought the Court of Appeals withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.662" offset="11858004">Now, this was certainly a trespass why the subcommittee on the function of the -- on the judicial function with regard to interpreting Section 9 (h).</text>

            <text syncTime="3110.746" offset="12546382">Yes, but you might be required to consider it only if you find that the Board does have a power to decomply for false affidavit that it -- that it may do so pending appeal and not a res judicata that that the Sixth Circuit -- that the Board was entitled or able to -- to escape the Sixth Circuit's injunction by going out to the -- the Court of Appeals, the District of Columbia's injunction by going out to the Sixth Circuit and inviting that Court to be whether of the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.638" offset="12661948">I have just one point I should like to make with regard to the question that was put by Mr. Justice Reed to Mr. Kammholz -- when this -- the question with regard to what is the Board to do to determine compliance initially?</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.395" offset="12720985">When the legislation was first before the Congress in 1947, the Bill as passed said -- made the fact of membership in the Communist Party, the test of compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.316" offset="12764662">The statute 3021, -- H.R. 3021 said that no union which has Communist as officers -- Communist Party members as officers shall be in compliant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.595" offset="12805726">That was debated on a floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.813" offset="12810637">Senator Ferguson said, “How -- how was the Board going to get involved in whether or not an officer of the union is a -- is a member of the Communist Party?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.301" offset="12836551">And Senator McClellan said, “Well, they would do that if allegations came to their attention that he was a Communist and they would want a hearing on it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.971" offset="12879287">That did not satisfy the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.028" offset="12887437">That is precisely what they wanted to get away from to have these hearings by the Board with regard to whether John Doe, an officer of the union was a member of the Communist Party and that's where the Conference Committee came up with it solutions to this problem, had him file an affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.100" offset="12955773">If the affidavit is false, you'll go to jail but the union is in compliance.</text>
