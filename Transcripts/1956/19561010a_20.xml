            <text syncTime="51.781" offset="310523">We filed this motion because we felt that it was the duty of the Department and the Government to this Court as a lawyer before this bar and also as a prosecutor.</text>

            <text syncTime="115.027" offset="563493">I will tell the Court as to how it developed in the Department and what our problems were with regard to the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.116" offset="607796">The first item was the one of June 18th, 1953 in regard to the testimony before the Senate Committee concerning Senator McCarthy, a plot against him, and the -- Mr. Bortz and his statements before a Communist meeting in regard to handling of firearms and the construction of bombs.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.403" offset="708942">That matter was developed during the trial in an interrogation of the jurors to determine the effect that it had upon for this -- this witness to appear before the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.364" offset="760874">It was gone into at some length by the Court and the Court appeared to be satisfied that it did not affect the trial of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.040" offset="803506">Then, we have the further incident --</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="189.542" offset="861497">The problem in regard to that was that when the witness, Bortz, appeared before the Committee, he stated that if he truthfully answered the questions that the Committee asked him in regard to the testimony of Mr. Mazzei before the Committee, that it would incriminate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.291" offset="936521">So, he had on the one hand that -- the statements that raised the real problem for us as to their validity before the Committee and we had the statement of the person who was involved, Mr. Bortz, saying that any truthful answer of those questions would incriminate on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.706" offset="1026173">And we had the question then if whether or not that testimony, being known to the Court and the jurors, having been interrogated about would be such that it should reach back to the testimony of Mr. Mazzei in this case about the connection of the various defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.551" offset="1225540">But the Court did inquire into them with the jurors in this case to see if it had any effect and knew of them and examined the case in regard to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.402" offset="1356988">Well, I believe he would, although I don't think at that time, the Department doubted the veracity of Mr. Mazzei in that particular testimony because it had the testimony of Mr. Mazzei before the Committee under oath and the -- the witness involved raising a doubt as to which one could have been right.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.050" offset="1443610">And the statements were as to what Mr. Bortz told Mr. Mazzei rather than what actually happened, except as to the instant of the Communist Party meeting and the demonstration of firearms and bombs.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.364" offset="1500871">So, it was -- in an area, it was very difficult to prove who was correct.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank J. Donner</label>
            <text syncTime="2499.633" offset="10101948">I'd better start by summarizing the items of testimony for which this witness was responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.451" offset="10145207">There are five in number.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.435" offset="10157119">Three of them are private conversations and two deal with teaching in school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.081" offset="10191705">The conversations which involved teaching in school -- the testimony which involves teaching in school attributes to the petitioners Dolsen and Careathers' statements involving force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.606" offset="10277804">Then the witness said that these two petitioners thought that the witness was insufficiently instructed in Marxism-Leninism and required some private tutoring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.053" offset="10339558">And so he said they went to him privately and again told him that the only way that we can achieve a revolution is by force and violence and with the aid of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.349" offset="10392743">And curiously enough, the things that he testified, they said to him privately, not only deal with force and violence or are almost in the same language, that is force and violence and with the aid of the Communist Party, as he says was used in the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.219" offset="10480201">In addition to that, there is another private conversation with the petitioner, Dolsen, along the same lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.226" offset="10512280">Now, this is the -- the evidence with respect to the private conversation, obviously could not have been contradicted by anyone or a petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.879" offset="10554911">In addition to that -- and here, I'm forced to disagree with the Solicitor General, he testified about a school, but he didn't identify a single student in that school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.851" offset="10610813">For all that could have happened, that never -- that never could have been said and the defendants could never have brought anyone to contradict it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.092" offset="10643728">There is not a syllable in this record to identify any one student in this school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.224" offset="10668283">And so first, it is not a fact that the evidence with respect to the teaching in the school was corroborated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.458" offset="10713213">There was no other witness who testified about teaching in the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.034" offset="10731499">And second, the defendants could not have refuted it because no one who heard the conversation, no one who heard the teaching was identified by name so that he could have been subpoenaed and brought into court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.666" offset="10786043">So you have these statements, all of them, in isolation, all of them made under circumstances in which the defendants could not have refuted them, all of them dealing with force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.324" offset="10844662">And the two dealing with the schools being the only statements in the record dealing with what in fact was taught and advocated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.337" offset="10880711">Now, that --</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="2694.496" offset="10881337">May I -- may I suggest that it will help me if you would state what's the defendant's position with reference to the motion.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_j_donner" startTime="2701.225" stopTime="2836.034">
            <label>Mr. Frank J. Donner</label>
            <text syncTime="2701.225" offset="10908296">Very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.372" offset="10912893">It seems to me that this motion involves two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.729" offset="10934314">First, the question as to what is the appropriate legal procedure in connection with the motion, and second, whether the Court should retain jurisdiction over the case, and here, the other issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.355" offset="11008815">That is the issues that are presented by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.788" offset="11022503">Now, with -- with respect to the first, we contend that it would be appropriate on this record for the Court to order the dismissal of the two defendants, the two petitioners as to whom there is only this evidence which is now tainted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.957" offset="11095228">And second, that as to the remainder that in order a remand for a new trial because there is no question here that you have a situation like the SACB situation, a Communist Party case, in which the collateral perjury, the collateral falsities of a witness discredit -- inevitably discredit his testimony in the principal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.579" offset="11209644">And -- since in fact the testimony was admitted against all of the defendants, over -- over the defendant's protest, so that there isn't anything for a District Court to do but to decide an issue of credibility which is for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.252" offset="11276413">Once it's recognized that in these collateral proceedings of this witness showed himself to be an unreliable witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.222" offset="11312253">In this posture, a District Court could only decide the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.959" offset="11331166">He could only say, “Well, I agree with the Government that he was -- he was an unreliable witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.499" offset="11353318">The record is tainted and therefore, a new trial should be ordered.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.575" offset="11365648">Of course, there's no question that the evidence was material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.618" offset="11377873">They all dealt with force and violence and most of it dealt with teaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.719" offset="11394278">So that on this record, I repeat that the appropriate procedure would be, first, to dismiss as to the two, and second, to remand this to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.049" offset="11435551">Now, I -- I too feel --</text>

            <text syncTime="2839.368" offset="11460838">Order of judgment of acquittal as to the two, Your Honor, because that's the only evidence asked to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.767" offset="11478392">There is no other evidence.</text>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="2848.129" offset="11495842">For the same -- the same remand do you mean?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_j_donner" startTime="2851.034" stopTime="3148.984">
            <label>Mr. Frank J. Donner</label>
            <text syncTime="2851.034" offset="11507545">For a new trial as to the other three.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.020" offset="11527502">Because as to Dolsen and Careathers, the principle evidence against them are these private conversations which this man testified to contemporaneously with his testimony before the Senate Subcommittee about Senator McCarthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.923" offset="11603048">Now, bear in mind that in 1953, this man had been an agent for the FBI for 11 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.606" offset="11641814">He testified that he -- that he had made a room-full of reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.056" offset="11667623">The FBI knew everything that he was on a position to report about the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.627" offset="11693850">So it can hardly be said that the Government was completely in ignorance of the possible lack of credibility of this witness when a man is working for any employer for 11 years in one field and he doesn't tell them that the Communist Party had a shooting practice, that it practiced manufacturing bombs, that it had a rifle range in a home, that it took pictures of the City of Pittsburg and staged, mocked sabotage raids.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.798" offset="11838568">Why, that was precisely what the FBI employed him to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.790" offset="11854555">And to suggest that there could be any doubt that this was an invention, it seems to me is rather extreme under the circumstances of his relationship to the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.236" offset="11908368">And it -- it does not involve merely the question of Bortz.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.444" offset="11929161">Bortz was one individual who was mentioned in the testimony as the alleged finger man for Senator McCarthy, but their huge plot was laid out involving, for example, petitioner Dolsen who presided at the meeting where plans were made so that the fact that Bortz pleaded the Fifth Amendment, horribly explains the Government's satisfaction with that testimony because as I say, it covered far more than Bortz.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.735" offset="12058311">Now, I also want to point out to the Court that this testimony, and the Solicitor has pointed it out in his motion, that the Court of Appeals referred to this testimony not once but twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.008" offset="12175444">Once, in connection with a discussion of the sufficiency of the evidence, and another occasion, in connection with a discussion of the admissibility of the evidence.So that there is no question that the evidence loomed large in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.727" offset="12246288">There were only five witnesses and this -- this witness testified about in his conclusory way about force and violence in such a way that he couldn't have failed to impress both the Court and the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.886" offset="12314937">It seems to me that you could -- the testimony is only 54 pages long.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.015" offset="12331447">The Court can read it and you can't help reading it but what -- but what -- but inevitably come to the conclusion that this witness made the case for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.300" offset="12376586">He was the force and violence man.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.469" offset="12385259">He was the person who talked about shedding blood and -- without equivocation on this bare-faced conclusory kind of -- of statements which informers are told to give.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.162" offset="12432071">And so Your Honor, it seems to me that to prove now whether there was some psychiatric barrier which possibly separated the testimony in the trial court from everything that went afterwards, seems to me to be rather irrational if I may say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.657" offset="12522036">It seems to me that when you have this man who was contemporaneously lying, he gets off a stand in this case and then he gets on the Senate Committee and he says, "The -- the Communist had this huge plot."</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.970" offset="12571251">He -- if he was psychiatric, he must have suffered from a form of schizophrenia or divided personality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.361" offset="12596851">But nevertheless, it seems to me, viewing this thing in an ordinary common sense rational way, it's quite obvious that the petitioners here were the victims of a perjurer, a man who lied and lied boldly and without much skill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.414" offset="12669053">And so -- and -- and this is particularly true of course with respect to the two petitioners as to whom there is no other evidence.</text>

            <label>Justice Harold Burton</label>
            <text syncTime="3148.984" offset="12699355">Mr. Donner, you are also going to refer to the other facet of this motion as to whether or not you should argue the merits of the main case?</text>

            <text syncTime="3156.842" offset="12730702">I'm sorry, Your Honor, I'll do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.084" offset="12739688">I'm glad you reminded me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.813" offset="12754631">The question of whether the Court should hear the whole case in order to determine these other issues really involves values that don't impinge on petitioner so much as they do on the business and function of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.758" offset="12822444">Now, we have presented a number of questions.I'll just list them briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.304" offset="12844596">And we have presented questions about the admissibility of the evidence, whether a pre-1940, pre-statutory evidence is admissible, whether the evidence antedating the indictment is admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.033" offset="12899453">We have presented questions about the comments on clear and present danger which the Court -- the trial court engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.284" offset="12928502">We have presented questions about the conduct of -- of the voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.350" offset="12948773">Now, there have been, as the Court knows, 14 Smith Act cases tried, and they -- these cases produced characteristic and predictable kinds of problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.044" offset="12995584">And one of the most characteristic is the admissibility of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.471" offset="13013243">That's fought out in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.228" offset="13024319">And it seems to me that -- that the Court has a duty to tell the District Courts of this country what the rules are in Smith Act case about the admissibility of evidence because -- otherwise, regard to have the same kind of confusion and conflict which it seems to me should be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.158" offset="13104044">In every case for example, the Government has a witness named John Lautner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.508" offset="13121390">He testifies about what he taught in a school in 1930.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.334" offset="13140720">The defendants object.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.682" offset="13150124">Well, importantly to say their testimony is competent or it's incompetent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.766" offset="13166425">It's remote or not to remote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.233" offset="13180322">But in every Smith Act case, John Lautner has testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.355" offset="13196831">Now, it seems to me that this Court must sometimes say whether that testimony is admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.126" offset="13219924">That question is one which will continue to play the administration of the statute in this field until this Court speaks with some authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.801" offset="13254614">And that troubles us and I'm sure that it troubles everybody who is going to try one of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.726" offset="13278229">Now, another kind of problem, "Are you entitled to a hearing on clear and present danger or aren't you?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.379" offset="13304874">Three District Courts -- two District Courts have now given hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.313" offset="13320652">All the rest say that what was held -- that was held in Dennis that you're not entitled to a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.410" offset="13344998">Another recurrent problem, there's a universal national feeling against Communism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.260" offset="13368404">The climate is awful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.400" offset="13373001">It's hard to get a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.511" offset="13381465">What are the trial judges' duties with respect to the conduct of the voir dire?</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.231" offset="13404348">Does he have a special responsibility to cure the prejudice in a hostility?</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.642" offset="13421902">How far must he go?</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.658" offset="13430053">That -- those kinds of questions, it seemed to me, which are polished by our case, have to be resolved sometime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.656" offset="13457951">Now, I don't want to put myself in a position of saying that I'd rather have my day in court today rather in sometime in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.238" offset="13496299">But I do feel it's my duty to remind the Court that you do have these problems, and I think the Court can solve them as expeditiously and as quickly as possible.</text>
