            <text syncTime="24.062" offset="199659">This is a direct appeal from an order of the District Court of the Southern District of Florida dismissing an information which was brought under Title 16, Section 852, commonly known as the Black Bass Act, although that statute now applies to all fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.897" offset="286908">The information set forth on pages 1 and 2 of the record charged that when Ludenia Howard trading as the Stokes Fish Company delivered to the Railway Express Agency in the State of Florida for transportation to the State of Georgia, 150 pounds of freshwater bream, freshwater crappie and freshwater black bass.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.308" offset="396622">And that such transportation was then contrary to the laws of the State of Florida and in violations of the Black Bass Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.640" offset="437896">The Black Bass Act, set forth at page 39 of the Government's brief, provides that it should be unlawful for any person to deliver for transportation from one State to another any black bass or other fish if such transportation is contrary to -- to the law of the State from which the black bass or other fish is or is to be transported.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.749" offset="554402">The defendant moved in the lower court to dismiss the information on the grounds that it failed to state the cause of action and this motion was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.907" offset="599019">The order dismissing the information appears on page 3 of the record and the judge there said that the only prohibition against the out-of-state transportation of the fish, set forth in the information, was found in the regulations of the Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission of the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.081" offset="691702">And being of the opinion that the rules and regulations of this Commission do not constitute the law of Florida as described by and contemplated by the Black Bass Act, the information was dismissed.</text>

            <text syncTime="168.229" offset="776338">As this was a decision dismissing an information based on the construction of the statute upon which the information was founded, the Government took a direct appeal and this Court noted probable jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.059" offset="851571">We -- we look then at the outset to the status of these rules and regulations as they exist in the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.183" offset="884067">In the 1942, general election, Florida amended its constitution by enacting Article IV, Section 30, set forth at page 43 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.584" offset="941746">This constitutional amendment created the fresh water fish commissions and conferred upon it, the power to regulate the manner and method of taking, transporting, storing and using fresh water fish among other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.218" offset="1016247">It was also provided in this constitutional amendment, Section 7 on page 44 of the Government's brief that the legislature may enact any laws in the aid of but not inconsistent with the provisions of this amendment and all existing laws inconsistent herewith shall no longer remain in force and effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.176" offset="1108093">All laws fixing penalties for the violation of the provisions of this amendment --</text>

            <text syncTime="273.268" offset="1196492">In other words, Florida by constitutional amendment vested in this Commission supreme authority over the regulation of fresh water fish and left to the legislature only the power to act -- to enact consistent laws and laws fixing penalties and license taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.781" offset="1298474">The Florida Game Commission pursuant to this constitutional authority enacted a rule, Rule 1401, cited at page 48 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.090" offset="1355734">And that rule provided that no person should transport out of the State Florida any black bass, bringing some fish and other enumerated fishes.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.133" offset="1423862">The Florida legislature enacted Section 372.83, cited at page 46 of the Government's brief, and that statute provides that any person who violates any rule or regulation of the Commission adopted pursuant to the constitutional amendment shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.699" offset="1514141">Therefore, there existed in Florida at the time of the alleged defense, a rule promulgated by the Commission acting pursuant to constitutional authority prohibiting this transportation and a Florida statute enacted by the legislature providing that any violation of that rule would be a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.017" offset="1607450">There is no question in this case as to the validity of the rules or regulations in the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.311" offset="1640573">The Florida Supreme Court has held that they have the effect of law in that State and indeed, appellee concedes this.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.190" offset="1676100">On page 12 of appellee's brief, the following language appears.We frankly and fully concede that the Florida Commission is a legally constituted commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.925" offset="1727091">We also concede without argument that its rules are enforced in the State of Florida so long as these rules are within the scope of the amendment creating it, and I may state parenthetically, there is no question here but the rules are within the scope of the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.033" offset="1795532">For this purpose, appellee concedes.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.872" offset="1806817">In the State of Florida, they are given the force and effect of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.632" offset="1825938">However, this does not make them the law of Florida as contemplated by the Black Bass Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.759" offset="1850389">It is with this last statement the Government takes issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.210" offset="1864182">For it is the Government's position that when Congress in the Black Bass Act said contrary to the law of any State, it meant contrary to such law as that State should probably consider binding upon its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.791" offset="1922487">Since there is no question but the Florida considers these rules and regulations valid and enforces them, there's no question but that they should be the laws of the State within the meaning of the Black Bass Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.738" offset="1982360">The Black Bass Act was originally enacted in 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.969" offset="2007228">Prior to that time, this Court had on many occasions construed phrases such as state statute, more restrictive phrases than law of the State to include administrate regulations as well as states statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="514.457" offset="2161246">At the bottom of page 13, it says even if the rules and regulations of a Commission under some conditions could be the law of a State, it does not follow that these are the laws applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.989" offset="2199280">We take position that they are not the law applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="543.633" offset="2277857">The -- nothing in the legislative history of the Black Bass Act indicates that it was intended to apply only to administrative regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.010" offset="2323414">Indeed, in the Senate bill, accompanying the 1947 amendments of the Black Bass Act cited that, at the bottom page of 29 and 30 of the Government's brief, it is said that if we are protecting fish, an important natural resource, the Federal Government must collaborate in the enforcement of protective laws and regulations at the point where state jurisdiction ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.973" offset="2455280">And it must also be remembered that we are acting here in the context of conservation, an area in which both the Federal Government and the States, have traditionally proceeded through administrative regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.055" offset="2515571">Indeed, this is recognized in other provisions of Title 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.599" offset="2545768">Thus, in Section 669 of Title 16, cited at pages 24 and 25 of the Government's brief, it is provided that the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to cooperate with the States through their respective State Fish and Game Departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.941" offset="2619120">And then skipping, it says, “But no money apportioned under said sections to any State shall be expended therein until its legislature or other state agency authorized by the state constitution to make laws governing the conservation of wildlife shall have assented to the provisions of said sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.179" offset="2708041">Congress there specifically has recognized that state agencies may be authorized by the state constitution to enact laws governing conservation and then --</text>

            <text syncTime="684.583" offset="2841684">With respect to the local nature of some regulations, indeed, before the constitutional amendment was passed, that's precisely what the state legislature did.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.570" offset="2885674">So, there's no inherent difference between the regulations of the Commission and the -- and the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.469" offset="2925275">In Sylvester against Tindall, cited at page 19 of the Government's brief, the Florida Supreme Court reviewed the past history of conservation and legislation in that State and noted that -- that for many years, the legislature had tried in vain to adequately deal with the subject matter of this amendment by local or special acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.363" offset="3036871">And -- and so we feel that that distinction is without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.460" offset="3053171">With respect to the changeable nature of these regulations, I might say that it has been the law of Florida consistently since 1927 that out-of-state transportation of black bass was illegal, besides which the Florida Legislature has provided rules for the promulgation of the Commission's regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1311.295" offset="5348603">I might say that at the outset here that if Ludenia Howard, a citizen of the State of Florida had known that she was to be charged on a game or on a fish violation case and that then mind of the United States Governor -- Governor would put her in this Supreme Court prior to a time that her innocence whereas was still presumed to be there and before she had been convicted, I dare say gentlemen, that she would have been much better off had she been not guilty but plead guilty in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.935" offset="5475140">And I say that advisedly and very sincerely, and I say it for this reason, that all of us know that more and more today that administrative agencies and commissioners are governing our very lives and it's very important that when we consider the rules and regulations that are made with these agencies and the statutes that are passed by the Congress in a criminal nature that our individual citizens do not -- do not -- not -- do not lose their liberty through actions of these boards and commissions to an insidious process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1391.077" offset="5667715">We don't contend in any respect that the rules and regulations of the Game and Fish Commission of Florida are not enforceable in Florida if they were within the scope of the constitutional amendment was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.769" offset="5726438">But we do say, and very sincere to this Court, that even though that rule is enforceable in Florida, it was not within the contemplation of the Black Bass Act which was passed in 1926 that those rules and regulations should be the law of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.292" offset="5792580">And I think one reason is very obvious on the face of it and that is in 1926, when that Black Bass Act was passed which prohibited the transportation of black bass within the States or without the States, if it was against the law of that State, that the constitutional amendment creating the game and fish -- Fresh Water Fish Commission in Florida did not come into being until some 20 years later, almost 20 years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.735" offset="5898324">So, I think it's observed on the face of it to say that Congress meant at that time that the law of authority was going to apply to the rules and regulations that came into effect in the State of Florida almost 20 years later.</text>

            <text syncTime="1492.252" offset="6072404">And that is they say that that Black Bass Act has been amended twice, since its inception in 1926 for the very fact that when that Act was -- was amended that the Congress did not change the wording with respect to the law of the State is the best evidence that the Congress did not even consider the rules and regulations of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.470" offset="6153279">And the only amendments that took part in that -- in that Black Bass Act was to name different types of fish other than black bass upon which it's illegal to transport back and forth.We seriously contend, Your Honors, that the main difference that the Government and Ludenia Howard in this case is the fact that the Government refused to believe that this is a criminal statute and it affects the liberty of our citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.829" offset="6270725">And add as a criminal statute as this Court has held many times, the statute must be strictly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.116" offset="6299878">If there's any ambiguity in the statute, that ambiguity must be resolved in favor of the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.710" offset="6326209">If the statute is perceptible of two interpretations on a criminal basis, the interpretation which favors the accused must be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.739" offset="6366333">There can be no steps, there can be no constructive federal offenses, no constructive offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.174" offset="6404054">And we believe, Your Honors, that when we read into that Black Bass Act today, that was passed in 1926, that it implied to the rules and regulations of the Game Commission which came in many years later that we thereby make a constructive offense which this Court from time immemorial says we cannot do any criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.206" offset="6508231">I would like to address my remarks a little bit to the little pamphlet here which the Government has seen fit to introduce before this Court in its brief and that's called the Wildlife Code of the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.874" offset="6574895">Now, actually we're not here falling with the Game and Fish Commission of Florida, but I think that we -- we're only falling with a little bit with respect to a federal criminal -- criminal action attaching to any arbitrary rule that that Board of four or five members might -- might pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.563" offset="6657651">Now, it's impossible to codify the rules and regulations of this Game and Fish Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.804" offset="6686595">For example, our legislature meets every two years and -- and the laws of -- that are passed without legislature become the laws of the State and they are -- they are codified by the Secretary of State of Florida statutes and then those laws are published by the West Publishing Company and Harrison Publishing Company as Florida statutes annotated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.242" offset="6764335">Because of the nature of these rules and the changeableness of these rules, it is impossible to codify with our statutes in a rule of this fresh and game fish -- Fish Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.872" offset="6814908">And I submit, Your Honor, that that was not the intention of the Congress when it gave it -- gave that power to the -- when it talked about the law of the State that it did not consider that a citizen or a -- a board of three or four citizens could automatically invoke the long arm of the Federal Government because of some arbitrary change in rule that that Commission makes which are not codified among our statutes in which it cannot be codified among our statutes.</text>
