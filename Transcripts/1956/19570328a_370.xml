            <label>Mr. Stephen Ailes</label>
            <text syncTime="39.670" offset="262040">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.798" offset="274578">This is a Federal Employers' Liability Act case here on certiorari from the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.560" offset="305612">The issue in the case is a question of whether or not the Safety Appliance Act applies to maintenance-of-way vehicles used on the railroads such as the two which are pictured with our brief, motor track car and a push truck which appear on last two pages of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.905" offset="406967">Specifically, the issue is the question of whether or not these vehicles constituting a train when hits together or whether the motor track car on which the workmen are riding constitutes a locomotive engine as those terms are used in the Safety Appliance Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.861" offset="510830">A question is also involved whether or not the push truck which appears on the second page is a locomotive, tender, car, or a similar vehicle as that -- as those terms are used in Section 8 of the Safety Appliance Act, so as to require an efficient handbrake under Section 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.578" offset="605706">This was a personal injury case of course in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.133" offset="627858">The respondent had been driving a vehicle of this character with two other or three other workmen on it, pulling a push truck returning from a place out near Washington Grove in Maryland where they had been working on a specific day.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.929" offset="699120">As they came through a station, a dog ran in front of the motor-car.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.403" offset="725034">A break was applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.939" offset="731094">The car skidded in and hit the dog and overturned and the respondent was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.484" offset="761292">Now, negligence was alleged, first on the common law of ground that the railroad should not have permitted the respondent to be out on a rainy day pulling a push truck with no more brakes than the brakes which were on the motor track car.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.215" offset="844257">But a second ground was alleged to wit that the Safety Appliance Act had been violated because of the fact that there was no handbrake on the push truck, that four-wheel flat car that they were towing, and because of the second fact that no train brake was provided by which the section foreman when he drove the motor track car could apply brakes on the car which he was towing.</text>

          <turn speaker="stephen_ailes" startTime="221.052" stopTime="598.730">
            <label>Mr. Stephen Ailes</label>
            <text syncTime="221.052" offset="987617">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.003" offset="991378">Under the Act, they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.413" offset="1005066">Now, the lower court instructed the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.448" offset="1025128">Now, the other ground of recovery is based upon an Act of Congress known as the Safety Appliance Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.206" offset="1048221">Congress has required railroads to furnish certain equipment for use of the operation of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.512" offset="1073403">Among those that are necessary as in this particular case was that the law required the railroad to have handbrakes on this truck and to have brakes on the motor-car controlling the brakes on both the truck and the motor-car.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.993" offset="1131395">The evidence clearly showed and it is admitted -- it is admitted that this equipment was not furnished.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.423" offset="1157099">And you will find therefore that if by reason of the failure to apprise that equipment, this accident happened then that was the -- that that was the proximate cause or contributing cause of the accident, then the railroad of course is liable to the plaintiff and no negligence on the part of the plaintiff himself as to bar to his right of recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.050" offset="1251558">Now, a verdict followed for the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.021" offset="1275486">The case of course, this instruction went in over the objection of the -- of petitioner here, motions for a new trial on the ground of the Safety Appliance Act should have been excluded from the case were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.933" offset="1327104">The case was reviewed on appeal by the Court of Appeals here in the District of Columbia and the lower court was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.974" offset="1355316">We sought certiorari here because for 64 years, since the passage of the Safety Appliance Act, the railroads and the Interstate Commerce Commission have taken it absolutely for granted that the Safety Appliance Act does not apply to the small maintenance-of-way vehicles which railroads used to haul workmen and tools to and from stations to the place of work along the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.978" offset="1467329">We sought certiorari because 60,000 or more of these motor track cars were in use today and a countless number of push trucks are in use today, none of which are equipped with power brakes which Section 1 of the Safety Appliance Act requires for train brakes meeting a system by which the lead or power driven car can apply brakes on the other vehicles with automatic couplers which the Safety Appliance Act also requires with grab irons and handholds and draw-bars, 31 inches from the ground with sill steps or with handbrakes on the push truck, all of which would be required as the Safety Appliance Act applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.100" offset="1663770">Now, if the lower court decision stands and it's correct, those changes must be made even though it maybe wholly impractical to do so, and even though it may actually increase hazards as distinguished from removing them because these vehicles as the record show must be removed from the tracks by the crew, the section crew that takes them out at the place where -- where they work, and they must be removed in a hurry if a regular train -- if they happen to meet a regular train travelling along the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.333" offset="1824684">Now, it is our position that the Safety Appliance Act in terms does not apply to these vehicles and was never intended to.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.426" offset="1873063">These vehicles are not trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.714" offset="1886229">These vehicles are not used in train service.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.425" offset="1901066">They are not used to carry commercial passengers or freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.429" offset="1917053">They are not operated by trainmen and railroad partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.846" offset="1930742">They are operated by maintenance-of-way personnel who have a separate brotherhood, the brotherhood of maintenance-of-way employees, and they've had that brotherhood since 1887.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.761" offset="1978389">The language of the Act clearly applies to trains and refers to trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.391" offset="2016946">Section 1 use these terms in imposing the requirements that a power brake be used on the locomotive and that a train brake system be used in a train.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.146" offset="2055920">It uses terms like locomotive engine, train-brake system, train, engineer, refers to a locomotive's drawing of train.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.449" offset="2097194">It talks about brakemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.734" offset="2106284">It talks about the common handbrake which is common on a freight car but not on a type of vehicle pulled here.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.994" offset="2139303">Section 3 of the original Act tells a railroad that it may refuse to receive cars from another connecting carrier or from shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.131" offset="2183920">If those cars are not equipped with the necessary devices, of course, these maintenance-of-way vehicles are not exchanged between railroad as ordinary freight cars are.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.361" offset="2224776">Section 8 defines the coverage of this Act in terms of trains, locomotives, tenders, cars and similar vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.953" offset="2271169">Now, the respondent argues that these are cars and since they are cars, and so clearly cars that it is useless, in fact improper to refer to the legislative history in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.358" offset="2324773">We say first of all, it's perfectly apparent from the words used in the Act that the Act is designed to refer -- to refer to trains and train equipment and when it says cars, it means train cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.216" offset="2376286">But in any event, we understand why the respondent does not wish the Court to refer to the legislative history for the Act, because nothing could be clearer when you see the legislative history that Congress had no intention whatsoever of referring -- requiring this equipment on anything but train equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.088" offset="2467715">Here is how the legislation came about in the fist place.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.617" offset="2489866">In 1889 to 1893 --</text>

            <text syncTime="989.392" offset="4060975">As I said in 1889 and 1893, there was considerable agitation for legislation to solve two serious problems that existed on the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.513" offset="4101413">One was that a great many brakemen were being killed by being thrown from the top of cars where they had to go in order to set the handbrakes by which freight cars were stopped in those days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.519" offset="4153448">The second was that a great many trainmen were being killed and injured by being mashed between two cars when they start to go between the car's coupler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.503" offset="4197334">As in railroad (Inaudible) sometimes the deadwood didn't meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.396" offset="4213008">That meant that couplers, whatever kind of coupler it was failed to connect in the two cars would smash together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.395" offset="4244982">All of the -- well, let me say this, an Association of Railroad Commissioners throughout the State petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission and so that the Brotherhoods for action on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.926" offset="4291062">All the references are to the freight cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.237" offset="4304332">Section 1 of the Safety Appliance Act with Section 3 solved problem number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.317" offset="4336619">It required the air brake systems which got the brakeman off to the top of the cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.207" offset="4360234">Section 2 and Section 4 and 5 solved problem number two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.719" offset="4382281">It required automatic couplers which coupled on impact so that no one had to go between the cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.879" offset="4414882">But we of course point out that these problems have nothing whatsoever to do with the kind of equipment which is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.193" offset="4452185">There isn't any way a brakeman can be riding on top of a car such as our push truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.214" offset="4476217">There isn't any way that anybody can be hurt going between these two cars which are coupled by the several process of shoving them together by hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.830" offset="4510699">In fact, the locomotive, whether it's called a locomotive here, our motor track car even started as this record shows by being pushed by hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.289" offset="4548524">In Section -- in 1903, Congress reviewed the question of whether the coverage of vehicles in this legislation should be changed at the request of the Brotherhoods and the Interstate Commerce Commission who had been behind the previous legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.254" offset="4624384">They added the term similar vehicles here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.567" offset="4633684">Actually, they added the definition, trains, locomotives, tenders, cars, and similar vehicles, and Mr. Fuller who was the union representative, who sought this change, pointed out that he needed words like "similar vehicles" in here because cabooses, steam shovels, snowplows, scale cars, and similar conveyances were carried on trains and were operated by a trainmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.597" offset="4737755">That was important that those vehicles were part of trains that the same safeguards be provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.279" offset="4764505">And needless to say, none of these maintenance vehicles are ever operated by parts of trains in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.897" offset="4794911">The second half or really the first half of this instruction that -- it says that this push truck must have a handbrake on it as based on Section 11 of the Act which was Section 2 of the Act of 1910 and is codified in Section 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.146" offset="4883937">That Act arose out of convenience to standardize the various grab irons, handholds, sill steps and what not which had been required by the previous legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.481" offset="4937331">The President referred to it in his message to Congress at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.133" offset="4955930">The hearings make it perfectly clear that what was involved was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.858" offset="4974843">They thought that these items of equipment that the trainmen had began to hold of to do their work around trains ought to be in a standard location and in standard size so that you could reach them automatically without having the hard form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.653" offset="5037955">If you're working there at night with a bad light, you ought to be able to find what they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.269" offset="5056449">Needless to say, that has nothing to do with maintenance-of-way vehicles again, which trainmen never see and certainly never operate with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.262" offset="5096469">Particularly, the requirement of an efficient handbrake which is included in Section 11 comes from this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.142" offset="5135966">Congress, having required air brake systems, the railroads began to let the handbrakes get in this repair because they weren't needed in the operation of the trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.209" offset="5180165">Yet, in switching operations in the yards, particularly in what are known as pumping operations where cars are backed up onto a hob and led off one by one with the workmen riding the train working the handbrake, workmen were getting hurt because the handbrakes had been -- been allowed to get in this repair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.488" offset="5261354">Accordingly, Congress required each freight car, again, each car under this Act to have an efficient handbrake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.526" offset="5297507">Again, the hobbing operation and the switching have nothing to do with this little push truck, which is pushed around by hand when it doesn't haul on the back of a motor-car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.789" offset="5350484">So it is that we say that if you look at the language of the Act and if you look at the history of the Act and the purpose of it, it is crystal clear that Congress never had any intention of making this Act applied to the vehicles which are involved in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1504.106" offset="6119842">Now, just by way of closing, I would like to point out just three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.820" offset="6142621">One is that reading this Act over, reading Section 8 which refers to its coverage and Section 16 which refers to its coverage as far as vehicles are concerned, it's perfectly clear that the whole Act applies or none of it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.679" offset="6214092">In other words, Congress was legislating with respect to a type of equipment and writing a series of requirements for that type of equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.228" offset="6248260">It isn't possible to say that a car is under the Act for purposes of brakes but out for purposes of couplers and back under for purposes of grab irons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.960" offset="6291205">Secondly, that it isn't possible to construe the Act as the lower court did or the Court of Appeals did in this case and as the Florida Court did in Martin versus Johnston to hold that we will simply lift the rule out of this Act to decide a specific case, if we think that it's a good idea to have the device to meet safety needs we see to solve this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.589" offset="6433729">Thirdly, we do say that for 64 years, everyone interested in the railroad industry, the railroads, the associations, the Brotherhoods and the Commission have assumed that this Act did not apply and that if it is to be made to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.198" offset="6508126">Today, it ought to be made to apply as a result of some study of what the Safety Appliance in this industry really are and some assurance rather than what this type of record will ever disclose as to what the needs are.</text>

            <text syncTime="1622.882" offset="6594853">With the last statement made by Mr. Ailes, I'm in complete agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.129" offset="6619930">I'm in agreement with nothing else that he said in argument of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.623" offset="6641873">The first point that we have made in our brief and which I urge on the Court and the few minutes left to me this afternoon is that the writ in this case was improvidently granted and should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.950" offset="6699133">The matter which has been argued by Mr. Ailes here and which appears in extent so in his brief is not the question that was before the courts below, and was not the question presented to this Court in the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.144" offset="6779904">And we have set that out very clearly in the opening pages of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.120" offset="6803832">This, which began as a very simple issue under the Federal Employers' Liability Act between a then 70-year old Negro employee of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad and the railroad because of an accident that might happen any day to the man that -- or tell to use these vehicles on the railroad has now grown in the argument before this Court into a cause which according to the Baltimore &amp; Ohio becomes of momentous interest to the railroad interest throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.244" offset="6960358">As interested as I am, as a lawyer, in the establishment of fundamental railroad law as Mr. Jackson's attorney in this case, I am frankly, Your Honors, interested only in the decision of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.081" offset="7031724">Now, the issue presented below three times in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and on appeal before the Court of Appeals for this -- of this Circuit was whether the Section 6 exemption applied to these vehicles and nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.521" offset="7137468">And it was as clear as anything could be that the Section 6 exemption does not apply whether it be read as language of a statute that is handed to us without any background or whether as the courts below in trying to read out or read some sense into the legislative history how to construe it in either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.702" offset="7250213">It cannot possibly apply to these vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.220" offset="7268289">Your Honors will find as we get into a consideration of this history of the Section 6 exemption and its amendment that instead of trying to analyze the meaning of the words we get into what Justice Jackson once called, as I recall it, the psychoanalysis of the Congress because the 1896 Congress had no idea what the 1893 Congress was talking about when it first adopted this proviso and the 1896 Congress was the one that amended the proviso.</text>
