            <label>Mr. Sidney Kansas</label>
            <text syncTime="25.060" offset="203630">And as much as the Government does not approve the decision of the lower court that the Attorney General as an indispensable party and thereby concedes that he is not indispensable in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.468" offset="261204">And then as much as the District Court dismissed solely on the ground that the Attorney General was not made a party and which decision was approved by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.653" offset="313971">I, therefore, ask for relief that the decision of the court below and the District Court to be reversed as to the indispensability of the Attorney General in order that the case maybe remanded to the District Court, in order to proceed that they hear the petition on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.187" offset="416162">Now, I'll proceed to the second phase of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.205" offset="432149">Now, there -- to me, that's -- it is a very simple matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.685" offset="454092">There are two sections of the law required interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.616" offset="477811">I am guided in my interpretation of the Selective Training and Service Act and Section 315 by the unanimous decision of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia and other federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.868" offset="534862">Now, the point involved here is whether this alien forfeited his right to naturalization and whether he is no longer eligible for him to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.817" offset="590660">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="122.373" offset="592854">Because he has merely filed an application which was not accepted, quite the contrary, he was placed in Class I-A, ordered to appear for preinduction and physical examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.447" offset="645204">And therefore, and so the Court of Appeals hold, he was not exempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.657" offset="669968">Now, in the application for a certificate of naturalization, it doesn't necessarily follow that it will be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.137" offset="707897">It may be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.301" offset="712600">That's only the preliminary step.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.366" offset="720854">There are some of the other things that he must comply with, so many other rules and regulations, such as showing that as a question of good moral character as the Court is well familiar with those requirements and it must reside a minimum period of time and that he is not connected with any subversive activities and many others.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.282" offset="792534">Before, the naturalization service will be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.580" offset="809671">Likewise here, if it is found that he is eligible for naturalization that doesn't mean that he may apply for naturalization even in the near future.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.930" offset="855124">But that eligibility gives him the privilege of applying for a suspension of his deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.873" offset="886888">Without that eligibility, he cannot even apply for suspension of his deportation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.670" offset="914056">Now as I stated yesterday, this man is a highly intellectual man, well-educated, has a home of his own in (Inaudible) and he is married to a woman who was born in the United States and they have three small children all born in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="753.546" offset="3117537">On page 3 of my brief, the top of the page, at the time of the discussion prior to the enactment of the 1952 Act, it is my privilege to have -- had the number of discussions with the late Senator Pat McCarran on that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.573" offset="3193710">They were concerned somewhat with the large number of suspension cases that was then pending as to how we are going to bring him into the 1952 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.026" offset="3243447">Prior to the 1952 Act, all suspension cases were brought under the 1917 Act, Section 19 (c) thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.173" offset="3280018">The 1924 Act was known as the Quota Law, restrictions of entering the United States according to quotas.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.089" offset="3303737">But the real contents of our Immigration Law is with the 1917 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.144" offset="3319933">Now, under that Act, I'm reading now page 3, on top of the page of my brief, Section 19 (c), the Immigration Act, in case of any alien who is deportable under any law of the United States and who has proved good moral character for the preceding five years, the Attorney General may suspend deportation of such alien if he is not ineligible for naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.649" offset="3413974">If he finds that such deportation would result to serious economic detriment to a citizen who is the spouse or minor child of such deportable alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.553" offset="3449605">Now, in order to carry over the suspension cases into the 1952 provisions, so that the benefits of the 1952 Act would inure to the suspension cases then pending, a new Section was placed to the law, Section 405 (a) and that's in the middle of page 3 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.147" offset="3539989">Now, that Section reads, an application for suspension of deportation under Section 19, which I just read, of the Immigration Act of 1917 as amended which is pending on the date of the enactment of this Act, shall be regarded as a proceeding within the meaning of this subsection.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.806" offset="3614595">And nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect the validity of any proceeding which shall be valid at the time that this Act shall take effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.972" offset="3655241">Then follows the Selective Training and Service Act which we have just read.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.193" offset="3676139">Now therefore, the intent of Congress both as to suspension and the 1940 Act may be included in that, if Your Honor pleases, to be carried over under the 1952 Act, so that the suspension cases replaced on the 405, Section 405 and Section 315 clarifies the preceding Act under the Selective Training and Service Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.108" offset="3787839">Therefore, in this instance, all that we are seeking here is the -- the proper application and the proper interpretation of these two Sections will give us the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.210" offset="3832247">And as I repeat, I am guided in the interpretations by the unanimous decision of the Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia where they held and to refresh the Court memory, I -- may I read that again?</text>
            <text syncTime="945.567" offset="3885641">At the top of page 16 of my brief, here's the interpretation placed by the Court of Appeals, page 16, to debar the appellee from citizenship, the statute requires proof not only that he applied for exemption on the grounds of alienage, but also that he was relieved from serving for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.768" offset="3974457">And the examiner's legal conclusion that appellee was relieved from military service because of alienage is not supported by any evidence in the present record.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.986" offset="4011342">We think the total absence of any such essential evidence is a sufficient basis for affirming the District Court's order granting naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.226" offset="4044257">There, the situation was the same as ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.891" offset="4054915">This alien applied for relief and exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.755" offset="4074350">Nothing was done by the Selective Service Board here for over a year, so he applied for naturalization in the District Court, District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.078" offset="4111653">And the District Court granted it and the Government appealed and there's a decision as the result of the -- of the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.292" offset="4148537">Now in our case, it's even stronger than the one that I addressed in the (Inaudible) case because in -- in the present case, one of the bar, he was actually placed in Class I-A and ordered to appear for preinduction and physical examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.703" offset="4226173">Therefore, not being debarred or relieved, he hasn't offered his right to apply for naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.016" offset="4255431">Now, I made the comparison a little while ago and Your Honor mentioned about naturalization certificate and this certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.422" offset="4289076">The filing of this certificate for the right makes some eligible to file for a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.720" offset="4314258">The proper interpretation would be this doesn't give him citizenship by -- by granting this right of filing for naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.489" offset="4353337">In itself, it doesn't give him a -- he has to first file his application for citizenship and it may be denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1614.168" offset="6560057">While the Court properly rested its substantive holding on the ground that the statute, Section 3 (a), the Selective Training and Service Act, imposed debarment from citizenship upon the Act of the alien and making application for exemption regardless of whether the alien actually receive relief from service we suggest first that this issue may not be reached since petitioner did actually obtain exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.008" offset="6651382">There is no scintilla of evidence anywhere from the record that he -- he obtained exemption quite the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.768" offset="6674474">His application for exemption was disregarded and he was ordered to -- and placed in Class I-A.</text>

            <text syncTime="1650.771" offset="6706448">There's no citation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.547" offset="6709582">This is simply the opinion of the person who prepared this brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.161" offset="6724002">And furthermore, again on page 9 under (b), it says, in any event petitioner received actual exemption from this Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.351" offset="6756812">That's not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.356" offset="6764753">The -- the petitioner takes the position that because the Selective Training and Service Act or the Selective Board did nothing for a year or more that that is tantamount to an exemption in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.910" offset="6827029">Now, I don't know how he arrives with that but that's what he phases it out.</text>

            <text syncTime="1689.604" offset="6861824">But I should think that the -- on page -- this is the -- the price winner as I call it on page 17 at the bottom of the page of the brief with the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.564" offset="6913651">Now, here's what he said, upon the making of a proper application, the relief becomes effective under the Act or sustained.</text>

            <text syncTime="1725.332" offset="7004662">There's no citation and again simply the equational opinion of the -- one pair of the brief because in -- in view of the clear statement of the Act itself, on page -- here, page 3, page 4, page 4, I'm reading, the Act itself, and I'm now referring to the Selective Training and Service Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.797" offset="7098598">In the manner prescribed, he shall be relieved from such liability in the manner prescribed by and in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the President.</text>

            <text syncTime="1768.783" offset="7178533">It just -- it just doesn't work out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.727" offset="7186265">Now, the rules and regulations referred to are found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 22, Section 622 and 623.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.316" offset="7228688">They provide the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.354" offset="7236838">I have it here in front me on page 18, in middle of the page, if the Court pleases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.401" offset="7257004">Now, the -- the regulations operated under the time the petitioner signed this Form 301 established the specific modus operandi to affect under the Selective Service law and then the exemption from the military service because of alienage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.722" offset="7326281">What does it say?</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.427" offset="7329102">Section 622 of -- of 32 CFR, provided that an alien registered of a neutral country who files Form 301, he uses the word neutral here but I'll try to explain that the subsequent reference to that simply said alienage and that answers the neutral part of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2002.448" offset="8113194">That is, it does not depend upon findings that would be made by the -- by the trial court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2017.023" offset="8171499">On the substantive issue, we view the case in somewhat different light from petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.659" offset="8202010">We think it has a relatively narrow compass, indeed quite a narrow compass as I would try to explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.069" offset="8231685">If the Court would bear with me for a moment, I would like to state categorically certain propositions which I will try to develop in the course of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.307" offset="8264600">And the first thing I'd like to express is that this is not a naturalization case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.740" offset="8282363">This is a suspension of deportation case and the -- and the importance of that is if this were a naturalization case, it would be governed by the 1952 Act because it is a suspension of deportation case in which the application for suspension was made before the 1952 Act as I shall try to development in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.143" offset="8355924">It is governed by the prior law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.391" offset="8368985">In other words, in our view this entire case is governed by the law prior to the 1952 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.467" offset="8401272">And if I can summarize the opposing positions of counsel and myself, he relies almost entirely upon the wording of Section 315 of the 1952 Act which we do not think is in the case at all and we rely upon the wording mainly of Section 3 (a) of the 1942 Act which we think is the controlling statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.858" offset="8490820">The third statement which I'd like to make categorically at the beginning is that it -- in our view it does make a difference that petitioner was the -- was a subject or citizen of a neutral country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.478" offset="8553305">We think that it's crucial and Colombia was first neutral and then became a cobelligerent and ally of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.175" offset="8588100">And since the Chief Justice has asked that question, I would like to make a short answer by first pointing out that under the Selective Service and Training Act of 1940, as it was amended in -- in December after Pearl Harbor, perhaps I should go back and say that when it was first enacted in 1940, in October or September, all citizens were subject to the draft and all declarant aliens, only declarant aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.716" offset="8694262">And it didn't make any distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.385" offset="8700949">Of course, there weren't any neutral countries or we -- since we weren't in the war, we were neutral as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.396" offset="8724982">And we didn't make any distinction between declarant aliens of any country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.491" offset="8745357">After the war, shortly after Pearl Harbor, the statute was amended to provide for the drafting, not only of citizens, but of every other male person residing in the United States and that covered, of course, all aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.517" offset="8801468">Then, the statute all aliens, neutral or cobelligerent, then the statute went on to make a special exemption for neutral aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.203" offset="8836159">It says that any citizens who are subject of have a neutral country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.039" offset="8847548">It doesn't say anything about a cobelligerent and the practice during the war, and throughout the war was to draft the citizens of cobelligerent countries, allied countries unless there were some special arrangements with the country by which the alien would serve in the forces of that country rather than in our country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.750" offset="8918392">So it is crucial to the case in our view that Colombia, the country of the nationality of the petitioner at that time was first a neutral country and did not become a cobelligerent until November 26, 1943 which was some three or four months after he had filed his application for exemption as a neutral alien.</text>

            <text syncTime="2283.561" offset="9237608">A petitioner is a man now about 43 years of age, so in 1942, he was about 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.272" offset="9264462">He is a -- he was then a subject of Colombia in South America.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.075" offset="9287659">He entered the United States for permanent residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.384" offset="9300929">There's no dispute about that in February 1942, after Pearl Harbor and after the statute had been amended as I have said to a -- to make everybody liable for the draft but to exempt neutral aliens subject to proviso about debarment from citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.107" offset="9371773">In May 1942, he registered under this Draft Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.410" offset="9392985">And then for reasons that -- for the record does not reveal, he was not troubled by the Draft Board, though he was a single man of about 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.630" offset="9429870">Apparently for quite sometime, there -- and some indication that were discussions by him with the Draft Board, but all we can say as a matter of hard fact is that in June 1943, about a year after he applied, he registered under the draft, he was given an alien statement, a personal statement which aliens were asked to fill out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.284" offset="9516492">And in the course of that statement, one of the questions is, I do or I do not object to service in the Armed Forces of the United States and the alien was required to fill any of his own handwriting either the word, “I do or I do not.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2930.272" offset="11824462">He filed an application and he then applied for suspension of deportation and the Government contended that he was ineligible for citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.377" offset="11856854">This Court held that since he was a temporary resident and temporary residence were not covered by the draft his application was -- as if it were no application even though he had physically filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.684" offset="11918085">So it's possible to hold that a man who makes an application even though where he isn't covered by, that is where he can go, but there's no proper application -- hasn't made an application and therefore, he isn't debarred from citizenship.</text>

            <text syncTime="3380.327" offset="13624717">The Immigration Service and the Board of Immigration Appeals process this as we think quite properly under the provisions of the old law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3400.731" offset="13706324">The old law said that you could get suspension without any period of residence in the United States if you merely proved a good conduct for five years and it didn't require that you have been physically present in the United States for that five-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.400" offset="13764942">The new law requires in some cases that you -- and requires in all cases that there'd be a period of physical presence in the United States, sometimes five years, sometimes 10 years, continuous physical presence in the United States at the new law, sometimes five years, sometimes 10 years, which was not true under the old law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.588" offset="13841742">Under the old law, you could get -- you are eligible for suspension if there were a serious economic detriment to your wife or your children if they were American citizens.</text>

            <text syncTime="3450.578" offset="13905690">So that standard is tougher under the new law than it was under the old law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.030" offset="13923453">But there was one factor in which the old law was more rigid if you might say than the new law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.046" offset="13947591">The old law required that you'll be eligible for naturalization and that's why this issue arises.</text>

            <text syncTime="3834.196" offset="15440123">Now if I could, I'd like to go on to try to show that under Section 3 (a) of the statute, the -- a neutral alien who filed this application was automatically exempted without any further requirement of administrative ruling or determination by the Draft Board without the necessity of his receiving a card such as most of us received in those days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.889" offset="15542941">And -- and the reason why we say that is because the terms of the statute seemed to apply that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3866.969" offset="15571257">We printed the relevant portions on that in our brief on page 24 and it says, “Any citizen or subject to a neutral country shall be relieved from liability if he has made application to be relieved from such liability in the manner prescribed by and in accordance with the -- the rules and regulations prescribed by the President.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.971" offset="15663208">Now, the statement as to the rules and regulations prescribed by the President modifies the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3898.215" offset="15696227">There were rules and regulations as to what the form of the application was to be and the Selective Service System on delegation with the President prescribed this form which the man filled out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.041" offset="15747532">So that what Congress said was that if a form was filed in the appropriate -- appropriate form prescribed by the President, then he shall be relieved from service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.153" offset="15808031">There is no question here that this man filed the appropriate form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3929.370" offset="15820884">It was on the form prepared by the Selective Service System.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.348" offset="15836766">And in our view, that meant that he was automatically thereafter relieved from service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.970" offset="15859231">Now, this view is consistent with the legislative history and with the regulations at the time because the legislative history is certainly not compelling or conclusive and may not even be fully illuminating but to all the references are to a man who makes the application being relieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3958.977" offset="15939271">Fairly, there was to be no discretion in the Draft Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.098" offset="15951809">The Draft Board did not have the power to say, “Well, Mr. Ceballos shall not be relieved even though he filed that application on this form and he is in fact a citizen of Colombia which is a neutral country."</text>

            <text syncTime="4587.909" offset="18454967">I think the purpose of Congress in putting this Section in was to do away with certain lower court cases in which the alien had claimed that he -- he was put in Class I-A and the Draft Board said, “No, we put you in Class IV-C.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4652.111" offset="18711803">I have some suggestions I can make as to the reason why the change was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4657.226" offset="18732283">And the first thing is that the new Act applies to any alien who applies or has applied for exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="4664.158" offset="18759973">It's not limited to neutral aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4666.101" offset="18767809">The old law was limited to neutral aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4670.038" offset="18783483">The law which we think applies here at Section 3 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="4672.947" offset="18795186">The new law is broader in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4674.761" offset="18802395">It applies to any alien who applies and there are other categories of alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="4677.995" offset="18815352">There were enemy aliens during the World War II and there were, of course, cobelligerent aliens, citizens of France or Great Britain, allied countries and that we think a very significant difference for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="4691.335" offset="18868746">During World War II, enemy aliens, German or Italian or Japanese citizens, who still were such, were not drafted if they object the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4703.877" offset="18918902">They were not drafted because they -- the army didn't want to take them if they objected the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4708.535" offset="18937501">And a great many of them were exempted from service not under Section 3 (a), but under other provisions of the law because the President had a general power to exempt any -- any class of persons that he wanted to from -- from the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="4724.027" offset="18999463">And enemy aliens were exempted on -- if they said they didn't want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4729.272" offset="19020466">Now, it may very well -- then the purpose of Congress to say that an enemy alien, not a neutral, but an enemy alien who did object to service should be debarred from citizenship but to require in this case that he also to be relieved, also be relieved because he -- he wasn't -- he didn't have a statutory entitlement to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.542" offset="19105520">It was a matter of discretion with the President of the army not in Selective Service System as a whole, not the local draft board but the Selective Service System.</text>
            <text syncTime="4759.736" offset="19142301">So that's one category of cases not covered by the old law which is covered by the new law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4765.502" offset="19165393">Then, there were other aliens who might have been deferred because the President, as I said, had the general power to exempt any classes of persons that he wished.</text>
            <text syncTime="4776.800" offset="19210533">I don't believe that he used it during World War II very frequently but there are some suggestion that he may have as to a certain few citizens or countries but it was again a matter of his discretion and it may very well then that Congress wanted to cover that class of aliens who would not have been debarred under the neutral provisions of Section 3 (a) because they weren't neutrals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4797.621" offset="19293811">They were cobelligerent or -- or somebody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="4801.726" offset="19310320">Then, it's possible also that this provision was intended to cover, to carry forward the 1918 debarment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4811.936" offset="19351071">In World War I, they had a comparable but differently worded provision and it may vary well be that they -- and there were some -- that -- that 1918 provision was repealed by the Nationality Act of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.223" offset="19408227">There was dispute as to whether it continued, nevertheless, after its specific repeal or may very well have been that Congress by this provision wanted to cover that old 1918 debarment and there are other circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4841.325" offset="19468622">But the main thing that I would like to communicate is that the new Act is broader.</text>
            <text syncTime="4846.391" offset="19488893">It refers to any alien not to any neutral alien and any alien could be an alien who applied and then was not given the exemption because the President didn't want to give it to him or the Selective Service System or the army wanted to take him anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.121" offset="19543855">And Congress may have thought that in those cases as to whom they were creating a debarment from citizenship for the first time that debarment for those aliens and exist under the prior law as to those aliens for whom they were creating a new debarment that they ought to require and not only the -- the application but an actual relief because those aliens didn't have what I think this alien had a specific statutory entitlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4887.474" offset="19653256">If I may interject my own view, I -- I think that the best reconciliation of Section 315 which we think isn't here, I mean isn't present in this case, with the old law is to say that under -- under the old law, there was an automatic exemption the min -- the minute the man filed the application in proper form.</text>
            <text syncTime="4906.926" offset="19731101">There was an automatic exemption that would come under the new law because he would have filed the application and he would have been exempt from service automatically regardless of whether the Draft Board sent him a card or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4918.834" offset="19778748">I think that's the best reconciliation of -- of the statute but there are these other situations which Congress may have been intending to cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="4933.732" offset="19838307">I haven't said too much except tangentially on the -- our position that the mere application is enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="4941.887" offset="19870908">That too follows in the word -- the words of the statute because as it's already been pointed out by the Court, the proviso of Section 3 (a), the very last part in the Government's brief at page 48, says in -- in expressed terms, any person who makes such application shall thereafter be debarred.</text>
            <text syncTime="4960.835" offset="19946663">And -- and the actual form signed by the alien says, I understand that in making this application, I will be debarred.</text>
            <text syncTime="4973.347" offset="19996714">It's on page 4 of the Government's brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="5035.564" offset="20245608">There is a provision of the statute relating to naturalization of persons in the arm services which does away with -- a lot of the requirements of other -- for the -- of -- of civilian naturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5047.027" offset="20291480">And it may be, it has been suggested, the case has not come to this Court, it hasn't come to any appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5052.574" offset="20313631">It may be that that provision providing for naturalization while the man is in service does not carry with -- with it this debarment provision of this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5064.385" offset="20360861">That is a man who's actually drafted may possibly be able to secure naturalization under that special provision without these qualifications just as he can get naturalization without the qualifications, other -- other qualifications ordinarily applicable to people who want to get -- become American citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="5080.839" offset="20426689">That's one answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5083.845" offset="20438706">The second and more broader answer is that the history of this provision, which first came into the law in 1918 but was mooted, discussed in -- in the Civil War is that the purpose -- historical purpose is that a man who -- who indicates in times of strife and struggle that he doesn't want to serve in the forces -- in the force of United States isn't the kind of man we want to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="5109.168" offset="20540061">It wasn't a penalty or what shall I say an encouragement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5112.443" offset="20553122">It wasn't meant to say to the man, "Now, look if you don't come into the army, we won't let you become a citizen."</text>
            <text syncTime="5117.790" offset="20574542">It was rather an indication that the man made this choice deliberately.</text>

            <text syncTime="5124.029" offset="20599515">He wasn't the kind of man that -- that Congress wanted to have as a citizen and that's the -- the -- one of the primary threads that runs through the history of this -- of -- of this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="5135.569" offset="20645700">Such people aren't the right type to become citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="5139.577" offset="20661687">And that -- that interpretation as a -- and which I say is a qualification for citizenship rather than a penalty imposed upon the man is also consistent with our international obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5153.504" offset="20717380">As I've said, we have international obligations in our view, under international law and some cases on a treaty because of countries, these neutral countries, not to draft their citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="5165.105" offset="20763773">Perhaps, it would be inconsistent with that for us to say, we're going to try to force your citizens into the army by imposing penalties on them by saying if you don't come into the army, you will not be debarred from citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="5178.626" offset="20817899">It would certainly not be inconsistent with that -- with our position towards other country to say, "We control for ourselves what kind of persons we want to become nationals of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="5202.964" offset="20915179">In other words, if it's construed as a penalty imposed upon the man requiring -- trying to force him into the army, in some degree runs countered to our international obligation toward other countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="5216.182" offset="20968051">If it's not construed as a penalty but is imposing debarment on the basis of the application alone, then it comes with the category of our own domestic establishment of qualifications for naturalizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5229.924" offset="21023117">And in the same connection, all the lower court cases, all the lower court cases and they are in five circuits, Courts Of Appeals and in many District Courts, they are all unanimous in holding that the fact -- that the mere fact that a man was once exempted and then has his exemption taken away or tries to remove the exemption himself, tries to take back his form does not or -- or shall I say remove the debarment, they are all unanimous in holding that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5258.450" offset="21137220">The First Circuit, the Second Circuit, the Third Circuit, the Ninth Circuit and the District of Columbia Circuit, District of Columbia reiterated it as recently as December 13th last year that as to an alien who was -- who filed the form and was exempted if he -- if he thereafter, because his country becomes a cobelligerent or for some other reason, is either classified in I-A or -- and subject to induction or -- or tried himself to withdraw his application later, generally, because he -- he realizes what he's done or sometimes because he's overage then and the withdrawal of the application won't -- won't affect it.</text>
