            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">The next case is Number 78, the United States versus The Allen-Bradley Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.194" offset="188165">Mr. Zarky.</text>

            <label>Mr. Hilbert P. Zarky</label>
            <text syncTime="22.084" offset="191718">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.384" offset="212929">This case and the next succeeding case are both tax cases and they both involve a common ultimate question.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.916" offset="259009">And that question is simply this, whether this taxpayers who receive so called certificates of necessity with respect to certain property, and whether the certifying officials in issuing the certificate limited it to a percentage less than 100% of the cost of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.238" offset="356289">Whether under those circumstances, the taxpayers are entitled to a tax deduction based on 100% of the cost of the property as the Court of Claims held in this case or whether as the Government contends, the taxpayer's deduction must be limited to the percentage of cost which these certifying officials in the certificate found were necessary in the interest of the national defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.109" offset="483767">Our position is to hold our first contention, our first argument is that the statutory authority which Congress granted, the discretion did entrust to -- to these officials was sufficiently broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.390" offset="552939">So that they could, as they did in this case and then the other cases, issue certificates of necessity limited to some percentage, some portion of the cost less than 100%.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.028" offset="607483">Now, of course, if the Court agrees with that contention of ours, that ends the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.428" offset="633083">We have, moreover, a -- an alternative argument, that is, if the Court should disagree, if it should hold that the statute was not sufficiently broad to permit these partial certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.243" offset="692328">In other words if Congress didn't require the administrative officials in determining what was in the interest of the national defense to answer that question yes or no, and nowhere in between, we say that nonetheless, the taxpayers are not entitled to prevail for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.443" offset="777174">That, having accepted these certificates, some 10 years ago, without any challenge, without any attempt to litigate in the courts the question whether the certificates were authorized by the statute or not, having in fact treated in their tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.098" offset="851780">The certificate's as valid because they took the tax deductions just as we say they should.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.315" offset="880619">That under those circumstances, the taxpayers cannot, in a tax proceeding before the Court of Claims in this case or in the Tax Court in the next case, obtain deductions on 100% of the property for these reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.105" offset="947806">Namely, their right to a deduction of 100%, even if the administrative officials had answered these 100% or 0% were dependent upon having certificates that 100% of the cost of property was necessary indeed because of the national defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.062" offset="1023666">This, of course, the administrative officials did not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.608" offset="1041847">And we may obtain in our second proposition that neither the Court of Claims nor the Tax Court, in this tax proceeding, could substitute its judgment for that of the administrative officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.748" offset="1094405">It could not -- it could itself determine that these facilities were in their entirety for 100% of their cause necessary in the interest of the national defense and grant deduction just as though certificates of that kind had been issued.</text>

            <text syncTime="267.817" offset="1174653">In the next case, which is the Second Circuit case, the Second Circuit as I understand it didn't reach the underlying question as to the interpretation of section 124 (f).</text>

            <text syncTime="280.316" offset="1224600">It went under procedural ground, namely, that mandamus would not rely and that the determination could not be collaterally attacked in the -- in the tax proceeding, right?</text>

            <label>Mr. Hilbert P. Zarky</label>
            <text syncTime="293.369" offset="1276844">Well, I think, Mr. Justice Harlan, they answered the question which I was just now describing, namely, that they were saying as I understand the opinion below that the Tax Court couldn't itself exercise the discretion entrusted to the administrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.854" offset="1342777">The Tax Court could not decide that these facilities were necessary in the interest of the national defense for 100% of the cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.180" offset="1380080">Let me expostulate and I'll get back to that my second point later.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.567" offset="1401605">For example, if the taxpayers immediately upon being issued the certificates had gone into a district court of the United States and said, "This is wrong.Congress hasn't authorized you to do this."</text>
            <text syncTime="339.183" offset="1460120">We believe, a district court properly could have done no more, had it agreed that that was an erroneous interpretation of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.611" offset="1489795">Then to send the matter back to the certifying officials and say, use your discretion within the limit set -- set forth by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.133" offset="1527933">But it would not itself have said, Mr. Taxpayer, you are entitled to 100% certificate, and we of the District Court, I will decide that that's a certificate you are entitled to and I will mandamus the official to issue it.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.398" offset="1597001">And as I read the Second Circuit's opinion, what it said was -- which is our position namely, you don't have 100% certificate, the Tax Court couldn't issue you one, the Tax Court couldn't exercise that discretion and therefore, the Tax Court is wrong in granting you relief as though you had 100% certificate.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="392.993" offset="1675368">But that would not mean that you'd necessarily reach the question that is the underlying question, as to whether the WPB had the power in the first instance to grant 100% certificate.</text>

            <text syncTime="417.615" offset="1773798">And logically, we start with the proposition what they did was correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="422.269" offset="1792397">What they did was within what Congress gave them the power to do, and that's the proposition I would like to argue first and then, argue the second proposition namely that in any event, the Tax Court or the Court of Claims couldn't do what they did in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.363" offset="1868779">Do I -- I make our ultimate position clear?</text>
            <text syncTime="443.425" offset="1877034">I have -- don't want to elaborate at this point, but --</text>

            <text syncTime="490.451" offset="2065220">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.835" offset="2082670">As a preliminary matter with the Court's indulgence before I get to discussing these precise legal issues, I think that what's involved may become clearer or be seen in -- in its proper light or perspective if I were to first briefly sketch the problem as it existed out of which these cases arrive.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.381" offset="2184861">As I said they're tax questions but, unlike most tax questions, the major context out of which they arise are not tax problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.276" offset="2224462">I must take Your Honors back to the period of 1940, when the situation in Europe was such that, I need scarcely remind the Court what it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.161" offset="2272005">This country was engaged in embarking on a tremendous defense program.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.097" offset="2299800">What was needed was a great expansion in our plant facilities capable of producing the -- all the items which we were then intent to finally sending to what would eventually become our allies and then producing the things that we ourselves would need shortly when we became engaged in a war.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.348" offset="2388720">The problem confronting Congress, the administration on that point in achieving as fast expansion that was needed in plant capacity was to encourage for the most part private capital to construct these facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.107" offset="2459773">Private capital was reluctant at that time because well, they and the treasury were convinced that existing provisions of the internal revenue law were not sufficient to safeguard the tax problems that might arise in other words, that the manufacturer were asked to produce -- to build a plant capable of producing more facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.982" offset="2555277">He might in a short period of time find if the war was over, the plant was useless.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.899" offset="2578996">And there was no assurance that his tax deductions during the time when the facilities were being used and that prior to being created would be sufficient to safeguard his interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.371" offset="2628838">And the proposal put to Congress was the amortization program which -- out of which these cases arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.668" offset="2670007">This amortization program was proposed to Congress on the Second Revenue Act of 1940, when the first excess profit tax simultaneously being proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.580" offset="2709713">And that, of course, made the problem even more urgent because of the high tax rates that were going to be imposed upon corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.929" offset="2755062">In that -- from the hearings, in legislative history, that Second Revenue Act of 1940, these amortization features which I will describe to you were proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.538" offset="2801560">And the same time, Congress was told that the Government, of course, would be unable to rely completely upon private capital that a large amount of the plant expansion would have to come from Government financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.443" offset="2857148">This would take several forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.991" offset="2867388">Either a Government -- we build plants with Government funds operated by Government personnel, or a Government -- the built plant which would be leased to a private manufacture at an annual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.266" offset="2924440">Or another avenue was the so-called defense plant facilities contracts under which we advanced the money to the contractor, deeds of legal title to the plant that was built but the beneficial use was in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.102" offset="2987760">So that real ownership was in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.901" offset="2998941">So, what Congress saw in the type of program where the Government financing under several ways of encouraging private financing under a scheme which would mean really with the indirect Government financing because it would be at the sacrifice of revenue which might otherwise be collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.194" offset="3076159">The amortization program -- the amortization provisions were nothing more than accelerated depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.036" offset="3119522">What Congress did was to tell the taxpayer if you obtain a certificate from proper officials that the plant or a portion of it is necessary in the interest of the national defense, we will give you absolute assurance that those certified cause can be deducted by you against your income during a period of no more than five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.276" offset="3228505">Or that was the other limits, at higher cost to be written off during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.768" offset="3250448">The period could also be shorter.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.393" offset="3256926">In other words, if the emergency were to terminate sooner than five years, you could squeeze the deductions and cover it right off the whole cost within a shorter period, one year or two years depending upon when the plants were constructed and when the emergency terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.502" offset="3333413">So that when I use the term amortization as a statute, that's what we're talking about really, is accelerated depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.433" offset="3373119">Depreciation would still be a problem as it is on these cases and other cases where only part of the cost were subject to amortization.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.792" offset="3410526">In other words, you like to get part of your cost within the five-year period or less and the rest of the cost would be spread over the normal period for depreciation, whatever the useful life of the property was 10, 15, 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.101" offset="3463816">So that ultimately, you got your whole cost back in tax deduction but the real question was how much would you get back rapidly during a period when it was expected that tax rates would be abnormally high.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.601" offset="3517733">And it was in this background that Congress enacted the Second Revenue Act of 1940 adopted the excess profits tax ended up with the amortization provisions of which we deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.016" offset="3567470">During the early period of the -- of its administration, these certificates were being issued by the Secretaries of War and Navy under regulations which they prescribed by the approval of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.118" offset="3615848">And so far as the history shows, for the most part, those certificates were issued for 100%, although, there is indication that partial certificates were issued on occasion when the circumstances warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.648" offset="3677915">Now, the problem of this case arise from the fact that by 1943 -- the middle of 1943, the administration had become convinced that the picture had completely changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.520" offset="3721488">While we still did not have all the tools we needed for war, we did have the plant we needed.</text>
