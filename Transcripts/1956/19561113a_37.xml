            <text syncTime="31.646" offset="229961">With the Court's permission, I would like to make a brief review of the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.086" offset="263711">In 1953, petitioner, Mr. Christianson and Mr. Paster were indicted and tried for the crime of conspiring to violate the Johnson Act, which prohibits the interstate shipment of gambling devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.151" offset="331943">As a result of that trial, petitioner was acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.183" offset="352110">The jury disagreed as to Mr. Christianson and Mr. Paster.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.773" offset="374471">The following year, the Government retried the case against Mr. Christianson and Mr. Paster.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.763" offset="406444">In preparing for the retrial of the Christianson case, the Government procured the issuance of subpoena duces tecum No. 160.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.743" offset="458376">That subpoena was issued on March the 25th, returnable March the 29th, the date set for the beginning of the Christianson retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.722" offset="506232">On March the 29th, Mr. Paster moved to quash the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.654" offset="537997">The motion was denied and the District Judge Vogel issued an order compelling the Mayflower Distributing Company to whom the subpoena had been directed to forthwith comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.219" offset="592227">On April the 1st, Mayflower Distributing Company purported to comply with the subpoena through petitioner, the vice president of Mayflower.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.792" offset="650533">At a hearing in judge's chambers on the return of subpoena 160, petitioner was put under oath and testified concerning the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.003" offset="703404">The Court, dissatisfied with his testimony, issued an impounding order directing the Marshal of North Dakota to impound the records of Mayflower Distributing Company in St. Paul.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.496" offset="757321">That order was issued and the records were impounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.119" offset="771845">The Christianson retrial proceeded to a conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.866" offset="790862">A determination of the Christianson retrial, the Court sua sponte issued an order to show cause why petitioner should not be cited for contempt and set forth three specifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.347" offset="848750">Specification 1, charged him with contempt for false and evasive testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.949" offset="875186">Specification 2, charged him with contempt in disobedience of another subpoena, subpoena 78 and specification 3, charged contempt in disobedience of subpoena No. 160.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.935" offset="939133">The show cause order was issued April 23rd.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.663" offset="954075">It was set down for a hearing on April 27th.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.922" offset="971107">On the morning of April 27th, petitioner asked for an extension of time which was granted until 3 o'clock that afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.035" offset="1015515">At termination of the afternoon hearing, the Court found petitioner guilty of contempt on all three specifications and sentenced him to one year and a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.394" offset="1064939">Petitioner took an appeal to the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.018" offset="1083434">While the case was pending in the Eighth Circuit, the Government filed a supplemental record.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.586" offset="1109765">That supplemental record was discussed at great length last Thursday.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.718" offset="1138291">The supplemental record is the last half of the record now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.761" offset="1170369">It consists of 68 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.001" offset="1187401">Page 69 in the supplemental record, the last half of the record before this Court, is a motion of appellant to strike certain portions of the supplementary record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1136.267" offset="4648417">Now, that has reference -- that reference of the appellate court pertains to another case, Nilva versus United States, a Samuel Nilva.</text>

            <text syncTime="1279.388" offset="5220916">Government counsel then interrogated him, "Did you examine your daily ledger sheet for the months of January, February, March, April of 1951?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.094" offset="5255711">To which petitioner answered "The daily ledger?</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.820" offset="5266683">I am not sure whether we examined the daily ledger," which would appear to be the basic book of any corporate enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.848" offset="5302732">In the middle of page 17, he states that he checked all incoming invoices, all outgoing invoices that we had, all our checks, all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.632" offset="5341915">Well, everything that had anything to do with the purchase as well as anything that had anything to do with the sales, and they're still speaking of used slot machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.299" offset="5380577">Now, on page 20, when government counsel rephrased his question and instead of speaking of the records of Mayflower as showing the purchases, he put it in terms of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.900" offset="5442957">He said, "If I had sold you five machines during the month of January in 1951 and came to you and told you that you hadn't paid me for all of those, do you have any records that will show to the contrary in the Mayflower Distributing Company?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.992" offset="5503352">To which petitioner answered, "I believe that we'd have that record on your account just like Bally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.558" offset="5529579">Bally sold those machines, that's why it was easy to find any matter relating to Bally or United because we dealt with them consistently.</text>
