            <label>Mr. John T. McTernan</label>
            <text syncTime="11.104" offset="147832">My attention was called to the fact that I misspoke in indicating the time as of which these four incidents in the Matusow trial testimony occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.070" offset="195688">They were in July and August of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.992" offset="219303">I would like to turn now to the situation of the hearing on the motion for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.646" offset="241977">There, it's to be emphasized, we asked for a similar production to the Court of the same report as those into which our motion at the trial has been directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.325" offset="296626">In these proceeding, Matusow was petitioner's witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.749" offset="314389">On his direct examination, he gave a complete and detailed recantation of his trial testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.218" offset="344273">Without going into the details here, let me simply refer to appendix 1 of our opening brief where, in parallel columns, the trial testimony and the hearing testimony are compared.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.817" offset="402683">On cross-examination, the Government attacked the recantation as a recent fabrication corruptly induced, and the details of this many-sided and lengthy attack are set out in our opening brief, in rough outline at pages 18 to 20 and in some detail in Appendix 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.034" offset="483558">Now, against this, Matusow, on redirect examination, said that his contemporaneous reports, these documents that are in issue here, to the FBI would show, as I said just before lunch, that he had no conversation with Jencks concerning the Communist Party or the Communist Party activities or party membership and that he, in his reports, never identified Jencks as a Communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.066" offset="599646">Now, in this posture, I submit, the FBI statements of Matusow had obvious relevance for purposes of rehabilitation because these were records made as of a time before the motive to fabricate had been shown to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.681" offset="674147">These were the contemporaneous reports and there's nothing in the evidence dealing with fabrication of a recantation which goes back earlier than 1954, 1955 which, of course, is three, four, or five years after the events occurred and the reports were written.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.330" offset="768711">Now, the Government's position here, as we apprehend it, is that Matusow's trial testimony did not say that Jencks was a Communist and that Matusow's testimony at the hearing concerning his reports did not show a contradiction between the reports and the trial testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.014" offset="867453">Now, I submit that this is simply not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.315" offset="880619">It is not supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.487" offset="889292">I do not want to take the time for a detailed analysis of the evidence here.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.942" offset="907160">We make it at pages 15 to 17 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.155" offset="923982">In short, let me say that if Matusow had been put on at the trial to testify to those four incidents, it was to show admissions on the part of petitioner that he is -- was a member of the Communist Party as of that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.437" offset="985109">Now, that could have been the only purpose of his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.744" offset="998379">Therefore, when he said at the hearing that his reports did not identify Jencks as a Communist, that he -- that they did not reflect conversations concerning the party or party activity or membership, there was a direct and complete contradiction with his trial testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.892" offset="1422921">I -- I read -- I must admit, I was brought up to entertain a very strong conviction about the desirability of the secrecy and non-disclosability of matters before a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.341" offset="1488750">Now, so that -- what -- what are you to say about dealing with your situation in the context of your circumstances and not enabling -- not having any ruling on it -- to serve and to device but, practically, calling for a stop of witnesses who are important witnesses at the trial and who had also been witnesses before the grand jury?</text>

            <text syncTime="396.977" offset="1691251">I think that it would be correct to say that the grand jury minutes are enclosed with a greater degree of privacy than the statements of a witness made to a prosecutor in the course of an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.714" offset="1758229">I would suggest, although I haven't actually sought this problem out, that at least some indication that there had been a shift in the witnesses' recollection of the fact should come out at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.925" offset="1807026">I recall that this issue was decided by the Second Circuit in the Remington case, I think it's 191 F.2d, where, as I recall that case, the witness had testified at the trial that she had changed her mind about certain things at some stage in the -- in the long process between the commission of the alleged crime and the time she testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.438" offset="1921128">And, it was on that basis that the court held that the grand jury minutes there should be turned over to the defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="464.437" offset="1961148">I ought to say that my concern about the speakers of the grand jury proceeding is, perhaps, as much input that they had, at one time, not or little to do with him being in charge of the grand jury in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.110" offset="2027813">There's as much concern, if anything, in the protection of innocent people.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.893" offset="2042964">If he provides there's nothing to talk in the grand jury room that ought never to see the light of day, as innocent as an unborn baby.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.625" offset="2069922">And, if he could just talk, that if you want to open it up -- not nearly tampering the cross-examination, then, ultimately, you're not a mischief.</text>

            <text syncTime="503.309" offset="2116629">Yes, and I think that's another ground upon which grand jury minutes should be treated differently from the things we have here because, here, we're dealing with statements related specifically to the events testified to or the facts testified to at the trial where the grand jury minutes may roam over many areas and touch upon many different people.</text>

            <text syncTime="768.856" offset="3178768">And, as a matter of fact, we agreed to set our hearing at a time to suit the Government's need for investigation, and their investigation of Matusow took place essentially through Judge Dimock's proceedings and the grand jury proceedings that were going along simultaneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.487" offset="3265285">I -- I concede, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, that our case, here, for the production of the record at the trial does not turn upon a showing of contradiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.050" offset="3311574">It turns upon these other policy considerations, to which I think we must add the fact that our effort to show a contradiction was frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.616" offset="3349817">And, given all of the considerations which indicate the policy that I have outlined here, I think that we should not be refused the -- the motion that we asked for simply because this kind of witness especially says, “I have no recollection.”</text>
            <text syncTime="829.502" offset="3421393">Now, getting back to the thread of my argument dealing with the proceeding at the hearing on the motion for a new trial, I submit that in addition to the relevance of these documents for purposes of rehabilitation, they should have been looked at by the trial judge for another and important policy reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.715" offset="3498193">I have already indicated the reliability of these documents as contemporaneous reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.385" offset="3524942">On the motion for a new trial, the trial judge had a special responsibility to exhaust all efforts to find the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.626" offset="3565902">He has to protect the judgment of his court, if truth lies behind that judgment, and he has the responsibility to do justice if truce attacks that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.238" offset="3624312">Given this responsibility of the judge, plus, such facts which I select out of many in the record of the fact of recantation, the claim of corrupt inducement, many prior declarations by this witness which supported his recantation and many would support at his trial testimony, and they're all laid out in some detail in Appendix 2 of our brief, plus, the crucial nature of Matusow's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.308" offset="3732564">We submit that, in this kind of situation, it was essential to apply that this tedious regard principle which this Court annunciated in Communist Party against SACB.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.541" offset="3781569">It was, we submit, the responsibility of the Court on its motion, having -- indeed having knowledge that these reports existed, to inspect them in order to make certain that the doing of justice be made manifest.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.754" offset="3838412">Now, we have involved in this point, if the Court please, one different kind of document, and I emphasize this because there were some confusion in the opinion of the court below as between this document and others that we have already dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.150" offset="3911973">This man, Matusow, went to an FBI agent named Crandall at a time intermediate his grand jury testimony and his trial testimony and said to him, says Matusow at the hearing, “I told him that I did not want to testify in the Jencks trial that was coming up.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.615" offset="3993788">I did not think my testimony was honest.”</text>
            <text syncTime="979.130" offset="4019911">Now, we asked for the production of that document in order to assist in the rehabilitation of Matusow.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.093" offset="4067767">I should say here that Matusow testified at the hearing that when he spoke to this Agent Crandall, he told Crandall what to write down and he said Crandall wrote it down and showed it to him for Matusow's approval, so that I think that -- and Matusow did approve it, so that I think that this document is on the level of a statement by Matusow comparable to the ones that we've been dealing with so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.570" offset="4181661">Now, in addition to the relevancy of this as rehabilitation, because, again, this came before the facts which the Government relies on to show motive for fabrication, there is an additional ground to why this document should have been produced.</text>

            <text syncTime="1054.780" offset="4322513">And, as near -- as nearly as I can put it without looking at the record, he said, “I told Crandall I did not want to testify in the trial -- Jencks trial coming up.</text>

            <text syncTime="1089.960" offset="4463261">If the contemporaneous reports contradicted the grand jury testimony, even by omission in the -- in the matter that I described to the Chief Justice before lunch, the Government, I submit, should have been alerted by that fact of the possibility of perjury in the upcoming trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.946" offset="4547166">Now, we make no charge, if the Court please, that Government counsel is guilty of any kind of misconduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1342.730" offset="5474304">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.310" offset="5508577">With the observation that I've tried to make clear throughout this, we did not ask that these documents be produced directly to us but to the trial court in the manner already indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.978" offset="5559254">Now, if I may, I will pass on to our second point dealing with the instruction on membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.501" offset="5589347">The text of this instruction can be found at page 16 of our opening brief, the one with the green cover, or page 416 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.362" offset="5624769">Our contention is, first, that this instruction gave the jury no legal guidance whatsoever on the question of membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.738" offset="5662281">As we see the problem, the word “member” is not a self-defining term and there is no common understanding as to its meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.741" offset="5694360">The usual approach of the courts has been to define member in each case in terms of the formal requirements of the organization itself, both as to becoming a member and as to remaining a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.203" offset="5748172">And, this Court's construction of the statute appears to be in accord with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.335" offset="5768756">In Douds, it was said that in a case precisely like the one we have here, I don't say that the Douds case was precisely like it but, in describing a set of facts precisely like the situation we have here, that the opinion says that the act of joining is crucial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.879" offset="5842840">We read this to mean not that the Government must prove the specific act of joining in each case, say, as was done in Galvan against Press, but where that proof is lacking, the Government must prove a course of conduct that manifest the existence of the relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.498" offset="5913370">And, in such a case, we submit to have probative force, this course of conduct should be related to the organization's formal requirements or it would have little or no meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.074" offset="5963630">Now, the charge here ignored both the specific act of joining and a course of conduct manifesting that the act of joining had been consummated and the relationship maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.525" offset="6017442">The instruction did not advise the jury that any particular conduct need be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.580" offset="6037713">The charge was permissive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.534" offset="6045550">It specified two kinds of conduct, attendance at meetings or holding office, either one or neither of which the jury might rely upon in producing and in reaching its verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.741" offset="6106363">Ignoring both of these, the jury was permitted to consider what the Court described as conduct consistent only with membership or “all other evidence, direct or circumstantial, which bears or may bear upon the question of whether the defendant was a member on April 28, 1950.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.549" offset="6205524">And, this, without any word of guidance as to what this kind of generality means, consist -- conduct consistent only with member or all other evidence which may bear.</text>

            <text syncTime="1565.789" offset="6366542">This instruction, we submit, the Court's instruction now, not the one we submitted, left it to the jury's personal notions as to legal principle and arbitrary selection of evidence to conclude whether or not, from the evidence, the petitioner was shown to have been a member on the critical date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.844" offset="6462777">If I may return briefly to the question of attendance of Communist Party meeting, the evidence related attendance at “closed the Communist Meetings” or meetings attended by persons -- only by persons “known to be members of the party”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.013" offset="6543444">Now, we submit that this evidence is insufficient in law to prove membership because it is wholly circularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.305" offset="6568626">It assumes the fact sought to be proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.504" offset="6585344">As the Ninth Circuit pointed out in Bridges against the United States, if the defendant was not a member of the Communist Party, then all that his evidence proves is that he attended a meeting at which everybody else was a member.</text>

            <text syncTime="1786.888" offset="7250944">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.117" offset="7271842">The question before this Court is whether or not the trial judge in this case committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion in denying the petitioner several motions for production of FBI reports by or about witnesses who testified for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.613" offset="7361808">In other words, what are the tests with respect to the discovery, for purposes of impeachment, of FBI reports, both oral and written?</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.887" offset="7430875">Now, if the Court please, I should like to focus the Court's attention as to the problems which the courts are faced with in this case that are raised by this case, by discussing for a few moments, first, the FBI reports that have to do with the witness Ford.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.098" offset="7523767">Now, the witness Ford, just in summary, was a member of the Communist Party until September 1950 according to his uncontradicted testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.479" offset="7573295">And, he testified, his latest testimony, so-called pre-affidavit, if that is significant, placed the petitioner at a Communist Party meeting in August of 1949 and he also testified that, as an officer of the Communist Party, as a member of the New Mexico State Board of the party, and also as the security officer of the party for all of that period, nothing had come to his attention up to the time of his severance from the Communist Party to indicate that the petitioner had withdrawn from the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.109" offset="7715819">Now, Ford testified that he reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation over a period of a year, beginning in August of 1948 until August of 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.629" offset="7781857">Now, at this point, I think it important to carefully draw a distinction between written reports and oral reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.205" offset="7820204">Ford's testimony was that his practice was generally to give oral reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.976" offset="7851238">Beyond that, he could not recall, on any specific occasion, as to whether he had given a written report or an oral report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.840" offset="7882689">But, we know from the record that his practice was generally to give oral reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.285" offset="7908498">Now, I know of no rule in criminal law that requires the production, even to the Court, of a memorandum of an interview with the witness for purposes of impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.790" offset="7974536">It seems to me that his ban has a limited application under the civil rules of federal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.848" offset="8006719">We know that in the Hickman case that it was even there stated that as to oral statements made by a witness to the lawyer in that case instead of the investigator, whether presently in the form of his mental impressions or memoranda, we do not believe that any showing of necessity can be made under the circumstances of this case to justify production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.264" offset="8104417">And, the Court proceeded -- this Court proceeded to layout the reasons for it because it puts the witness on the stand instead of the -- the lawyer or the agent on the stand instead of the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.985" offset="8147362">The practice that this Court forces the attorney to testify as to what he remembers or what he saw fit to write down regarding the witness' remarks, such testimony could not qualify as evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.087" offset="8199711">And, to use it for impeachment or corroborative purposes would make the attorney much less an officer of the court and much more an ordinary witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.276" offset="8236492">Now, if such oral reports, at a later time, are then put to writing by the agent --</text>

            <text syncTime="2052.434" offset="8313083">And, we know, too, that, in subsequent law, that the -- the civil rule with respect to production has been somewhat cut down from that when you use people who are not attorneys in -- in civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.149" offset="8363969">The Shoe Machinery case, Judge Wyzanski's opinion in Boston, I think, is quite revealing on that point, but I should like to say that, if the production of an oral report and the memoranda of the interview becomes at issue for impeachment purposes or for corroborative purposes or anything else, it is much more appropriate that it -- the problem be considered during and, if the FBI agent testifies during his testimony on the stand, it then could or could not become relevant but that, of course, is not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.198" offset="8512136">Now, with respect to oral and written reports, both, the question here is, it seems to me, is whether there shall be an automatic rule of disclosure based upon the fact that there are reports, based upon the allegation of counsel that, there being reports, that there might be an inconsistency and, therefore, there should be a production to the Court in order to go through the reports to see if there is an inconsistency between what the witness is now testifying and what he may or may not have told the Federal Bureau of Investigation at some prior time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.449" offset="8689142">Or, whether the rule, as the Government sees it, of the Goldman case and the Gordon case shall control, which is simply that it is within the discretion of the trial judge to determine whether or not, in the circumstances of the case that is unfolding before you, it is relevant to require production for his or counsel's inspection of the so-called report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.778" offset="8798438">Now, I'd like to say right here that we do not -- the Government does not take the position that there must be an admission by the witness himself that there is an inconsistency and let's, for the moment, confine ourselves to a written report, signed a statement, that there is an inconsistency between what the witness is now testifying and what he said at a prior time in that signed statement and that the point is material, and so forth, to the guilt or innocence of the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.036" offset="8943470">If that is the case, discretion leaves off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.057" offset="8959561">Production becomes mandatory, not only to the Court for inspection, but to counsel for the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.304" offset="8988609">But, short of that, it isn't -- the Government's position is that it is within the area of discretion for the trial judge to determine whether or not there has been an adequate foundation laid which would require him to exercise his discretion in favor of the accused and require production of the report and consideration, assuming it's pinpointed, for his inspection or for counsel's inspection as the case may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.092" offset="9103757">Now, I submit, further, that the record in this case will show that the petitioner made no showing of any foundation whatsoever, and I submit further that there was not even an attempt to make a foundation for the production of these reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.451" offset="9193200">It seems to me that the entire argument before Judge Thomason, if Your Honors will read that argument, at the trial rested entirely upon the petitioner's interpretation of what the Second Circuit has held in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.588" offset="9265716">And, the petition there argued what the case, as decided by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, make it mandatory to produce any statements, no distinction made between oral or written statements, any statement made by a witness to the Federal Bureau of Investigation at a prior time upon the mere allegation that there may be an inconsistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.863" offset="9358817">Now, this, I will readily concede that there is room for argument as about what the position of the Second Circuit really is on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.552" offset="9393612">I think and I'm convinced that the Second Circuit has adopted a rule of practice under which the trial judge undertakes to examine statements of witnesses and, in each case that I have read, there has -- there has been no distinction in those cases between oral or written.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.937" offset="9475114">I assume they are written because the Court continually talks about statements made by the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.289" offset="9504580">Now, the Court there undertakes to examine these statements as a matter of practice but no case yet in the Second Circuit or any circuit has gone so far as to say that upon the mere command of counsel for the defendant in the case or allegation that there is an inconsistency or may be an inconsistency that there shall be a production of documents.</text>

            <text syncTime="2485.280" offset="10044479">In other words, the witness may say that there is a meeting of the Communist Party or there was a gathering here or something was said here and he testifies, if he's asked, that he said all these to the FBI agent or that he wrote it down or the FBI agent took notes, asked him to sign it, whatever it was.</text>

            <text syncTime="2560.157" offset="10344051">I understood that Matusow testified that he had a -- a conversation with the defendant, no one else being present, and that, at that conversation, the defendant told him that he was -- that they were going to have an alliance with the Communist Union in Mexico for the purposes of -- of thwarting the Korean War by stopping the -- stopping the export of -- of copper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.747" offset="10462333">Now, I -- I understood also that Matusow had said that he had no recollection of whether he had put that into his report or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.295" offset="10504547">Now, if he -- if the man was paid by the Government to collect evidence and information concerning Communist activities in this country, wouldn't it be reasonable to -- to believe that it would bear on his credibility if he had not put that into his written reports made to the Government?</text>

            <label>Mr. John V. Lindsay</label>
            <text syncTime="2625.257" offset="10604440">Let me answer your question in two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.366" offset="10616874">First of all, as to the specific instance, I made the statement in the early part of my argument that, in my judgment, there had been no even attempt to lay a foundation for the production of these reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.516" offset="10669432">Now, that is certainly true in case of the witness Ford who was the other Government witness, as to which there's a question about production of reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.513" offset="10705377">Now, with respect to Matusow, in the entire record, there are two instances where Matusow was asked whether he told the FBI, whether particular -- that a particular event had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.372" offset="10760861">This was one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.018" offset="10767444">In that connection, I should like to say this, that that fact, that question was asked after the motion for production of Matusow -- the Matusow reports had been made to the Court and denied and it was not renewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.284" offset="10836511">Of course when it comes to the hearing on the motion for a new trial, in my judgment, you have a different question, and I'll get to that in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.440" offset="10865142">Now, secondly, I should like to say this, in answer to your question, sir, and that is that you got here a problem that is much more complicated, it seems to me in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.223" offset="10928253">These can be classified as intelligence reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.766" offset="10942464">Now, right off the bat, let me say there's no claim of privilege claimed by the Government in this case or confidence and the Government never made that assertion or any confidence in the files.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.393" offset="10984991">But, there is a real question as to the, I think, legitimate position of the -- of the Government that it has a right to safeguard the privacy of its files as much as it can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.608" offset="11041834">Intelligence reports of this sort may be voluminous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.552" offset="11057612">One witness may give them over a series of a period of time which is very long.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.975" offset="11087287">There may be lots of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.718" offset="11094288">The FBI may go back to him and then cross-examine him as to points which he did or did not bring up which may not check or do check with the lead that it's got from some other direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.412" offset="11140995">In the Smith Act case, I'm told that it can cover -- a single series of reports from one witness can -- can cover an extraordinary amount of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.457" offset="11181223">They may be written, they may be purely oral of memoranda of interviews, they may be notes taken by the agent at the time and then he dictates a report to his superiors later, or it may be a document that's been initialed by the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.851" offset="11234826">But, in any event, to require the trial judge to -- on the command again, on the allegation that there might be an inconsistency, in any one of those reports or all of them, to go through a series of intelligence reports of that nature which is, in the case of the grand jury minutes, may contain names of perfectly innocent parties, and so forth and so on, may contain investigative techniques, may contain all sorts of things that have no relevance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.925" offset="11363035">This, to me, brings the trial of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.671" offset="11378082">And, to a trial within a trial, you go down side alleys to witnesses the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.891" offset="11402951">You get into fights and quibbles as to whether what he said was inconsistent with this or not inconsistent with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.090" offset="11427715">It may be in my point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.913" offset="11435029">It may be an omission which, frequently, can happen when a witness or potential witness is -- is interviewed by the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.680" offset="11470137">And, even a paid Government informant, he may, at the time, have a full recollection which is -- which is, at a later date, refreshed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.884" offset="11502947">So, I think that --</text>

            <text syncTime="2859.365" offset="11540877">I think it's a -- it's a -- given enough time and patience, I'm sure that -- that a report, an FBI report, no matter how remote, even one that is oral that has been later put to writing, and its grandchildren, the report made from the report, which is -- frequently happens, all of those, I'm sure, can be explained one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.275" offset="11640456">But, what we have here really is a problem of the administration of criminal justice and are we going to tie the hands of the trial judge so that there's no room for discretion left?</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.956" offset="11691238">And, my point is, this is what I keep coming back to and emphasizing, is that in order to sustain the petitioner's contention in this case, you've got to find an abuse of discretion and, to find an abusive discretion here, you've got to rewrite the rule altogether.</text>

            <text syncTime="2984.274" offset="12040443">Certainly, all of those are analyzed and distilled in memorandum made from those, and so forth and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.718" offset="12066252">But, I cannot see that, in the interests of running a Court, which is what we've got here, that the trial judge, who has at his fingertips and sees the case unfold before him and has all of these factors before him, should -- that his -- his power -- his discretionary power should be completely curtailed in his favor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3086.454" offset="12449207">But, I'll say this and I'm completely satisfied now that the Crandall report, which comes in issue on the hearing on the motion for a new trial, I think perhaps stands on even a stronger footing than does the question of the sweeping request made for all reports during the trial itself, and for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.530" offset="12545442">Matusow, at the time with the petitioner's own witness, he testified when he was being cross-examined by the Government that he had had a conversation with FBI Agent Crandall and that he had said to Crandall, in the course of this conversation with Agent Crandall, “I told the FBI agent I didn't want to testify in the Jencks trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3152.448" offset="12713148">Now, right off the bat, there is, to me at least, an ambiguity about the statement made as to what he told the agent.</text>

            <text syncTime="4132.808" offset="16634650">And, Judge Hand says this, “as to the report there, there is not the slightest showing that it was competent as evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.810" offset="16662653">It could only be so in the case, in case it contradicted Swaney's testimony, which was not likely.</text>

            <text syncTime="5585.849" offset="22446791">I think, however, that the Court should not deal itself and find not to decide the problem, as we urge that it would be decided, by what I would characterize, good naturedly, as a bugaboo which the Government -- I think the Government is presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5604.126" offset="22519829">In the first place, this is not a novel problem in the administration of justice, although it is the first time this problem has reached this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5613.603" offset="22557759">The role adopted in the Second Circuit, as I understand it, is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="5619.179" offset="22580120">Judge Learned Hand, a few days after writing the opinion in the Krulewitch case, described in the Cohen case what the Krulewitch case stood for.</text>
            <text syncTime="5628.893" offset="22618990">And, he said, there, we held that when statements are taken by the prosecution which appear upon inspection by the judge to contradict the testimony of the witness when he is called at the trial, the accused should be allowed to inspect them since he cannot, otherwise, impeach the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5647.932" offset="22695058">Now, I think it is important that we emphasize two things from that statement, that the contradiction appears as the result of the inspection by the judge and the practical -- the problem that, otherwise, the contradiction will not appear because it lies not within the power of the defense to show the contradiction except through the mouth of the witness under cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5669.024" offset="22779486">I would say that the case was so rare that it hardly deserves consideration that, under other circumstances, the contradiction between the report or statement and the witness' trial testimony could appear except on the cross-examination of the witness himself.</text>
