            <text syncTime="23.121" offset="195897">Counsel's skillful argument of yesterday invested petitioner with an aura of irreproachability which I think is scarcely warranted by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.341" offset="244694">The facts that were before the Secretary of State, when he exercised his discretion to dismiss the petitioner were these.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.200" offset="284191">His counsel indicated, “When petitioner was on assignment with the army as a Foreign Service Officer during the war in China in 1944, it was his practice to prepare the usual Foreign Service reports.”</text>
            <text syncTime="60.581" offset="345736">The original of which was transmitted to the Secretary of State, other copies went to the Army and it was his practice to retain one copy in what he termed his personal file.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.146" offset="399966">The petitioner himself classified many of those reports as either confidential or secret, and that he was authorized to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.419" offset="441031">A year later, when petitioner returned to Washington, without making any effort to declassify those reports, without obtaining any clearance from any person in authority in the Secretary in the Department of State, he gave his copies of the Foreign Service reports to Mr. Jaffe.</text>

            <text syncTime="1409.443" offset="5741171">And if I may, by way of introduction, give the legal situation as it existed at the time that Mr. Acheson made his determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.620" offset="5777847">At that time, there were four statutes and one executive order, which gave Government employees a different classes, certain procedural protections with respect to their removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.978" offset="5835316">There was, of course, the Civil Service Act which covered employees in the classified Civil Service who might be removed to promote the efficiency of the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.743" offset="5878366">There was the Veterans' Preference Act, which gave similar protection to veterans in the Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.172" offset="5908041">There was the Foreign Service Act, which gave Foreign Service officers such as petitioner, a procedural protection of not being dismissed except pursuant to a hearing before a Board of Foreign Service officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.578" offset="5973661">There was, in addition, the Act of August 26, 1950, which this Court construed in Cole versus Young which authorized a dismissal in accordance with prescribed procedure of any employee in the interest of the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.956" offset="6043146">And finally, there was Executive Order No.9835 as amended which prescribed procedure for the handling of cases of doubtful loyalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.254" offset="6088391">Now, with all those procedures report, Congress, in the Appropriations Act for the State Department gave to the Secretary of State in these words, “The absolute discretion not withstanding the provisions of any other law to dismiss any officer or employee of the Department of State whenever he might deem not necessary or advisable in the interest of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.138" offset="6223914">Now, to us, Congress by that simply wiped out all the law with respect to procedural protection in the dismissal of employees in the Department of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.160" offset="6283995">It left those employees, strictly employees at will at the pleasure, if you please, of the Secretary of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.773" offset="6322448">Now, that of course is not really so remarkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.063" offset="6339584">For a hundred years in our Government, essentially, all employees in the executive branch held tenure or rather lack of tenure solely at the pleasure of the superior officer, the President or the officers under him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.028" offset="6415444">And indeed, today, the highest level of officials in the executive branch, hold office solely at the will, solely at the pleasure of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.602" offset="6469778">By this statute, as we see it, the relationship which obtained between Foreign Service officers and the Secretary of State was exactly as that which obtains between the President and the Secretary of State himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.407" offset="6536965">In other words, the President at any time is free to say to the Secretary of State, "You're doing a fine job but you don't get along with the press or you don't get along with Appropriations Committee, so you've got to go," and that's it, no notice, no charges, no proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.132" offset="6615855">And by this statute, the Foreign Service officers were placed in exactly that situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2898.105" offset="11695835">This Court will review for compliance with prescribed procedure and that only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.009" offset="11723421">The most striking case to illustrate that is the ever lying case in 257 U.S., where a man was dismissed form the Civil Service for taking bribes.</text>
