            <text syncTime="36.873" offset="250859">You may proceed, Mr. Searls.</text>

            <label>Mr. George B. Searls</label>
            <text syncTime="38.768" offset="258487">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.689" offset="270085">This case results from the refusal of the Supreme Court of the State of New York to order delivery to the Attorney General of property which the Attorney General, as successor to the Alien Property Custodian, had vested under the Trading with the Enemy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.999" offset="375411">The questions presented turn on the provisions of a trust indenture.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.619" offset="401847">On the provisions of a judgment entered in an earlier suit in 1948, as well as upon the judgment which is under review here.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.120" offset="459839">The property is held by the respondent Chase Bank under an indenture which was executed in 1928.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.169" offset="508008">The real settlor on the trust was the respondent Bruno Reinicke, although one Cobb was the nominal settlor.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.513" offset="561403">The trust is spendthrift trust for the primary benefit of Reinicke's children.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.961" offset="591182">And after the death of Reinicke and his wife, the property is to be divided equally among the children as they reach certain ages with provision for their children taking the share of any child who dies before the time of distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.232" offset="676342">Except as otherwise directed, the trustee is to accumulate the income for the lives of Reinicke and his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.467" offset="709256">But the indenture gave Reinicke authority to direct the payment of the income either to the children or to himself or to someone else for the benefit of the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.471" offset="769233">Also, if he notified the respondent, the bank that he had returned to the United States and was intended to become a resident, then he could direct the trustee to pay him personally half of the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.621" offset="845824">In addition, he had extensive powers of supervision over the management of the trust and over trust policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.676" offset="914056">Now, in 1945, the then Alien Property Custodian issued a vesting order number 4551 which is in the record at pages 67 to 72, in which he found that Reinicke, his wife and his children and a number of other people names were nationals of a designated enemy country, Germany.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.868" offset="1026800">And by that order, he vested, "All right, title, interest or claim -- and claim of each of the persons named and into the trust."</text>
            <text syncTime="246.081" offset="1087718">Acting on that vesting order, the Alien Property Custodian and later the Attorney General as his successor intervened in a suit for instructions which the trustee had brought in the Supreme Court of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.158" offset="1156054">And on the basis of the vesting order, the Government asked that the state court order the trustee to pay over the income to the Attorney General that an order also be made that the trustee deliver on the termination of the trust, the shares of the persons whose interest had been vested and also for a determination that by reason of the vesting order, he had succeeded to certain powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.473" offset="1297220">The Attorney General had succeeded the certain powers over the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.398" offset="1320939">The judgment went against the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.001" offset="1335359">It was entered on January 30th, 1948 and is in the record beginning at page 211.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.754" offset="1374438">The court held that the Attorney General had not succeeded to Reinicke's powers over the management of the trust or to his powers to direct the payment of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.206" offset="1432221">And that he was not entitled to receive the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.662" offset="1449984">As to those powers which had been subject to -- as to the powers which Reinicke had had to control the management and conduct of the trust, the court held that the trustee was authorized to administer the trust in his discretion for such period as Reinicke's powers should be subject to governmental control in the form of barking or other controls either in this country or in Germany.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.207" offset="1580178">On appeal, the Appellate Division affirmed saying that the vesting order did not indicate an intention to appropriate fiduciary powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.784" offset="1630542">The Court of Appeals of the State -- one judge dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.529" offset="1645484">The Court of Appeals of the State of New York affirmed without opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.675" offset="1666069">That was in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.533" offset="1681533">In 1953, April 6, the Attorney General amended vesting order 4551 and the amendment is in the record beginning at page 53.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.842" offset="1742764">The amendment struck out the right, title and interest vesting order and substituted what the case's term a recent vesting order.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.296" offset="1800547">That is the order stated that there is hereby vested in the Attorney General of the United States the trust property, that is the property which is described in the order as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.863" offset="1886856">"All property in the possession, custody or control of the respondent, Chase Bank, as trustee under the 1928 indenture.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="458.649" offset="1937951">Now again, that amendment in that order of April 1953, the Attorney General made findings, he found that Reinicke, his wife, the children and other persons named in the order were and had been prior to January 1, 1947 nationals of a designated enemy country, Germany.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.898" offset="2034918">And he also found that the trust property was property, which is and prior to January 1, 1947 was owned or controlled by and held on behalf of or on account of those enemy nationals.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.220" offset="2128227">The respondent, the Chase Bank, brought another suit for instructions in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in which it named as defendants the Attorney General, Reinicke, his wife, his children and other people who might be supposed to have some interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.287" offset="2216521">The complaint set up the 1948 judgment and alleged that the vesting of the trust fund, that is the 1953 vesting, was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.326" offset="2268662">The Attorney General answered that by the amendment, he had become entitled to the immediate possession of the property and he prayed judgment accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.854" offset="2322787">His answer also stated that the only relief that could be granted against the amendment was under the Trading with the Enemy Act in a District Court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.730" offset="2390288">The relief requested by the Attorney General was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.849" offset="2410768">The Court wrote a rather extensive decision, which is in the record beginning I think at page 150 and the short opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.952" offset="2459146">The Court held that the trustee was entitled to continue, to hold and administer the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.663" offset="2486000">It made findings that in the prior suit, the Attorney General had requested an order for delivery of the shares, which he had vested upon determination of the trust and that for a determination that he had succeeded to Reinicke's powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.350" offset="2580773">The Court also said that in the prior suit, the Attorney General had requested an order for the transfer of the principle on the ground that all interest in the trust had vested in him by reason of vesting order 4551.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.017" offset="2663424">The Court found, and I am speaking now still of the findings from the present suit, that the 1948 judgment decided that the powers claimed by the Attorney General were not vested in him.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.332" offset="2720684">It also made a finding that the respondent, infant-respondent, Hans Dietrich Schaefer is an American citizen born in 1953 and that he has a contingent interest in the trust and may become entitled to the entire fund upon its termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.982" offset="2815352">That judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division and the Court of Appeals of the State of New York, denied leave to appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="885.314" offset="3644583">Section 7 (c) provides that if the President shall so require, property which he has determined to be enemy owned shall be transferred to the Alien Property Custodian.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.919" offset="3691081">And Section 5 (b) as amended in 1941, said that any property shall vest when as and upon the terms prescribed by the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.370" offset="3772897">As we read the opinion and decision of the New York court, it seems to have gone upon two main grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.500" offset="3817409">The first place, it seems to have held or felt that the 1948 judgment in some way precluded the Attorney General's assertion of his rights in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.852" offset="3894732">That in some way that made his rights res iudicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.284" offset="3916466">And the second reason seems to have been the existence of the contingent claim of Schaefer to the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.968" offset="3963277">As to the first reason, it seems to us clear that this is not a case of res iudicata, cannot be.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.163" offset="4007999">In the primary sense of that term, that is -- and that the prior judgment is an absolute bar to this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.882" offset="4046869">And I say that because as we read the record and the cases, a cause of action or the claim in the prior suit and the cause of action and the claim here of the Attorney General are entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.021" offset="4123460">In the first suit, the Attorney General was proceeding on the basis of a right, title and interest vesting, by which he vested the rights of Bruno Reinicke and the other people mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.615" offset="4185840">And he claimed that he was entitled to whatever Reinicke was entitled to as a successor in interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.267" offset="4232443">In the two Zittman cases, this Court discussed the discussion between rights, title and interest in res vesting orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.074" offset="4275702">And in the second Zittman case, the Court said that by a right, title and interest vesting order, the custodian puts himself in the place of the person whose interest he has vested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.077" offset="4331708">And he leaves open to judicial determination what his rights are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.373" offset="4356890">Or as Judge Hand put it in Miller against Rau, one of the early cases under the Act, a right, title and interest order substitutes the Alien Property Custodian or the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.859" offset="4414777">And then he has to work out his rights under the will or as here under the trust indenture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.283" offset="4452498">The present suit however is a suit to enforce a res vesting order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.599" offset="4485726">The property vested by the amendment of 1953 is not the right, title and interest of Bruno Reinicke or of anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.787" offset="4526477">It is the property itself, all property in the possession, custody or control of the Chase Bank under the 1928 vesting order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.860" offset="4574856">And that distinction between the two types of vesting order also goes back to a language of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2187.111" offset="8851832">All those seem to say that where there is an assertion of the power to vest the res that the existence of a claim, even of a claim of a present interest to a property, is no defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.795" offset="8918601">That that has to be postponed to subsequent litigation under 9 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.352" offset="8940753">And it is difficult for me to see why a contigent claim should stand any better.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.672" offset="8974085">The reason of course is that Section 7 (c) of the Act says that the sole relief and remedy of any claimant shall be there provided by this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.339" offset="9016717">And that means a suit in equity under Section 9 (a) after the property has been turned over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.121" offset="9047855">The respondents argue however that a contigent remainderman's case is different that he doesn't have any effectual remedy under Section 9 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.541" offset="9097488">They say that is so for two reasons that the trustee may not maintain a suit under 9 (a) or at least may not recover because he has no beneficial interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.152" offset="9159973">And that the remainderman, the contigent remainderman, may not sue or at least recover under 9 (a) because of -- and his contigent interest can't be adjudicated or as one of the briefs puts it, he doesn't have ownership at the time of vesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.599" offset="9253804">The language of Section 9 (a) however, is about as broad as it could be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.445" offset="9281181">And we think it provides for the assertion of even a claim like Schaefer's.</text>

            <text syncTime="2321.797" offset="9390582">But at any rate, what Section 9 (a) says is, ‚ÄúAny person claiming any interest, right or title.‚Äù</text>

            <text syncTime="2393.340" offset="9676779">It has also said in several occasions that Section 9 (a) meets all constitutional requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.535" offset="9709484">We read those decisions to mean that if you have a property interest that is within the protection of the Constitution on the deprivation of property without due process of law or without just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.201" offset="9768208">That if you have such an interest no matter what it is, present or contingent, you can set it up in a suit under Section 9 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.880" offset="9818885">Now, when I was indicating a little while ago some doubt as to Schaefer's claim, what I had in mind was that in the analogous field of a taking by way of eminent domain, the cases have indicated that some reminders may be too remote, too contingent to be entitled to compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4006.851" offset="16130800">I am the guardian ad litem of this little American infant, Schaefer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.479" offset="16157236">And I must state that already it has been demonstrated here that he must object and defend his interest in this suit because the relegation to any other suit under the Trading with the Enemy Act will not furnish him adequate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4033.788" offset="16238529">And I -- if I may put it bluntly the relegation, cavalier fashion relegation to a suit under 9 (a) is only called comfort form as for Schaefer because if he comes into Court under a Section 9 (a) proceeding or after having exhausted the administrative remedies which are required and we did sought of merely out of caution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4060.904" offset="16346990">I filed the claim although I thought it was superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.926" offset="16367052">I now -- I'm for sure can recon with an objection on behalf of the Office of Alien Property that he does not have ownership of proposed proprietary rights at the present.</text>

            <text syncTime="4141.868" offset="16670804">And the New York court say that at present, the ultimate remainderman or beneficiaries are not ascertainable.</text>

            <text syncTime="4158.725" offset="16738304">At present, it can not be ascertained who has the ownership and control.</text>
            <text syncTime="4164.203" offset="16760142">We know only that much that the legal title is in the New York bank, the Chase National or the Chase Manhattan Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="4172.453" offset="16793161">It's an American bank and there is no any alien interest under any definition under the Trading with the Enemy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.154" offset="16823986">That is clear and nothing is going to happen to the trust and I want to preface my further remarks because I like to address myself principle to the question of constitutionality or vesting up to termination of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="4194.719" offset="16882291">Which I think is the ultimate and paramount question in connection with this present case before this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4205.262" offset="16924400">The interest, national interest of the United States are fully protected by the right, title and interest vesting order.</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.534" offset="16961494">Assuming arguendo for the -- for the sake of this present, my argument, that the right, title and interest vesting order covered or all interest -- all enemy interest in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4228.874" offset="17018859">Then it follows that nothing can happen to the trust until this right, title and vesting order has been cancelled the notes or the beneficiaries whose right, title and interest was vested, have come in under Section 9 (a) and have adjudicated the rights, title and interest or the right to reclaim the property as American citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4254.667" offset="17121991">In addition thereto, this trust is subject to Executive Order 8389 as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="4261.656" offset="17149994">In other words, everything is frozen and no penny can be paid out without any license.</text>
            <text syncTime="4269.390" offset="17180923">Now, this provision which was put in by Mr. Justice (Inaudible) adds an additional safety for the Attorney General and for the national interest, if you would -- if you please.</text>
            <text syncTime="4282.787" offset="17234526">It says that prior to any happening when there is an intention or a distribution and there is no other protection available for the United States' interest, the Attorney General got 60 days notice, and within the 60 days notice, the Attorney General has plenty of remedies available.</text>
            <text syncTime="4303.933" offset="17319058">It can go to the court by injunction, enjoin payment or something like that, and this is the 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="4310.939" offset="17347166">Now, the national interest being protected, what is behind this all res vesting order?</text>
            <text syncTime="4318.380" offset="17376841">And I like to paint a little bit about the background to the Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4324.011" offset="17399411">Well, we all know that war, the hostilities ceased in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="4329.434" offset="17421145">In 1948, this litigates -- the first round of this litigation took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="4336.686" offset="17450088">And the Court said that that is a continuing trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.444" offset="17465135">It will remain in the hands of the American trustee, Chase Bank, and it will be administered and nobody can get anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="4348.897" offset="17498990">Then it went to the Appellate Division and Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4354.002" offset="17519365">Five years later, only five years after the first adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="4359.573" offset="17541622">Meaning in 1953, n April 6, 1953, the Attorney General or rather should I put it a subdivision, an agency, Office of Alien Property decided that now is the time to vest the res.</text>
            <text syncTime="4374.360" offset="17600763">Now, whether that is a coincidence or not, I only like to relate to this Honorable Court to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4381.589" offset="17629706">On that time, that on or about middle of April, Chancellor Adner was supposed or -- and did in fact visit the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.916" offset="17671084">And it was rumored all around that one of the things that will be accomplished in connection with the visit that the United States Government will determine and decide to terminate vesting of German property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4407.351" offset="17732733">And indeed, this was proclaimed by the President, April 17, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.964" offset="17767215">That means, on the eve of this event where the President proclaimed an end to vesting of German property, the Office of Alien Property decided on the eleventh hour of five minutes to 12, decided to res vest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4434.775" offset="17842448">Now, I like to ask a rhetoric question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.489" offset="17857285">Where is the war urgency for such a measure?</text>
            <text syncTime="4443.597" offset="17877765">We know all what the purpose of the Trading with the Enemy Act is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4448.172" offset="17896051">It like -- it is for the purpose of depriving the enemy of resources and means to conduct a successful war and to augment our resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="4459.307" offset="17940564">In other words, to augment our war potential and reduce the enemies' war potential.</text>
            <text syncTime="4464.884" offset="17962924">That is the primary purpose of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4467.613" offset="17973791">Now, we have been told that there are some additional purposes, and one of these additional purposes is as they said that, "We have various obligations under international treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4484.430" offset="18041083">It is said that it should be used for satisfaction of claim of American citizens against Germany and so on."</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.521" offset="18073475">Now, I -- I like to answer this very arguments which are presented in the brief of the Attorney General with my own argument supported by an authoritative statement of the Secretary of State who refuted completely this type of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4510.934" offset="18147140">And although with -- I know that the report of Senate Committee on judiciary has no legal significance before this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4521.779" offset="18190503">It is not a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4523.771" offset="18198444">But if I may incorporate it into my argument to refute the argument that we have some obligations under international treaty that we must take the German, enemy property and keep, retain it, and properly confiscate.</text>

            <text syncTime="4656.960" offset="18731238">I believe Congress has the right to decide what to do about the matter and completely refutes these arguments which are advanced now for continuation of vesting after termination of state of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="4671.545" offset="18789543">Now, we had, after World War I, a similar situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4699.097" offset="18899780">The first resolution terminated war time legislation exempting therefrom from this, the Trading with the Enemy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.645" offset="18953906">And then came the second resolution which terminated the state of war but preserved the right to vest property which has been subject of vesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="4727.945" offset="19015137">And the cases after World War I held that if there was a vesting order already served.</text>
            <text syncTime="4735.045" offset="19043558">In other words, instead of using the strong hand as it is used in Paris courts, the demand was then already served upon the owner or possessor of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4745.731" offset="19086294">Then, the property can be retained by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4749.854" offset="19102804">If the demand order was served after that, no property can be retained because you can vest only property during time of war, and the war has officially terminated by Presidential Proclamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4764.047" offset="19159542">In this case, in -- after World War II, we have a similar situation whereby that is of a resolution, a joint resolution of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4774.422" offset="19201024">And then for the Presidential Proclamation of October, it was -- the -- the state of war between Germany and the -- and the United States was terminated but there was preserved the right of United States, a) to retain the property which had been already vested.</text>
            <text syncTime="4795.965" offset="19287228">And then it said, "Property which was subject to vesting on January 1stm 1947."</text>

            <text syncTime="4820.137" offset="19383881">If however, the order portion of this Saving Clause saying that you may still vest property which was subject to vesting prior to January 1st, 1947, has some power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4832.210" offset="19432260">I maintain that in this portion or the whole resolution to that extent, is unconstitutional because it is not in accord with the war power and it is not in accord with the very definition in the Trading with the Enemy Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="5218.222" offset="20976306">And I -- I think that in addition to the constitutional provision, we have provisions of international law, and I think that all although there are two of use, the prevailing view is that private property is not appropriated for war claims after the war is over.</text>

            <text syncTime="5269.518" offset="21181419">My distinguished opponent, Mr. Searls, tries to point out that it cannot be res adjudicata for the simple reason that we have here a different cause of action in the present litigation from the action or the affirmative relief requested by the intervening party, then also Attorney General, in the prior action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.569" offset="21285700">What is the cause of action if one claims property?</text>
            <text syncTime="5299.793" offset="21302523">I think the cause of action is exactly the same as the prior actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5305.226" offset="21324257">The cause of action of the ultmate operate fact underlying the claim or the action or the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5312.902" offset="21354977">These facts are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="5315.200" offset="21364172">And if I may suggest in order to avoid any labor, if you just oppose the specification of names and interest in the 1945 vesting order, with the specification and list of names of any in the interest in the 1953, you will find that the exactly the same names, exactly the same interest, were vested then as here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5340.560" offset="21465631">Now, why was there a necessity for amendment, why?</text>
            <text syncTime="5344.672" offset="21482036">I must add this that I am fully in accord with the Trading with the Enemy Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="5350.831" offset="21506696">I have written about it in publications but I am certainly opposed to administrative excesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5357.286" offset="21532505">And I think that the areas of this belated last minute deal to get the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="5363.677" offset="21558105">Now, I'd like to -- I'll answer also this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.715" offset="21570226">What is going to happen with the property when the vesting order is really brought into effect?</text>
            <text syncTime="5372.591" offset="21593736">The -- the result is that that the trust will be destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5377.290" offset="21612544">That's result number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5378.998" offset="21619336">Number two, the very expensive expenses of litigations will be subtracted or paid out of the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="5386.781" offset="21650474">The trust will lose its identity to go in a -- in a general account and it will not be more interest bearing or anything of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5396.591" offset="21689762">And yet, when we come to it, who has the present right to reclaim the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="5402.473" offset="21713272">Under 9 (a), we will have all the objections which have been advanced heretofore by the Attorney General about this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5410.044" offset="21743574">There is one more point I now -- that I am imposing upon the Honorable Court's patience.</text>
            <text syncTime="5416.946" offset="21771160">There is one more thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5418.813" offset="21778578">The Attorney General in his brief made a statement which I would ay is an incorrect statement.I wouldn't use any different qualification for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5429.261" offset="21820374">Here, we have dealings with predominantly prevailing, that is tautology used.</text>
            <text syncTime="5435.272" offset="21844511">German interest, that's not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5437.483" offset="21853288">First of all, the ultimate interest cannot be determined, it can be the American infant Schaefer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5444.822" offset="21882650">But I'd like to point out to you that the three children beneficiaries already -- the two boys, they're born here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5453.447" offset="21917132">They became American citizens by the -- by the fact of birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5457.705" offset="21934164">They were born in Cook County, Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="5461.652" offset="21949942">And when they were six and seven years, their parent went back to Germany and there is where they remained being infants before the World War II and they came back.</text>
            <text syncTime="5472.208" offset="21992155">And what I want to point out, what is the relevance of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5475.636" offset="22005948">The irrelevance is this that at the time of the issuance of the amended vesting order, all these three children were residents of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5487.088" offset="22051715">And the residents, at the time of the vesting order is the determining fact.</text>
