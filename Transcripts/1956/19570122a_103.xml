            <text syncTime="35.773" offset="246471">When the Court arose last Thursday, I had reached the threshold of the question which lies at the heart of this case, namely, whether a group of employers, who have been bargaining with a union on a multi-employer basis, may under the National Labor Relations Act lawfully suspend operations when the Union in support of its demands against all of the employers calls a strike against one of them for the purpose of bringing about a perpetually and threatens -- and threatens successive strikes against all the other employers for the purpose of bringing about the surrender of the group as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.688" offset="418147">As I stated last Thursday, the court below viewed the strike by the Union against one of the employer members of the association that is tantamount to a withdrawal by the Union from that relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.657" offset="469974">And therefore that on that basis, there was no distinction to be drawn between a lockout in the hands of an individual employer and a lockout in the hands of employers who are members of an association such as here.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.388" offset="520965">And that in either case, their lockout or suspension of operations is an unfair labor practice within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.046" offset="563597">As I also indicated last Thursday, we think that neither factually nor as a matter of law can the strike by the Union here against one of the members where it threatens successive strikes against all the other members of the association and where the Union has made no effort to withdraw from the multi-employer bargaining relationship that we think that neither factually here nor as a matter of law can the strike be regarded as equivalent or tantamount to a withdrawal by the Union from the preexisting here, then it is existing for some 13 years from the preexisting bargaining relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="550.263" offset="2304397">Now, the Board, by combining the term employer in Section 9 of the statute which deals with the certification of the bargaining units, combining that with the definition of employer in Section 2 -- in Section 2 of the statute and Section 2 of the statute, the old Wagner Act said that employer included those who acted in the interest of the employer directly or indirectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.684" offset="2398124">The Taft-Hartley statute defines the term employer as including those who are acting as agents for the employer directly or indirectly.</text>

            <text syncTime="625.897" offset="2607000">So now, the employers must enter in this arrangement voluntarily because their consent is essential under -- under the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="652.688" offset="2714102">On the other hand, the Union's consent to this arrangement, let me put it this way, that the Board will not certify a multi-employer unit unless there has been a history of this -- of this type of bargaining between the employer association and the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.421" offset="2801037">And whether there has been such a history, then the Board will not -- once it has certified such a unit, it will not permit the Union -- the Union to withdraw.</text>

            <text syncTime="1508.623" offset="6137814">Now, if I may explain now what Mr. Chief -- Justice Frankfurter has put into -- into a few words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.151" offset="6175953">Because I see the first consideration which we seek to place before this Court is that this multi-employer relationship presupposes that not only the collective bargaining agreements be at the group level but also that the contest be at the group level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.361" offset="6248782">As we have indicated in our brief, this type of bargaining is -- had been an accepted pattern in our industrial life, it's been accepted by many industries and as the authorities which we have collected in our brief indicate this type of bargaining offers, important advantages, not only to employers but to unions as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.533" offset="6337494">From the Union's standpoint, this type of bargaining permits them to achieve, as the authorities say, permits them to achieve a standardization of employment conditions which is an important labor objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.007" offset="6383365">And it also gives the Union a -- a greater degree of protection against being dislodged by a rival union, then would be the case if the contest between the Union and the rival union were on a single employer basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.319" offset="6436655">Now, on the other hand, this relationship also offers important advantages to the employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.768" offset="6466435">Perhaps, the most significant factor that predisposes employers to enter into this multi-bargaining relationships is that it is thought that this form of bargaining offers the most practical way from making the collective-bargaining process work in a real and meaningful sense as far as the employers are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.430" offset="6549086">This type of bargaining is found for the most part, most prevalent among employers, small and competing employers were found in metropolitan areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.744" offset="6594330">It's been estimated and some 70% of these multi-bargaining units are to be found among such employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.169" offset="6624005">And normally, these employers acting individually possess no substantial measure of bargaining strength as against the Union which represents all of the -- all of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.639" offset="6677922">And unless these employers are able to band together and present a united front to the Union, they have little or no room for any effective collective bargaining as against the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.231" offset="6732257">And from a very practical standpoint, their basic choice is either to enter into these multi-employer bargaining relationships where they can present a united front to the Union or simply they have no bargaining at all in any real or meaningful sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.320" offset="6796622">As one student of this subject who has had a very close and firsthand experience in these matters has said -- had said that in the absence of multi-employer bargaining, such as we have here, the unorganized employer has no bargaining strength or whatever when he acts alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.001" offset="6875408">The Union submits its demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.394" offset="6884916">If the lone employer does not exceed, he is closed by a strike, the Union diverts his employers to other jobs.If this cannot be accomplished, a small strike assessment on those continued work and finance strikers indefinitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.778" offset="6934444">The employer's competitors get his business, striking employers are at work elsewhere, the employer is soon the forgotten man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.536" offset="6957537">He has two choices to submit to the demands or to go out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.963" offset="6979271">Now, by entering into these multi-employer arrangements, the employers seek to redress this very obvious imbalance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.924" offset="7015111">They seek to pull their strength and one of their principal objectives is to meet concerted action of the employees with concerted action by the employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.302" offset="7056593">And by creating as -- in alignment of strength on both sides, they hope to gain a more effective voice in -- in the determination of their labor contracts and it would be the case if they were acting on an individual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.758" offset="7110405">They also hope to obtain a greater degree of stability and industrial peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.758" offset="7130363">But beyond these considerations, perhaps the most important consideration which makes for this type of bargaining insofar as the employer is concerned is a desire and a purpose to be free from being singled out by strikes, by the Unions while their competitors continue to remain in operation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2975.478" offset="12005334">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.145" offset="12027904">The question asked by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, it seemed to me to underscore the problem as the Board's position before this Court because while there is a considerable doubt, both reflected in the legislative history and by all of the writers in the field whether or not multi-employer bargaining is good at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.285" offset="12120482">This -- the Board is now asking this Court to make a legislative judgment that it is -- that multi-employer bargaining is not only good but it is so good that we're going to give them special privileges not accorded to the individual employer to encourage and foster this type of bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.082" offset="12203656">Now, I believe it's worthy of restating some of the basic facts because while the facts are briefed I think in this case, as in every case, they are crucial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.873" offset="12246915">There is an unincorporated association composed of eight or nine employers who are in the laundry and dry cleaning business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.291" offset="12288502">And their field of operations extends from Niagara Falls and Niagara County on the north through Buffalo and Erie County down to Dunkirk and Cattaraugus County, along the western pier of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.721" offset="12342209">And contrary to the opinion in the dissenting opinion below, this does not constitute the metropolitan area of the City of Buffalo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.725" offset="12378258">I don't know if the matter is crucial to this Court, but I think if it is, it's an often notorious and undisputed fact that it is not part of the metropolitan area of Buffalo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.990" offset="12423293">Furthermore, the exchange bargains with Local 449 who represents the truck driver employees also bargains with other unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.964" offset="12463208">So if it is at all crucial when we talk about 25 employees of each employer, we are only talking about 25 truck driver employees and we're not talking about those other employees who were engaged in the actual laundry and dry cleaning business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.442" offset="12537187">Now, in April of 1952, a collective bargaining agreement was entered into between Local 449 and the Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.136" offset="12583894">And the terms of the agreement affixed a one-year term with the 60-day notice substantially in the words of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.458" offset="12633213">The expiration date was April 30 of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.979" offset="12651290">The Union served its notice some time in February.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.270" offset="12664456">The employer served no notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.082" offset="12675741">So that some time in March, the Union began bargaining with the Exchange and the bargaining continued all the way through April, all the way through March, all the way through April until finally on the 26th day of May, there was a strike of the truck driver employees at Frontier Linen, one of the members of the Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.867" offset="12762885">And at that night, the Exchange and the individual employers who were its components said, "We're laying off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.544" offset="12797576">We, the non-struck employers, are laying off our employees.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.873" offset="12814817">“Why are you laying them off?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.291" offset="12820564">“We're laying them off because of the strike at Frontier.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.832" offset="12834670">“When would you let them go back to work?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.676" offset="12842088">“We'll let them go back to work when you stop that strike at Frontier and you withdraw the picket line at Frontier."</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.707" offset="12870196">The employers never claimed that any economic or operative problems existed at their plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.302" offset="12896632">They never asked the Union or anybody else or their own employees, do you intend to strike us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.565" offset="12925680">They didn't care.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.499" offset="12933413">Because if you'll read the record when the trial examiner asked the attorney for the Exchange, "Do you have something to say about this?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.694" offset="12962147">He said, "We -- we admit that we did what we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.554" offset="12977612">The only thing we say is that because we're a multi-employer unit, we have a right as a matter of law to do it."</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.028" offset="13007496">And perhaps that gets us to the heart of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.292" offset="13020557">Well then, during the ensuing week, the -- the Union and the individual employers asked this corporation, these various corporations, to let us go back to work in the same terms and conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.463" offset="13073220">And again, they were refused and again, the reason was given, “Not until you stop that strike at Frontier.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.038" offset="13099551">And they never asked the individual employees whether or not they ever voted for the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.565" offset="13121599">Now, this business about whipsaw and all this other successive and so forth seems to me to add nothing but -- but vituperative effort, that's to the whole matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.310" offset="13168619">The Second Circuit never agreed that there was any substantial evidence to support such a proposition of successive whipsawing so on and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.760" offset="13206444">Is it -- indeed the trial examiner found -- well, and we say this that the language of the Second Circuit was that I suppose that it was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.652" offset="13245942">It was reasonable because of the past history of bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.702" offset="13262137">It was reasonable to infer a threat to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.640" offset="13281886">But there's one other factor what seems to me to be of some significance and that is that there was the -- the trial examiner at record page 27, disturbs the basic premise of the Board's argument before this Court because the trial examiner, found at page 27 of the record in distinguishing this case from the Morand case and the Davis Furniture cases decided by the Seventh and Ninth Circuit respectively, he said, there was no evidence in the record to support the argument that the strike at Frontier was in support of demands common to all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.649" offset="13441964">I paraphrase them but I think the record substantially bears that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.948" offset="13459205">So there is no proof here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.875" offset="13466833">And this Court has before it the same record that the Board had before it, that the Second Circuit had before it and that the trial examiner heard, there is no proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.694" offset="13518137">And how can one extract from it and even allowing the Board, the expertness to which the Congress says it's entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.247" offset="13548335">How can they make such an inference of fact?</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.498" offset="13561396">Because there is nothing -- there is no facts there to support such an inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.480" offset="13581249">So we come then to the basic proposition that this was protected concerted activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.965" offset="13611238">And the trial examiner so found and the Board so found and that it was entitled to protection under the Act and there is an agreement between the parties at least that the activity of the non-struck employers in laying off there employees was unlawful because it's in clear violation of the language of Sections 8 (a) (1) and 8 (a) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.502" offset="13713429">8 (a) (1) because it interfered with concerted protected activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.891" offset="13730983">It's in violation of 8 (a) (3) because it's discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.214" offset="13748224">The argument that it's not discriminatory because you layoff all the employees is again the same threat of argument that if you do something in a large enough scale it somehow becomes all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.807" offset="13798588">It's the way they use to solve wage inequity problems in the old days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.605" offset="13817814">If someone complained about a wage inequity, they would cut everybody down to the lowest level and therefore, no inequity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.509" offset="13849370">And so here, lay them all off, therefore, no discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.727" offset="13870268">So then -- I don't want to -- to pass on problems that are not raised by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.641" offset="13897958">But I do think this question of the Board's experience is worthy of some comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.314" offset="13924603">Judge Harlan asked on Thursday if this matter had ever been considered by the Board before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.647" offset="13945919">Well, the -- my answer is yes, Your Honor, it was considered in the Morand case on remand very extensively by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.860" offset="13978833">It was considered in the Davis Furniture case by the Board extensively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.058" offset="13999626">It was considered by the Board extensively in Continental Baking Company case, a matter that came before the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.932" offset="14027107">It was considered by the Board as recently as August of 1956, the new Board, if we -- it can be so termed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.252" offset="14064410">And they had no trouble arriving at the problem that there was no equation between strikes and lockouts because if the Board -- if there is such an equation, then the result is obvious, the strike is foredoomed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.419" offset="14125014">The Board in its decision on the remand case from which I acquired heavily in my brief and recited that length in my brief said that the -- the equation of strikes and lockouts in the statute in every sense is used in a sense where strike activity is proscribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.954" offset="14207143">And to draw the inference that by proscribing lockouts in 8 (d), it makes all other lockouts lawful by the same token, one can say, that all other strikes are lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.329" offset="14256671">And while a reductio ad absurdum applies in both cases and I think it is a valid argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.445" offset="14281122">Because if the Court is asked to say that all other lockouts are legal, then all other strikes are legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.048" offset="14311528">But in -- an examination of the legislative history it shows that what was really intended, if any clear intent can be defined from 8 (d), was that according to Senator Ball, we want to prevent quickie -- “quickie strikes."</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.889" offset="14382895">And as the same expression of intent is reflected by Senator Taft, what we want to do is not to impair the right to strike, but what we want to do is to preserve that right until after there has been a reason of a lot of opportunity for the parties to reconcile their differences which was the same expression that there are the same feeling that Senator Taft had throughout his dissatisfaction with the way the unions themselves were constituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.966" offset="14499192">And he felt that by imposing a waiting period that the matter would be more amicably resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.766" offset="14534405">The Board adopts another thesis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.437" offset="14549138">They say that if the multi-employer unit doesn't have the right to strike out, to lock out, then they'll all be destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.099" offset="14599816">But there is no proof in the records that these employers were economically weak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.768" offset="14618415">He never claimed any such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.822" offset="14626670">He never said that there was any accretive problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.283" offset="14640462">They just said that they've got a right to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.038" offset="14651538">And the -- the hypothetical that Mr. Justice Black posed in saying that they were just going to improve their bargaining position by locking out is not before this Court at all because they never said that that was their purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="3719.347" offset="14980786">But I think in the Steel Strike, for example, it's traditional that the steelworkers leave somebody behind so if they're going to shut the thing down, the whole capital equipment of the employer isn't going to be destroyed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3739.708" offset="15062183">Now, if an employer faced with such a problem as that, I think that they are present in a somewhat different situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="5279.029" offset="21219453">And everyone seems to be agreed including the Board that this is an unfair labor practice except for the fact that there is a multi-employer group involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5290.287" offset="21264488">And our position has been and is now that there is nothing mystical about a multi-employer group and that's the long and the short of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.135" offset="21307956">Furthermore, we say that the most that can be taken from a reading of the -- the legislative history is, and I use the word tolerated which perhaps there are better ones, but they did nothing to disturb it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5316.411" offset="21368978">The House majority report was going to disturb the issue and all these arguments directed to reciting the long history of multi-employer bargaining long before the Wagner Act or any of the other legislation of the late 20's and 30's that there was multi-employer bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="5341.425" offset="21469080">The House majority reports said, we don't care that if it's worked out and if some dislocations occur as a result of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5348.994" offset="21499382">It's bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="5350.212" offset="21504188">And the reason that it's bad, at least to one that I submit is the most cogent, there are number of other reasons advanced, but the most cogent one to me, advanced, I'm not saying whether I agree with it, that's not my burden now to say that multi-employer bargaining is good or bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="5365.086" offset="21563747">But with the House majority report and those, the more persuasive arguments submitted, was that it is going to bring the Government deeper and deeper into this multi-employer bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="5378.893" offset="21618918">We can note this as a judicial fact, as a matter of judicial notice that the steel unions bargained last year with United States Steel, Bethlehem and the rest of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="5401.831" offset="21710660">By the Board's reasoning, if next year in the bargaining or at the next time that they do bargain, the Union strikes only United States Steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5411.139" offset="21747963">The Board says to the Union, you might as well strike them all because if you don't, they have the right to lay you off anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="5417.704" offset="21774190">Now, this was the type of thing that Congress was much distressed about.</text>
            <text syncTime="5421.874" offset="21790908">And Senator Ives and Senator Morris felt that -- there were others too, but it seemed to me that the main proponents of -- of permitting the status quo said that it's worked out pretty well in many circumstances and we ought to leave well enough alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="5440.174" offset="21864051">And I quoted very extensively from what -- in my brief from what Senator Ives said.</text>
            <text syncTime="5445.272" offset="21884426">Senator Ives admitted, perhaps not the ignorance of Congress but the not knowingness of Congress about this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5454.540" offset="21921520">And there, they said that we are setting up Section 402 of Title IV for the specific reason of finding out why and how this thing works and that there are other authorities who say that no generalization can be made about multi-employer bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="5475.754" offset="22006366">I've quoted some of them here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5478.337" offset="22016711">But I should also like to call the Court's attention to this report made by this special committee, set up under Title 402 of the Act and it's not in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5488.900" offset="22058924">It's 80th Congress -- 80th Cong., 2nd Sess., Rep.No.986, Pt.5, and this was after an investigation of the west coast experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="5502.042" offset="22111587">It's Rep.No.986 of the 80th Cong., 2nd Sess.</text>
            <text syncTime="5506.833" offset="22130709">And I quote from their conclusion, "Multi-employer bargaining has in different industries than both an instrument of peace and of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="5516.621" offset="22169893">In some context and some environments, it has been conducive to the preservation of industrial peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="5524.314" offset="22200613">While in other instances, the opposite result has been produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="5528.573" offset="22217644">The conclusion seems inevitable that it is not multi-employer bargaining which has produced either result."</text>
            <text syncTime="5536.926" offset="22251081">So, whatever the great authorities in the field seemed to feel about how good multi-employer bargaining is the only evidence that we have from this committee set up under Title 402 is that the results are inconclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="5553.211" offset="22316178">And other matters that they say is that there are not as many strikes in the multi-employer bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="5559.207" offset="22340211">Well, that -- perhaps Congress isn't so impressed by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5561.937" offset="22351078">Maybe they -- Congress would look at the magnitude and the economic dislocation of one strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="5567.524" offset="22373439">Perhaps to use -- since all of these arguments bristle with phrases of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="5573.241" offset="22396322">Perhaps, the Congress feels that a number of police actions are better than one major catastrophe.</text>
            <text syncTime="5579.746" offset="22422340">I submit at least that that's the possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="5582.508" offset="22433416">But I -- that the bone and contention of my argument is that whether multi-employer bargaining be good or bad is for the Congress to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="5592.772" offset="22474480">And Congress, as I say, has said neither, it's allowed it to continue but the Congress never said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5600.185" offset="22504155">The Congress never said it's so good that we're going to allow an employer to lockout his employees solely because he becomes a member of that group.</text>
            <text syncTime="5610.332" offset="22544697">I say that what the Congress felt was that they're -- they're to be treated just like everybody else and if -- if there are some benefits which they can gain from this form of bargaining, fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="5621.154" offset="22587956">If there's some that they -- if they feel that it is now become unsatisfactory, let them withdraw.</text>
            <text syncTime="5626.611" offset="22609795">I say that the same reasoning applies to unions and that's the long decision, the long part of this decision that Justice Frank in -- in his decision in the Second Circuit was alluding too.</text>
            <text syncTime="5638.853" offset="22658800">He said that -- and that he was -- the bone of his contention was is this, his decision is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="5646.067" offset="22687640">This activity by the Union is protected, concerted activity, strike activities, concerted activity and this Court has said so that it is protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="5655.455" offset="22725151">Nobody has ever said to the contrary, the trial examiner so found, the Board so found and the Second Circuit accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5662.461" offset="22753259">This activity does layoff of the employees is a clear violations of the plain language of 8 (a) (1) and 8 (a) (3) of the Act.</text>
