            <text syncTime="29.833" offset="222751">This is a derivative stockholders' suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.963" offset="243231">Federal jurisdiction is claimed on the basis of diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.128" offset="267891">Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit decided that the principal corporation involved here had to be realigned as the plaintiff rather than as the defendant and that if the corporation was thus realigned, diversity of citizenship was absent and jurisdiction was defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.058" offset="367574">We, the plaintiffs petitioned for certiorari on the ground that the alignment rule, stated by the Court of Appeals, the jurisdictional rule annunciated by this Court of Appeals was in conflict with earlier decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.769" offset="438418">And we petition for certiorari on the further ground that the manner in which the Court of Appeals acted in the premises with respect to the condition of the record and the status of the case as it was in the Court of Appeals we claim that in the manner in which it acted, the Court of Appeals so far departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings as to require the exercise of the supervisory powers of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.322" offset="560671">Now, Your Honors, I wanted to emphasize that, that we are here both because we claim a conflict between the rule applied by the Court of Appeals with earlier decisions of the Supreme Court and also that we have serious objections to the manner in which the case came to decision in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.291" offset="648547">I want to emphasize that because in the statement of the case which I am now about to make, I will be perhaps a little more detailed about the procedural history of the case than might otherwise be true because it all has a bearing upon the status of the case in the Court of Appeals at the time that that court acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.561" offset="729631">And so, if the Court please, I'd like now to, in stating the case, to make some references to the record and I may say that the record as prepared and printed here in -- in the hands of this Court is the same record which was before the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.921" offset="815104">And part of our objections will relate to the fact that we think that this record was inadequate for the purposes to which it was put in the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <label>Mr. James E. Doyle</label>
            <text syncTime="202.356" offset="912802">Now, this action as I have said was -- is a stockholders' derivative suit and the complaint in the action is set forth in the record here beginning at page 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.210" offset="956165">The -- the gist of the evil complained of in the complaint and it's -- and it's set out here at length, that I'll be brief about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.977" offset="995244">The gist of the fraudulent conspiracy alleged here is that the complaint says that certain of the defendants who were officers and directors of the corporation, that is the Chicago North Shore Railway Company, certain officers and directors who are made defendants and some who are not made defendants here conspired with others who had knowledge of the fraudulent equality of the conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.749" offset="1110392">They conspired to buy up certain bus properties through intermediate corporations which they control to buy up these bus companies cheap and to resell them dear to their own corporation, realizing a profit on that transaction that's alleged of about a million and a quarter dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.080" offset="1191685">That is the wrong complained of by the stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.593" offset="1209762">Now, the stockholders set forth in their complaint here that they went to the corporation, went to -- went to those in control of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.810" offset="1250617">In 1949, these wrongs alleged had -- had occurred over a period from about 1945 to 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.059" offset="1291577">The plaintiffs went to the board of directors of the corporation, the Railway Company in 1949 and they demanded that this action be brought by the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.345" offset="1340792">At pages 6 and 7 of the record, the Court will observe the allegations of the complaint with respect to the -- this demand and what the result of the demand was.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.959" offset="1395231">And those allegations are extremely important for purposes of testing the ultimate jurisdictional rule applied by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.517" offset="1437445">But to summarize those, I may say that the -- the allegations on page 6 and 7 of the record, the allegations and the complaint, do comply fully, we assert, with the requirements of Rule 23 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.433" offset="1509125">They do contain all of the necessary allegations required by that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.961" offset="1531173">They alleged that these -- this complaint alleges that the demand was made upon this board of directors, that the corporation bring the action, that the demand was refused, that even had the corporation commenced the action under those circumstances, control of the action would have been in hostile hands that this -- that this action is founded on allegations of fraudulent conspiracy joined in by several members of the Railway Company's present board of directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.331" offset="1652694">That the secure action by the stockholders would have required a proxy fight with management in order to elect a new board of directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.745" offset="1698356">That the Railway Company's side of that proxy fight would be financed by the Railway Company and the general allegation required by Rule 23 (b), that this action is not a collusive one and designed to confer jurisdiction on the federal courts, which they would not otherwise enjoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.456" offset="1777246">Now, the body of the complaint, pages 8 on through 17, contains detailed description about the -- the interlocking relationships among the various defendants, business, and social, and family ties of these various people.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.621" offset="1853837">And the complaint does allege at page 8, in paragraph 8, that all of the defendants herein are related to the three dominant defendants who are named there by natural ties or close business and social connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.105" offset="1919770">Now, those are the allegations of -- of the complaint which later became important as the case proceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.872" offset="1954879">That complaint was filed in January of 1950 and I may say here that the plaintiffs are individual citizens of the State of Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.777" offset="2014438">The principal corporation involved, the Railway Company, is a citizen of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.654" offset="2042023">The individual alleged wrongdoers, I'll refer to them as the -- as the wrongdoers, individual wrongdoers, are citizens of the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.773" offset="2090506">Among this group of alleged wrongdoers, there were two corporations as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.163" offset="2108061">One of them, an Indiana Corporation and another, a Delaware Corporation both of which were licensed to do business in Illinois and amenable to process there.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.539" offset="2141497">And I believe that I do know violence to the issues here when -- for purposes of simplification, I say, that the action was brought by citizens of Nevada, these minority stockholders against individual citizens of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.813" offset="2202624">And the principal corporation; the Railway Company, joined as a defendant, citizen of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.017" offset="2227388">And therefore, on the alignment as it appeared in the complaint, there was complete diversity and -- of citizenship, and federal jurisdiction obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.099" offset="2271796">Now, that complaint was filed in January 1950, in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, in January of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.976" offset="2319235">In December of 1950 some of the defendants made a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.940" offset="2351104">That motion to dismiss that is set forth in the record and as stated, and as argued at that time in the District Court the motion raised several questions, including among those possibly pertinent here, including the question of collusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.186" offset="2424142">That motion said -- the motion asserted that there had been collusion between these plaintiffs, citizens of Nevada and those in charge of the Railway Company to -- by which the Railway Company defined to take the action and the Nevada citizens brought it, and that that was a collusive effort to -- to infer a jurisdiction upon the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.135" offset="2523930">Now, that motion to dismiss was briefed and argued, and then after a considerable discussion and consideration, the District Court over which Judge Barnes then presided, overruled the motions to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.121" offset="2595819">He filed no written memorandum but he stated his opinion from the bench and the pertinent portion of that opinion appears at pages 3 and 4 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.488" offset="2633331">And I invite the Courts attention to that opinion, near the bottom of page 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.178" offset="2656110">I won't -- although, it's brief, I won't read it but I -- I think if the Court will glance at it you will see that what Judge Barnes said in effect was that he was not going to decide the question of collusion or the question of realignment at that stage of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.341" offset="2724760">That instead he felt that the issues, the factual issues that underlay those questions should be tried out fully in the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="681.988" offset="2831339">Now, Judge Barnes indicated that the appropriate -- that that was not the appropriate time to decide these questions and that they should be tried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.206" offset="2868224">But he entered that order, overruling the motion to dismiss in May of 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.793" offset="2898526">And he directed the defendants to answer and said that they could raise this same -- the same objections in their answers, which they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.800" offset="2938546">Thereafter, and -- and during this interval there was considerable pretrial work and -- and efforts to -- to clarify the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.200" offset="2980133">But in December of 1953, that's almost four years after this action had been commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.549" offset="3013569">In December of 1953, one of the defendants who had not previously moved for dismissal then moved for dismissal, December of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.509" offset="3061426">And the court granted that defendant permission to move for dismissal at that time and then granted the motion for dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.885" offset="3098937">By that time a District Judge was presiding -- a different judge was presiding in the District Court, Judge Knoch.</text>
