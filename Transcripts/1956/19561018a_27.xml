            <text syncTime="9.872" offset="142817">Mr. Sprowl, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. James A. Sprowl</label>
            <text syncTime="11.964" offset="151280">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.412" offset="164968">When we adjourned last evening, I had just referred to a memorandum of the defendants including Howes Leather Company and Montgomery Ward by Judge La Buy below, in support of a motion to strike the amended complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.749" offset="234350">They said it will be next to impossible for this Court to try the case, as the pleading now stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.200" offset="256188">The trial will be reminiscent of a battle royal.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.414" offset="273011">There are 104 plaintiffs and 10 defendant manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.441" offset="285132">Considered as price discrimination case, there are 1040 separate distinct and unrelated price discrimination claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.695" offset="318151">There may be 10 in each count, from count two through count 105.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.198" offset="336123">Each plaintiff was shown, not only the price in which purchases were made from a manufacture by a defendant department or a chain store in competition with him, he must also show that he'd want to go to like a greater quality from the same seller at a higher price and that the effect thereof was to substantially less than competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.883" offset="418879">The trial would be fantastically complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.799" offset="430582">And in their brief, they underlined the words "fantastically complicated."</text>
            <text syncTime="87.744" offset="454301">Now, the number of counts remains the same less one, 104 counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.127" offset="475930">However, there will only be 87 counts to try because some of the plaintiffs have been dropped by the wayside for one reason or another, but at least some 600 separate claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.309" offset="528593">The type of evidence in this type of case, of course, will be tedious and documentary.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.832" offset="558686">At the hearing, just preceding the reference to the master, the plaintiffs' lawyer stated, and it's in the record, he did have to fire -- hire eight express stenographer just to answer the defendant's interrogatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.979" offset="619290">Judge La Buy mentioned in the same hearing that he thought he'd heard more motions in this case as Rohling case than in any other case he ever had.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.668" offset="662026">And the -- the docket which is set up in the record, covers 28 large pages of just the entries of the orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.968" offset="699225">Judge La Buy has become quite familiar with the general scope of the case and has written six opinions of which four of them reported, one, in 15 federal rules decisions striking the original complaint, dismissing certain defendants, quashing certain services, 17 federal decisions overruling a motion to strike the second amended complaint, that's the one we're here of.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.484" offset="817298">20 federal rules decisions allowing Howes Leather Company and their motion to inspect certain agreements to dismiss, entered into by the plaintiffs or other defendants to see if they didn't, perhaps, release them.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.085" offset="871737">And in 20 federal rules decisions there's a -- two opinions refusing summary judgements to two defendants, I think Armour &amp; Company and Gold Glass.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.557" offset="933595">The basis for that was they claim they had not made any sales to the -- the plaintiffs but the Court pointed out they were charged with conspiring with others.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.128" offset="979884">So nothing could be decided on summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.530" offset="1001514">I think the record shows that Judge La Buy knew the scope of this case when he made these references, had done a great deal of work in it and that it is a very unusual, complex case involving a peculiar kind of tedious, probably uncontroversial testimony, consisting largely of records of sales.</text>

            <text syncTime="269.717" offset="1182281">The judge said two months and I think that's a fair estimate.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.083" offset="1255737">There isn't any impossibility of their paying.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.255" offset="1300355">If -- if the judge insisted on referring a case and one of the party says, “I can't pay” so there couldn't be any decision, that's a different cast than this.</text>

            <text syncTime="391.019" offset="1667427">Before the -- the present rule was adopted, the master could attach for his fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="398.542" offset="1697520">He collects them like any other creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.776" offset="1710477">Now, let's take that part, because I think the court below had the idea that if the only agreed cases could be referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.261" offset="1748407">Now, of course, you never have any trouble about that if everybody agrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.831" offset="1762722">I participated on that when nobody objects.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.678" offset="1782053">However, the rule provides farther on that there may be references.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.792" offset="1830536">It -- it clearly implies that there can be references from absent agreement because Rule 53 (e) (4), part of the same rule provides, "the effect of a master's report is the same whether or not the parties have consented to the reference”.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.560" offset="1905664">Now, that was put in there, I think, because of the Armour's case, where there used to be, long ago, a difference in the finality of the findings where it was a consent reference and where it wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.805" offset="1954565">What this obviously indicates and contemplates references absent consent, if you can't read it otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.006" offset="1983404">Now, actually, if the rule is to be helpful to the Court, and I'm speaking now from the point of view with the trial court, consent should not be important because the case he finds he needs to refer and calls for it on his nature may be one where somebody doesn't wish to have it referred.</text>

            <text syncTime="900.256" offset="3704351">I don't think there's any prohibition in this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.718" offset="3718248">Certainly, there isn't of general references.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.974" offset="3727235">They are used, they are contemplated, there is some special authority for limited issue references and Mr. Morris says on this, the scope of the reference maybe defined by the order of reference but is indicated by the use of the word "may" in the rule and the general grant of power given by the second sentence of subdivision (c) a reference containing no limitations is a general reference to report all the issues both the law in fact involved in a litigation, and most references are general references.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.032" offset="3851473">That's my comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.301" offset="3860564">The exceptional condition can't be limited to consent references that I think the court below would like to do, because the rule contemplates references without consent as I've already pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.132" offset="3915943">That the special condition can't be matters of account because all are specially provided for.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.236" offset="3940289">There isn't any limitation in the rule as to what type of circumstances the Court should consider but they must be exceptional.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.645" offset="3973935">The lower courts and we review these cases, since the -- this really goes back to 1912, when they adopted the equity rules which are practically these same rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.992" offset="4011342">Some differences but not in the most part (Inaudible0, and they have always considered congestion is one circumstance that could be from time to time considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.190" offset="4056168">There are some cases to the contrary including the one we're reviewing.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.494" offset="4085321">Now, the Court -- the Circuits have disagreed a little bit as to whether this exceptional circumstance must be inherent in the case or can be extraneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.329" offset="4124714">In Kirkpatrick, the Third Circuit case and if we're doing the admiralty rule said the things must be inherent in the case, in the nature of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.038" offset="4159509">You couldn't consider the death of a judge or congestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.431" offset="4173093">Perhaps, that's what's meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.607" offset="4177795">I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.993" offset="4183333">Other -- other courts such as our Circuit seem to think it should be extraneous are not in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.025" offset="4207470">That the case can't be in its nature such that it would be justified reference unless it's an accounting case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.945" offset="4235160">I think that both types should be considered, each case judged on its own and -- and either way you look at in this case, both the internal and the external circumstances were present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.505" offset="4293360">Now, the judge -- the judges below did some reasoning and I -- I can't follow this reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.984" offset="4315303">It seems in like (Inaudible) to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.135" offset="4323871">It says that in jury cases, this is a footnote to the majority claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.075" offset="4339649">Only complicated cases can be referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.574" offset="4353651">Now, of course, the jury thing came in with ex parte Peterson in the early 20s but under the immediate predecessors of these rules substantially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.463" offset="4397223">And they were justifying for the first time, the use of a -- of a master in a jury case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.169" offset="4416031">Now, obviously, the only reason for using it in the jury case is because it's too complicated for a jury, they want to straighten these accounts out a bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.335" offset="4448737">That is the rational of that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.142" offset="4467963">The fact that that is the kind of a case that can be referred to a jury case, shouldn't at all mean that you couldn't consider the complication of the case in an equity case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.449" offset="4513207">That's the only kind of a jury case that can be referred and I think that's proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.037" offset="4531493">Otherwise, your right to a jury trial becomes infringed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.744" offset="4550301">But the complicated cases have been the more common subjects of reference usually as the Court -- as our Court of Appeals said in that Adventures of Good Eating case that Mr. Levy quotes and the majority quotes and -- and what Judge Evans, who was a fine judge, used some good language in showing some of the evils of master's references, said there should have been one in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.125" offset="4659911">But that was a simple case and the reason he said it was, it only took eight hours to hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.273" offset="4680495">Well, the judge could have heard it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.864" offset="4694810">The -- the -- what the judge says about a case that takes eight hours to hear, hardly should be applied, without at least some second thought and the case is going to take two months and involves 100 parties, each would claims against the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.178" offset="4772133">Now, the complicated cases in equity are referred for a different reason in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.882" offset="4790941">It isn't because the judge can't handle them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.820" offset="4798673">Obviously, he can do better than his master.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.509" offset="4809435">It's because, as Judge Hand said, in the Pennsylvania Railroad Number 32 case, which we cite in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.328" offset="4844648">And -- and he said that the -- that the equity complicated case is referred because it takes a long time to hear and it's tedious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.449" offset="4881220">And it saves the judge's time and lets them get on with their business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.303" offset="4904626">I think it shouldn't be forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.102" offset="4919777">Now, is -- the court below seemed to think that, as I read their footnote, that -- that you can refer more jury cases now than non-jury case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.131" offset="4955930">You can't refer complicated case in equity but you can at law with the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.460" offset="4981217">Well that seems ridiculous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.764" offset="4994382">Moore states that although, he says Rule 53 makes provisions for master and both jury and non-jury actions although, its chief use will be on non-jury actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.809" offset="5046627">The court below doesn't seem to agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.287" offset="5056554">And in ex parte Peterson where this Court authorized the use of a master, in a law case, in a jury case, the Court said this 253 U.S. at page 314, "But no reason exist."</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.582" offset="5113710">Now, owing to the differences in the character of the proceedings and of the questions ordinarily involved, the occasion for seeking such aid as is afforded by special masters' orders and examiners arises less frequently at law, than in equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.353" offset="5172746">Well I think that's everybody's experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.191" offset="5180165">We -- we never have reference in a jury case in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.715" offset="5194271">I never heard of one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.671" offset="5206079">And now, on the same case, ex parte Peterson, this Court said, "But no reason exists while a compulsory reference to an order simplify and clarify the issues and make tentative findings, may not be made at law when occasion rises as freely as compulsory references to special masters remain in equity."</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.873" offset="5278908">It's in -- in the non-jury cases that the references should be the more frequent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.232" offset="5304299">Now, then, why did the Court -- here's a discretionary order, it seems to be very reasonable, made by a judge who was very familiar with the case and had special problems because of du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.976" offset="5359261">And why did they vacate it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.216" offset="5364276">Well they did it because they thought this Court simply had to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.128" offset="5375875">That's what they say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.789" offset="5382562">And they -- and they may base it on McCullough versus Cosgrave which in turn based on the James case that Judge Frankfurter mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.926" offset="5411088">Now, in the James case, and in the McCullough case, the charges seemed to be very parallel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.884" offset="5438882">They charged that there was, in -- in effect, an agreement, a concert among the judges in a certain district in California to refer practically all patent cases to masters, to a master, a standing master, who heard nothing else and that they referred no other type of cases and they were discriminating against patent litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1688.283" offset="6856495">And Roche and Bankers both condemned the efforts of Courts of Appeals to review interlocutory orders by using these extraordinary writs particularly mandamus and thereby, just slipping around at the end of the congressional bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.725" offset="6922324">Now, it's important that they not be encouraged to interrupt.</text>

            <text syncTime="1716.767" offset="6970389">Now, they might have had to pay some thousands of dollars to get the masters hearing but the case would have probably been decided if this hadn't occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.901" offset="7006960">And that evil is very eloquently discussed in the (Inaudible) case in the Third Circuit by Judge Goodrich or he -- he says talking now about forms now inconvenience reviews that they're going to just ruin the rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1750.008" offset="7103404">Now, I've already said that I have a good opinion of our Court of Appeals and there's a good feeling in the Circuit and there's no heat in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.608" offset="7145827">But, having said that, I want to say that I think the -- that our Court of Appeals does think it can review any order at once that it considers wrong by mandamus and I will rely on the two cases it cites for its right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.517" offset="7209462">And those were the two cases against Judge Igoe and filed in the Chicago Rock Island &amp; Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.161" offset="7228061">One is the 212 F.2d 378 and both of them are subsequent to the Roche and Bankers Life decisions in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.904" offset="7267035">In that case, at page 380, the objection made to the issues of mandamus was the same as we're making, stated and this is from the Court's opinion, stated in the light most favor to respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.006" offset="7319385">The contention is that the granting or denying of a motion to transfer rests in a sound discretion of the trial court and the mandamus will not lie to review its disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.698" offset="7354180">So let me discuss Roche and Bankers and decide they can do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.681" offset="7374137">They -- they that decided those don't stop them and they -- then they have remanded it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.871" offset="7394826">In this case, Judge Igoe had refused to send the case to another more convenient jurisdiction or one alleged to be over in Iowa, but he hadn't considered or the Court felt he hadn't considered the true ground specified in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.353" offset="7456789">So, they remanded the cause of the District Court with directions to vacate the order and to reconsider petitioner's motion in the light of the views herein expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.291" offset="7492524">Then they said, on the decision on that motion is within the promise of the District Court and we cannot as petitioner would have us do, usurp its function and decide the question in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.048" offset="7539545">But what have they do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.983" offset="7543306">Judge Igoe went back and heard it again including some new facts, including that the plaintiff had moved to Chicago and married a Chicago man or something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.150" offset="7579982">He refused the transfer and they issued another mandamus and made him transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.206" offset="7600149">And in that case, now this is the second time they certainly are controlling as to discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.500" offset="7629406">The -- the -- Judge Finnegan wrote a rather cogent dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.276" offset="7652498">He was all alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.283" offset="7656469">It was an en banc decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.397" offset="7669008">And he said, he refer -- use these words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.709" offset="7702235">That they were currently usurping the District Court's function to decide in the question in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.251" offset="7724387">I think we now usurp where we once refrained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.825" offset="7738702">If we are substituting our discretion for that of respondent, we ought to say so and be done with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.475" offset="7761272">I think they did in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2079.464" offset="8421230">The first, Justice Frankfurter asked about any tendency in the Seventh Circuit to refer cases to masters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.619" offset="8457801">And Mr. Sprowl made reference to a case in which a judge said that there was some practice of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.011" offset="8499388">Well, that case is Krinsley versus United Artists Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.769" offset="8522480">It was decided on July 19th, 1956, and the judge who made that statement is the Chief Judge of the Seventh Circuit writing for a unanimous court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.238" offset="8588309">And what he said was, that references to masters are a practice all too common in the Northern District of Illinois.</text>

            <text syncTime="2252.006" offset="9111385">The question was asked as to what is the additional expense in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.783" offset="9146493">The additional expense is, first of all, the master's fee and incidentally I know that the master's fee in the Krinsley case was $30,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.878" offset="9206888">And I know all too well that although there had -- were never any proceedings before the master in this case, that pursuant to the order that he had the right to require the posting of security for his fees and the parties were called upon to post cash in the amount of $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.776" offset="9298526">Neither Montgomery Ward &amp; Company nor Howse Leather Company posted anything because of our objection to the reference and I don't know whether any of the other parties just what they did in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.768" offset="9354428">But that's not the only additional expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.186" offset="9372087">There is the expense of the court reporter which is extremely substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.928" offset="9391104">In our District Courts in Chicago, when we try a case, we have the services of the official reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.026" offset="9423496">And if I want part of the transcript, I order what I want and I pay for it, but that's all I pay for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.801" offset="9454529">I don't pay for the recorder's time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.297" offset="9464560">And ordinarily, in Chicago, our District Judges don't ask for a transcript of all of the testimony at the trial, and if they do, there is authority to the effect that the District Judge has a right to ask of the official reporter a transcript for his personal use without any additional compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.573" offset="9549615">In this case, Master Collin made it very clear at the outset that it would be his reporter, his choice of reporter who would take the -- the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.986" offset="9595277">Another element of expense is the expense of Attorney's fees because when you try a case before a master, you try it, you brief it, you argue it, and the master issues his report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.951" offset="9667166">And then you go to the District Court and you brief it, first you have your delousing party files as objections to the report and you brief it and you argue it and you're really arguing it before a sort of intermediate appellate court because when you get before the District Judge, this master's findings are not reversible unless they are clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.381" offset="9776880">And that was the very point of the two appeals in Krinsley because when the first one came up, the Court of Appeals said, “You say the master is wrong, but you don't tell us exactly how.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.883" offset="9826931">And then when it came up the second time, the trial judge had told them exactly how.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.349" offset="9848769">So that there are these additional Attorney's fees and I, in this case, am not only concerned about the additional Attorney's fees that will be chargeable to Howes Leather Company because of the additional work that I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.440" offset="9909164">But I'd better worry about the additional work that Mr. Heisler does for the plaintiffs in this case, because if he wins, then, under Section 4 of the Clayton Act, he is going to recover a reasonable attorney's fee from the defendant and, of course they're reasonable most of the fee and the amount will depend on how much work he does.</text>

            <text syncTime="2547.806" offset="10294627">References are expensive and time consuming.</text>

            <text syncTime="2639.129" offset="10659924">The proofs were closed on December 4, 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.797" offset="10682598">Now, someone asked about continuous hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.425" offset="10693047">Well, there were exactly 22 days in that period of nine months on which testimony was taken in the Krinsley case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.871" offset="10746859">The master filed his report four months later, April 21,1953 but the decree of the trial court wasn't entered until a year after that, March 17, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.079" offset="10815718">So that when this Court of Appeals and our Circuit said that this delay is serious and not inconsequential, they knew what they were talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.408" offset="10853021">Now, there's one other item which I wanted to touch on before I go to the other points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.320" offset="10888652">Mr. Sprowl, has made much of this memorandum in which the defendants describe count one of the amended complaint as fantastically complicated et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.585" offset="10949674">I was one of the signatories to that brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.142" offset="10967960">That brief was filed in support of a motion to strike count one of the amended complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.254" offset="11012368">This was a long time ago in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.464" offset="11033266">Judge La Buy struck count one of the amended complaint, and mind you, that brief was only filed in the Rohlfing case, not in the Shaffer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.689" offset="11102124">And, of course, here Judge La Buy referred two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.163" offset="11124067">When that brief was filed, there were 25 defendants in the Rohlfing case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.731" offset="11158340">There are now five, there were six at the time the reference was ordered in February, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.279" offset="11196479">Since then, one other defendant has dropped by the wayside and they are now five.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.822" offset="11218631">And I had great -- I would subscribe to that statement today if Rohlfing had 25 defendants and were in its original posture, but that wasn't the situation when this case was referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.831" offset="11298670">And I don't really know what Mr. Sprowl's point is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.478" offset="11313298">He illustrates how complicated this case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.918" offset="11331062">Certainly, he doesn't mean to say that Mr. Cowen, who is just a practicing lawyer like I, he doesn't mean to say that he's better qualified to decide this case with this Judge La Buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.115" offset="11387800">That -- that would be ridiculous as he doesn't have the training and he doesn't have the experience that Judge La Buy has.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.269" offset="11424475">And so the more complicated the case, I think perhaps, that's an argument for keeping it before the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.224" offset="11452270">And that's the basis, of course, for the difference in Rule 53 (b) with respect to the reference of jury cases where the issues are complicated and non-jury cases where complexity isn't mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.794" offset="11522591">But the language there is that a non-jury action and Rohlfing and Shaffer are both non-jury actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.530" offset="11557491">It shall be referred only upon a showing of some exceptional condition, which requires the reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.185" offset="11604093">And there's good reason for that difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.684" offset="11614124">Juries certainly complicated issues frequently are -- will escape them or will perhaps be dealt -- better dealt with if the case is referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.481" offset="11669295">Now, as I have said, these cases, Rohlfing and Shaffer, which are private antitrust actions, they look bad when you look at the complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.424" offset="11733034">But all these private travel damage actions today look bad when you look at the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.001" offset="11759365">The complaint isn't any -- isn't a reliable estimate of the complexity of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.695" offset="11790190">The judicial conference said that in the cases with which this report is concerned, and they weren't concerned with Rohlfing and Shaffer, they were concerned with cases like du Pont, Hartford-Empire, Ferguson versus Ford Motor, Alcoa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.276" offset="11852466">Now, you just can't talk about Rohlfing and Shaffer in the same breadth with those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.564" offset="11873677">In cases with which this report is concerned, complaints and charges are usually couched in broad terms and are met with general denials or demands for strict proof or for lack of information under the views of the function of pleadings which has prevailed in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.301" offset="11944626">The complaint and answer cannot, in most cases, of the type now under discussion, be relied upon as the means of framing the issues with sufficient (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.621" offset="11977853">And Mr. Brackmann Calister in his well-known article on the big case in 64 Harvard Larry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.556" offset="12001573">You said very often the complaint is of Gragner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.619" offset="12013798">The issue is imposed by it being far more comprehensive and elusive than any other put before a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.099" offset="12035741">Of course, that's precisely the case here.</text>

            <text syncTime="5018.882" offset="20178944">And Judge Magruder in the Josephson case, in dealing with an application for mandamus to revoke an order transferring a --a case from Judge Wyzanski's calendar to the federal court in the southwest, said that the cases that this Court decided before 1948, before the passage of the All Writs Act, were not authority for issuance of mandamus by a Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5064.839" offset="20362742">I respectfully suggest that Judge Magruder is wrong because you can't read cases like Peru or Roche and without seeing that this Court has said on more than one occasion, that its power to issue mandamus under what was originally Section 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 was confined constitutionally to those instances in which the writ was in aid of its appellate jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5104.892" offset="20522924">But getting the original jurisdiction to promote as the original jurisdiction would have no application here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5112.399" offset="20553017">It has defined the power of the Court of Appeals under what was Section 14 of that Judiciary Act as precisely the same -- precisely the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="5126.383" offset="20608920">And there are those cases where this Court said, we won't issue the writ of mandamus to the District Court on original application because there are no unusual circumstances which should make us take jurisdiction, take the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5146.297" offset="20688541">But go to the Court of Appeals, that's where you belong.</text>
            <text syncTime="5149.152" offset="20699930">That's really what I think they said in James.</text>
            <text syncTime="5152.450" offset="20713200">And in McCullough versus Cosgrave, that persistent disregard of the rules or this policy which Justice Frankfurter speaks, that could very well be the reason for this Court's entertaining the original application.</text>
            <text syncTime="5169.635" offset="20781955">James was merely cited to the Court in that case in the petition for mandamus as authority for the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5179.720" offset="20822288">That was the only mention made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5180.973" offset="20827303">I don't mean that this Court makes its own investigation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5185.271" offset="20844440">But I think that fact is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5195.035" offset="20883519">As I have said, the All Writs Act changed nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5203.877" offset="20918836">Petitioner argues that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="5205.823" offset="20926673">Well, petitioner must argue that, as Judge Magruder must argue that, in the Josephson case because that is vital if he is to get rid of the authority as McCullough.</text>
            <text syncTime="5222.985" offset="20995323">But the fact is that the powers were the same, and as a matter of fact when 1651 (a) was enacted, the revisers notes tell us that these former statutes, one of which dealt with the Supreme Court's power to mandamus, and one of which dealt with the Supreme Court and all other courts' power to issue extraordinary writs, they were eliminated as unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5253.093" offset="21115695">Now if they were unnecessary and certainly the old Section 13, which became Section 342 couldn't have given this Court some power that it doesn't have under the present statute, which applies to all courts alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="5269.476" offset="21181315">I want to call this Court's attention to the fact that there is no remedy by appeal in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.131" offset="21231888">In par, granted that it was a -- a rough remedy, perhaps, because he could have a very unpleasant experience in the mean time, but this Court was very careful to point out that he did have a remedy on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5298.728" offset="21298239">In Bankers Life, it was conceded that there was a remedy on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5308.662" offset="21338049">In Roche, there was a remedy on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5313.754" offset="21358425">In Roberts, the case of the indigent prisoner, he had -- he could start over again.</text>

            <text syncTime="5897.582" offset="23693667">Page 201 is where they show what they're attacking in the entire complaint and then -- the part I read to the Court before is from 207 where they're talking about the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5909.622" offset="23741837">Now, he sees they're all talking about count one, but from what I read before, they say there may be ten in each count from count two to count 105.</text>
            <text syncTime="5918.588" offset="23777677">They're not talking about count one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5920.809" offset="23786559">And this case, that I challenge, I don't represent this plaintiffs and I haven't had any water to carry for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5927.697" offset="23814144">I'm a little disadvantaged and not be in the case to know exactly what the evidence will be, but this is very clear from reading the judge's opinions which I read, that the defendants are trying to get somewhere by showing that some of them didn't sell to the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5946.133" offset="23887914">And the thing complained of, obviously is, that there is a conspiracy altogether that certain middlemen give the break to certain favored customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5956.205" offset="23928142">And it isn't the manufacturing defendants that do sell to the plaintiffs it's that some middleman who were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5963.368" offset="23956877">That doesn't make the case any less complicated or make it any less, 87 lawsuits, it just can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="5970.322" offset="23984671">Judge La Buy's opinion sets up the issues and that appears at 15 Federal Rules decisions, page 44, where he sets up the issues in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5986.211" offset="24048201">Now, Mr. Levy, has been out of the record more than any.</text>
            <text syncTime="5989.642" offset="24061889">I don't mind the Court having any information that is accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5995.400" offset="24084982">The Krinsley case was not an antitrust case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5997.687" offset="24094072">If you read the opinion, that it -- it arose out of an antitrust background.</text>
            <text syncTime="6001.237" offset="24108283">It was not an antitrust case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6002.765" offset="24114448">The Court expressly saw how.</text>
            <text syncTime="6005.221" offset="24124270">That's the one where the Court said there too many references.</text>
            <text syncTime="6009.121" offset="24139839">That was Judge Campbell's case not Judge La Buy's.</text>
            <text syncTime="6014.118" offset="24159796">There's nothing in the reporter of -- in this record about a court reporter before the master or anything about what the fees would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="6023.143" offset="24195950">Assuming that Mr. Levy is correct and I don't doubt that, that the master asked for a deposit, that is provided by the rule, Rule 53.</text>
            <text syncTime="6034.404" offset="24240985">It was provided by the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="6036.294" offset="24248508">It would amount to about $400 for reach of these defendants and around $80 for each plaintiff which is certainly nothing exorbitant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6047.862" offset="24294797">Now, he read at length from Adventures in Good Eating case about master fees being large and expensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="6055.232" offset="24324263">The fees there where it had said to be reasonable, there were about $450, as I remembered.</text>
            <text syncTime="6060.399" offset="24344952">It was an eight-hour hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6062.469" offset="24353207">The thing that the Court didn't like was that the Court would refer an eight-hour case to a master.</text>
            <text syncTime="6069.359" offset="24380792">Now, he said there are five defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="6073.879" offset="24398869">The record shows six and at the time of these references, there were 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="6077.651" offset="24414020">That is very clear and I refer to the record on page 19 -- no, at page 17 where the Court on the day before he ordered the references or when the question the masters first came up said, in the Rohlfing case there are 12 defendants left.</text>
            <text syncTime="6099.262" offset="24500433">That's page 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="6100.379" offset="24504926">That's when he entered the order, there were now six.</text>
            <text syncTime="6105.874" offset="24526869">Now, the -- the case is complicated, whether Mr. Levy wants to admit it now or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="6113.618" offset="24557798">The kind of evidence that will be entered will be these accounts of these purchases of these shoemakers, as he calls them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6124.479" offset="24601266">He said that he didn't know why there was no pretrial contrast.</text>
            <text syncTime="6129.309" offset="24620596">Judge La Buy was a state court judge in Illinois before he was a federal judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="6133.362" offset="24636792">And he's been a federal judge a great many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="6136.138" offset="24647973">He originated pretrial conferences in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6140.010" offset="24663437">He uses them extensively.</text>
            <text syncTime="6142.090" offset="24671692">But in this case, there had been then, as he said, more motions that in any case he ever heard of and the parties were not too cooperative and it was very obvious that there probably was nothing to be gained by a pretrial conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="6157.644" offset="24733968">There, the motion to revoke the reference was made, but it was limited to the fact that a new defendant had been added by the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="6165.137" offset="24763956">There have been parties added as well as dropped, who demanded a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6169.051" offset="24779525">They thought it was going to be a jury case and that was the sole basis for that motion to revoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="6178.916" offset="24819022">Now, he said that the case came on for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6181.615" offset="24829785">That is inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6185.384" offset="24844936">Before I cover that, I'd like to answer a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6187.514" offset="24853400">How do we assign this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="6189.047" offset="24859564">They have a good system in our district.</text>
            <text syncTime="6192.628" offset="24873880">The Court -- the court clerk prints up some opaque cards with the names of the judges one on each card.</text>
            <text syncTime="6199.971" offset="24903241">They make up a pack, we'll say of a hundred and we have eight judges, one-eighth of all the cards will have judge La Buy's name on and one-eighth will have each of the other judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="6209.144" offset="24939917">The clerk or someone under his supervision shuffles those cards and they are sealed up like a little pan so that you cannot see the name of any judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="6221.922" offset="24991013">In other words, we don't -- every fifth case doesn't go to Judge La Buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6227.992" offset="25015359">He may not get any for 18, but he will get one-eighth of each hundred cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6235.134" offset="25043884">And the clerk nor anybody else can tell who's going to get the next case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6238.689" offset="25058095">It's a -- a good system.</text>

            <text syncTime="6243.118" offset="25075858">He hears all motions in it, and Mr. Levy correctly said that he hears both criminal and civil cases and without any distinction, he accepted the criminal cases do have priority under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6256.043" offset="25127581">Now, this case, we also have a system on the trials that you put it on the trial call and that works its way up in a publish bulletin.</text>
            <text syncTime="6263.765" offset="25158405">This case has not been reached for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6266.987" offset="25171362">Still below the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="6268.250" offset="25176377">There's a line in there and they're a lot of cases above the line and they're supposed to be ready for trial and below the line they're coming on.</text>
            <text syncTime="6274.187" offset="25200097">This one was below the line, but this case have come up to number one below the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="6278.308" offset="25216606">It might not be reached for a month or two or so but it was coming on.</text>
            <text syncTime="6284.199" offset="25240116">And that was the situation as the record makes perfectly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="6288.697" offset="25258193">Read that at page 17, where there -- where the motion is made and all of that transcript is in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6295.565" offset="25285674">So, the parties wanted an early trial and Judge La Buy explained to them that he had cases, said it would him to clear up through this summer at best.</text>
            <text syncTime="6306.946" offset="25331127">And that the way they should have a trial in this case this opinion would by a master.</text>
            <text syncTime="6311.957" offset="25351189">Now then, he said that the reason that the plaintiffs were objecting to the trial date, now it hasn't been raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="6323.513" offset="25397373">They did ask to have it reset for June.</text>
            <text syncTime="6326.278" offset="25408449">But it isn't discovery, they want to take some depositions for trial and they proceeded to do it as the record show.</text>
            <text syncTime="6331.387" offset="25428929">They took 16 depositions after that date and before this -- this mandamus petitions were filed.</text>
