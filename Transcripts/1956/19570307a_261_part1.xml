            <text syncTime="98.265" offset="497434">The essential facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.959" offset="508197">Petitioner was subpoenaed to appear and did appear before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in April 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.621" offset="546858">Now, before he appeared, two witnesses had appeared before that Committee, one several years before and one recently before and had identified him as a Communist during the middle 1940's.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.777" offset="619478">Now, at the opening of his hearing which was in Washington D.C. on April 1954, the Chairman simply -- of the Committee simply announced, “We're here in continuation of what happened to Chicago.”</text>
            <text syncTime="141.947" offset="672141">Now, that was a hearing some six weeks before.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.980" offset="684366">Now that, at the outset of the hearing in Chicago, the Chairman of the Committee had made a lengthy pro-formal -- formal opening statement listing past and pending bills and giving the general aims and purposes of the Committee in this hearing and there will be more of that opening statement later.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.362" offset="777885">Now, at the hearing, petitioner testified freely and fully about himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.586" offset="806724">He affirmed his cooperation with the Communist Party during the years, 1942 to 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.569" offset="846639">1942 to 1947, he said “I cooperated with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.116" offset="864820">I was so close to him that some of them might honestly have believed I was part of them, but I didn't join.”</text>
            <text syncTime="196.338" offset="889793">He testified that in 1947, the middle of 1947 at a convention of his union which was then the Farm Equipment Workers, he got in such a bitter battle with the Communist over the question of compliance with the non-Communist oath provisions of Taft-Hartley this cooperation was over and from then on, he's been an anti-Communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.517" offset="990417">But after telling them all about himself, then it has come to all witnesses before the House of Un-American Activities Committee, he was asked the name certain other persons who in -- in the mid-1940's had been members of the Communist Party and it was here and here only that petitioner bought.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.226" offset="1089264">Now, on page 85 of the record is his statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.760" offset="1111416">“When he refused to say whether certain persons had been members of the Communist Party in the middle 1940's, I would like to get one thing perfectly clear Mr. Chairman, I am not going to plead the Firth Amendment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="267.173" offset="1173065">I would just like to -- to interpolate here for the Courts, for the clarity of the position and the problem of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.129" offset="1224892">At the time he made his decision on what to do before this Committee, he had only three alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.575" offset="1258747">This Court's decision in the Rogers case, made it impossible for him to do what might very well have been his first choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.617" offset="1294900">Namely, to have told all about himself and pleaded the Fifth Amendment when it came to informing on others.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.524" offset="1322486">That is not as he was informed a legal possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.151" offset="1340980">The Fifth Amendment is not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.663" offset="1351011">The self-incrimination provisions are not available, if you have already incriminated yourself by the -- under the (Inaudible) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.423" offset="1386120">So, his choices, with that choice ruled out were these three, he could have known all the information from the Committee by pleading the Fifth Amendment as to his own personal activities and also as to the others and it is this Court's decisions in the (Inaudible) cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.003" offset="1448396">It was clear he had this right or he could have told everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.493" offset="1466368">Namely, he could have told all about himself and he could have named the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.611" offset="1486848">As to this, he would then been an informer, the worst crime he can commit among his own associates.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.195" offset="1513179">And the third, the third is to tell about yourself, which he was not ashamed of it, which he was willing and did do and then say, this is what he did choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.086" offset="1552781">This was the third alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.497" offset="1558424">“You don't have power to force me to name the other persons, because it's beyond your jurisdiction and because you are engaged in exposure.”</text>
            <text syncTime="372.085" offset="1592696">And this is what he said then as he chose the alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.383" offset="1609937">“I would like to get one thing perfectly clear Mr. Chairman.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.473" offset="1622267">I am not going to plead the Fifth Amendment, but I refuse to answer certain questions that I believe are outside the proper scope of your Committee's activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.683" offset="1659152">I will answer any questions which this Committee puts to be about myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.851" offset="1675766">I will also answer questions about those persons whom I knew to be members to the Communist Party and whom I believed still are.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.566" offset="1702619">I will not, however, answer any questions with respect to others with whom I associated in the past,” then I skip.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.694" offset="1731145">“I do not believe that such questions are relevant to the work of this Committee nor do I believe that this Committee has the right to undertake the public exposure of persons because of their past activities.”</text>

            <text syncTime="433.491" offset="1838352">Now, when petitioner finished his statement, the Committee did not contradict his assertion that they were engaged in public exposure.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.254" offset="1877431">The Chairman simply paraphrased the Committee's resolution and said, “Answer”.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.825" offset="1903658">“Petitioner stuck to his prepared statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.532" offset="1914525">They asked him a numbers of 30 odd people.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.865" offset="1931870">He is stuck to his ground, but he would not name those in the past who he no longer felt were members of the Party.”</text>
            <text syncTime="465.746" offset="1967397">Here, the Committee had before him an expert in Communist activities in the labor movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.054" offset="1992579">But when he refused to inform on these others not one more question, not one question about Communist techniques in the labor movement, he was discharged.</text>

            <text syncTime="637.227" offset="2653268">He was asked the question with about 25 names in it and he pulled one name out of it and said, “That fellow is still is and I won't answer as to the rest.”</text>
            <text syncTime="645.872" offset="2687854">Now, the trial court held that all of the petitioner's evidence and proof of exposure was irrelevant, apparently and I say apparently because the district judge did not give his reasons for any of his rulings nor for the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.885" offset="2739890">Apparently, accepting a prosecuting attorney's position which I could phrase as follows, “Fifth Amendment or nothing, it is the position of the Government in the trial courts,” although I am not quite as clear that it is their position here, although it is quite close to it that the only defense to a contempt of Congress indictment in this area of Communism is the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.159" offset="2849081">That was squarely stated by the prosecuting attorney in the lower court here and it was apparently and I say apparently because the judge did not say anything except, “Your evidence is excluded,” the disposition of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.406" offset="2913970">Now, the petitioner was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.158" offset="2921075">He appealed as I said before of the three-judge panel, the conviction was reversed, then there was a reversal of the reversal and the conviction was affirmed 62.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.931" offset="2976141">Those are believed are the essential facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.081" offset="2996726">The first point we lay before, Your Honors, I do not believe we need to elaborate on to any great extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.898" offset="3027968">It's made in our initial and our reply brief and it is that the power to investigate does not encompass exposure unrelated to a legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.826" offset="3079690">And when I say I don't believe we need to pause long on this point, I say it because it is an obvious corollary of the doctrine of separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.593" offset="3126815">And also, because I do not understand the Government to -- seriously to contest the proposition, that exposure -- for exposure sake is beyond detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.333" offset="3169761">Now, the proposition, it seems to me is simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.313" offset="3185643">The legislative function is to determine general standards of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.291" offset="3209571">The executive function is to prosecute for infractions of the general standard of conduct and the judicial function is to determine guilt when a congressional committee determined a standard of conduct to debar, namely past membership in the Communist Party and then, through exposure by calling him before them, prosecutes him, forces him to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.925" offset="3328063">And then finally, through the determination of guilt by their accusation of him and their reports about him, keeps injurious publicity upon him, they are combining all three functions in one.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.747" offset="3391384">I would suggest to Your Honors, we use the different example in our brief but supposed we went back to the 1910s, during the period when Mr. Mann was considering and bringing before the Congress, the Mann Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.088" offset="3448748">Supposed at that time, he had felt, “I cannot get a bill through Congress.”</text>
            <text syncTime="840.492" offset="3466407">Suppose he had felt that President Wilson, I believed it was, would not have sign such a bill and indeed he didn't have the votes to pass it over a veto, but he says to himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.605" offset="3514786">“I can accomplish the same thing by simply calling before the -- our Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.745" offset="3543416">I'll get a right to investigate and I'll call before the Committee everybody I can find who I have any suspicion may pass in the past have violated the Mann Act, what is now the Mann Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="873.714" offset="3599214">In other words, supposed Mr. Mann had sought to do by injurious publicity exactly what they did by legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.129" offset="3632964">I think this Court would have had no hesitancy in striking that down as an effort to accomplish without legislation to substitute purposes of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.887" offset="3671939">Now, the Government does make two tangential points about this so I'd like to refer to, although as I -- I honestly believe they are not in --in wholehearted disagreement on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.523" offset="3726482">First, the Government refers to the quote, “informing function” of Congress as one that has been written up in the books, although admittedly, not in the books of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.060" offset="3784683">Now, that of course phrase, “informing function” goes back to President Wilson at the time he wrote his great text on the subject of Congress, but President Wilson's reference to the informing function was to something different.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.195" offset="3845183">It was to the internal debates and give and take within Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.204" offset="3865245">Indeed, President Wilson's illustration of the informing function was the question and answer period in the House of Commons about as far away from the idea of compulsory testimony being used for the informing function as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.529" offset="3938492">Now, it is true when the Government cites a number of articles at page 55 of its brief that President Wilson's informing function has carried over in some articles, never ratified by this Court to suggest an informing function in another category.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.384" offset="4013934">And here, it is in the supervision of public administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.362" offset="4033891">Now, I do not have to carry the burden before this Court to argue that there is or isn't such an informing function when it comes to the supervision of the executive branch in the administration of law in America, because we do not have that case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.335" offset="4113721">Here, we do not have the informing function of a supervision of public administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.017" offset="4136500">Here, we have the informing function if you seek to call it that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.318" offset="4153637">Here, we have the exposure, injurious publicity applied to a private citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.916" offset="4180072">Now, the Government also in -- in another tangential point refers to statutes such as the Lobbying Act and the Public Utilities Holding Company Act, where Congress, by statute has required publicity as a method of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.204" offset="4277248">And I'm prepared to rest our case on the distinction between Congress passing a statute requiring the publicizing of information and a Committee of Congress, maybe a single congressman seeking to accomplish that same result through the subpoena power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.742" offset="4371393">Now, if Your Honors please, when you have a statute, it's general in application, it's prospective in effect and it's definite in operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.898" offset="4412040">When you have congressional committee seek to operate both as legislature judge and jury, then the exposure becomes discriminatory in application, retroactive in effect as it is here and arbitrary in procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.703" offset="4483197">I do not think it is too much to say, but what we have in our case here and what the House Committee's practices have been is that lawmaker investigator, prosecutor, judge and jury, all five reside in the one subcommittee and may reside as it has in the past in one individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="1256.035" offset="5128526">So, we pass to point two of our argument, which Government does seriously contest and that is that the purpose of the Committee here in interrogating petitioner was to expose him and his former associates to scorn and ridicule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.123" offset="5200938">Now, if Your Honors please, I'm not bringing to this Court a closed case because I believe that there were closed case about whether it was exposure and legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1299.094" offset="5300726">If Your Honors will read the questioning of petitioner from pages 70 to 90 of this record, you will not find one question of any possible relation to any possible legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.311" offset="5377630">Now, I quite agree with Justice Frankfurter's implication of this question that you may have to ask a lot of questions that are unrelated to a specific bill in order to find out what your legislation ought to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.247" offset="5437398">But when -- but here, by both what they asked petitioner and by what they didn't ask him, it's perfectly clear that all they wanted from him were names, names, names of human beings to determine whether in fact they have been Communist in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.227" offset="5533320">Once, he said, “I will not give you those names.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.630" offset="5546904">I will not tell you where these people were,” they get rid of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.233" offset="5561323">They told him they didn't want to ask him anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.450" offset="5570205">Now, they didn't have before him a man without knowledge in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.840" offset="5591730">I submit that Mr. Watkins is an expert.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.685" offset="5615135">He had cooperated with him and he had broken with them and what had he broken with them over?</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.011" offset="5644392">Compliance with the very statute, namely the Taft-Hartley Act non-Communist previsions, which if there was to be further legislation would have to be amended or changed or -- or additional provisions provided, not a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.088" offset="5712729">And when he said to them as I read the statement, “You do not have the power to engage in this exposure,” their answer was a quotation, a paraphrase of the authorization prevision and as answer you are directed to answer the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.723" offset="5779289">In other words, the -- the questioning is clear and therefore, I may have again unduly complicated my case by seeking to provide so much additional evidence of the -- the purpose of exposure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.621" offset="5834877">In other words, we have in the record and in our brief pages after pages of proof that the House Un-American Activities Committee asserts this independent power of exposure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.288" offset="5893496">Now, it did seem to me that that was relevant evidence and so to as Judge Edgerton, that the fact that a Committee asserts a power can be considered in determining whether it was exercising that assertive power at a given time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1635.604" offset="6646763">Now, that is the position as I understand it of the Government here that the Committee's purpose was to find the exact number of communists in middle 1940s by getting the names of each one and holding them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1844.308" offset="7481637">Now, in a two-page lengthy opening statement, this was six weeks before petitioner testified in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.442" offset="7514133">This was the opening statement in Chicago six weeks before, but in the opening statement in Washington, they refer back to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.323" offset="7545689">This is a -- what you might call a gently causing statement about the past activities of the -- of the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.508" offset="7578394">And there is a reference in this statement on -- in this opening statement on Page 44 to a bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.140" offset="7612980">This is the second paragraph on page 44, to a bill which would deprive Communist infiltrated labor unions of the facilities of the MLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.252" offset="7685392">Now, if your Honors please, that bill was enacted or rather another bill was enacted but on that same subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.403" offset="7730009">Now, here is an opening statement telling all about your activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.270" offset="7749444">Immediately thereafter, they go into all other sponsor activities, communist at farms, communists in the Government and all other activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.409" offset="7782045">And then, they come to this fellow, Watkins, and they asked him questions that haven't any relation whatever to this bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.840" offset="7815795">And yet, they say because this bill was mentioned, therefore, a question that has no relationship whatever to the Bill is in some way to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.073" offset="7864696">Now, it maybe, it may very well be that if the Bill haven't been mentioned, the questioning still could have been about something that might produce legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.689" offset="7911194">But the fact that the bill is mentioned, if the questioning is wholly unrelated in any way to the possibilities of that bill, the bill itself is not determinative or relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.887" offset="7959991">Indeed, I think the best way I could put it is that the dependency of legislation is not a hunting license to engage in exposure where the questions have no relation to that legislation and there it seems to me again the -- the case rest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2064.371" offset="8361859">Indeed, I'd like to call Your Honor's attention that this new suggestion of the Government that they were trying to get a retroactive census of the names of every Communist in the mid-1940s in the labor movement was as late as their brief and opposition only a hypothetical possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.004" offset="8444406">On page 5 of our reply brief, I quote from the Government's brief in opposition where the Government says, “If the Committee had the additional and more general way of ascertaining the number of communists at a particular period on a recent history, that too would be a valid subject of inquiry.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.316" offset="8521624">In other words, what the Government now says is the subject of inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.361" offset="8537819">They had this latest brief in our position simply suggest it was a hypothetical possibility as to the subject of inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.506" offset="8570420">Well, if Your Honors please, it seems to be that -- that we have shown a purpose of exposure and that in light with Your Honor, Mr. Justice Frankfurter has suggested himself the -- on the constitutional aspect of this, that would end the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.418" offset="8646071">I personally was prepared to rest the case on those two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.679" offset="8667073">However, I remember the discomfiture of counsel in Peters v.

            <text syncTime="2162.540" offset="8754531">And therefore, we have -- we do contend, if Your Honors please, that the -- these questions are not within the authorizing resolution, that of course being a narrower ground of decision than a serious constitutional issue of separation of powers that we have raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.874" offset="8815867">Now, there are two possible grounds of interpretation of the congressional -- authorizing resolution, which would take the questioning of petitioner outside of that resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.522" offset="8870515">First, that there was no intent by Congress to give the Committee a power of exposure, and if Your Honors will examine the resolution, it's in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.347" offset="8925790">It's in the briefs of many places.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.016" offset="8932477">It's in our brief at page 4 of our -- of the initial white petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.400" offset="8957973">You will notice that the purpose that deals with the extent character and objects of Un-American Activities and subversive propaganda.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.324" offset="8989738">And three, all other questions in relation thereto that would aid Congress in any necessary remedial legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.067" offset="9020667">It does seem to us three that those words in any necessary remedial legislation are -- cover both one and two as well as three and therefore, there was no power of exposure given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.817" offset="9079704">And therefore, if our proof is correct on the exposure point, Your Honors would -- could by interpretation of the resolution accomplish the same result as I have argued under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.466" offset="9138218">Secondly, however, and I think it's even clearer if Your Honors please, this -- to summarize this resolution in a sentence, it's a power to investigate Un-American and subversive propaganda activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.115" offset="9192866">Now, where in subversive and Un-American Propaganda Activity, you find an authority to ask a man to name certain persons as Communists in 1945?</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.017" offset="9252425">In other words, it seems to us that on that narrowest ground, we are outside of the resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.495" offset="9282414">Now, I would be less than candid if I did not say that that over simplifies the problem, because for the last 20 years, the House Committee has been doing what we are here complaining of to the public knowledge of everyone and to the knowledge of the members of the house who have reenacted the resolution, who have given them appropriations and who -- one could argue have ratified what they have been doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.278" offset="9409473">And it was because of the ratification point that I preferred to rely on the constitutional argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.525" offset="9438521">But again, referring to our duty to find the narrowest ground, I would say to Your Honors that there is a serious question whether Congress could ratify so broad a change in the meaning of the resolution as it's necessary to cover the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.353" offset="9509784">In other words, there are decisions of this Court that what you can ratify is only a reasonable interpretation of a resolution and that this interpretation to broaden the words, propaganda and propaganda activities to cover identification of all Communists in mid-1940s, let us say is beyond a reasonable broadening of those words and I --</text>

            <text syncTime="2742.344" offset="11073787">What this investigation says -- what this - or resolution says is that the Committee has the authority to investigate Un-American and subversive propaganda activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.192" offset="11125196">Was petitioner to know that when he was asked about people in 1945, whether they were members of the Party that that was propaganda, that that was subversive, that that was Un-American, I would challenge anybody to suggest that different people sitting in that chair would not reach different conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2775.269" offset="11205444">They say that all resolutions of Congress are too vague to meet the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.258" offset="11225401">They rely on the fact that if you hold them up to the standard of a -- of a criminal statute, then they will not be able, Congress will not be able to do its job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.085" offset="11264690">I suggest they forget that in the House -- House of Representatives today, there are only three committees that exercise this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.943" offset="11304187">Whatever vagueness you may want to have in Congress for internal functioning of the body is one thing, but when they seek to use the subpoena power and to prosecute people for violation, certainly, they must live up to the standards of the (Inaudible) Grocery case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.558" offset="11374613">It is one thing if they call a witness before the bar of the House when he gets a last clear chance to answer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3079.613" offset="12422855">What were they trying to do for the Communist Party?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.604" offset="12438841">Mr. Rumsey, “Well what they were striving to do was to disrupt mainly to set their program of propaganda to get the shop workers acclimated to the daily worker and that was the function of the organizer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.352" offset="12509790">Then, there's other testimony about how things were being done and on page 139 and about the same general point on the page, Mr. (Inaudible), “Could you tell us specifically what your duties were as organizer for the Communist Party?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.347" offset="12581784">That was to Mr. Rumsey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.299" offset="12589620">Mr. Rumsey answered, “Well, to recruit and to recruit new members, hold study groups, clubs as they called it, study clubs in the evenings and then as I say, keep our people in the shop what communist we had to lead the union meetings and dominate them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.804" offset="12699648">Then, Spencer said he recruited -- was recruited in the Communist Party by Rumsey with the endorsement of this petitioner as well as if prior approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.563" offset="12754610">Petitioner was then the Vice President of the Farm Equipment CIO and he said he attended Communist Party meeting at which the petitioner and two others, Kate Hall and Jerry Field were present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.467" offset="12826290">Then, the petitioner described his official position with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.197" offset="12841232">He was one of the important officers during this period at which time the evidence is clear from these other witnesses that this union was infiltrated by the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.092" offset="12892745">Petitioner admitted knowing Rumsey and Spencer and was familiar with their testimony concerning him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.036" offset="12924510">He admitted that he cooperated with the Communist Party and having “participated in Communist activities during 1942 to 1947,” to such a degree that some persons may honest believe -- honestly believe we too have been a Party member.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.932" offset="13004131">He admitted making contributions to the communist causes, signed petitions for their various causes, attended coxes at a convention of the union at which Communist Party officials were present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.652" offset="13067034">He participated in the union meetings with the Communist (Inaudible), attended public meetings of the Communist Party at which William Z. Foster then president spoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.028" offset="13128474">He also testified that he was aware that -- that there was a general program policy of the Communist Party to attempt to control the various unions and testified it was quote “Probably correct to say that the discussions he had with them, individuals known by him to be communist had been in connection with their desire to control the union's policy and activities.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.159" offset="13256997">Already denied that he had been a card carrying member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.046" offset="13288552">He contradicted both Spencer and Rumsey and said he had nothing to do with recruiting men.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.403" offset="13330035">He said that Spencer was wrong when he termed any meetings which the petitioner attended as closed Communist Party meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.299" offset="13373607">He contradicted Rumsey and denied having recruited Rumsey or receiving dues from him or paying dues to him under the alias of Sam Brown.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="3336.128" offset="13448944">Yes, because of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.664" offset="13459080">It shows that there was an inquiry to this man about the question of infiltrating unions for communist purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.092" offset="13500771">The -- the Congress within four months after this in the Communist Control Act of 1954 passed an amendment to the Internal Security Act of 1950 in which it provided with regard to unions which had been infiltrated and took away from their opportunity to have the benefits of the NLRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.975" offset="13608291">So that Congress was inquiring at this very moment about that from this very petitioner, obtained information from him that he knew that that was what was happening in that very union, that the Communist Party was actively engaged in this very activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.264" offset="13681434">They then proceed to legislate about it and they were inquiring about it at the time to determine about the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.858" offset="13711841">Now, when they asked him about these things, the evidence also shows that everyone of these people that they asked him about, they had asked Rumsey and Spencer about prior to that and Rumsey and Spencer has said that they were members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.905" offset="13791984">And they had also asked as I have shown, Rumsey and Spencer about propaganda activities, the efforts of the Communist Party to infiltrate this very union and what they knew about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.708" offset="13843184">Now, this witness comes there and he said -- he denies the testimony of Rumsey and Spencer with regard to himself and Rumsey and Spencer in this very proceeding at Chicago had been asked about some 25 to 30 different persons whether they were communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.799" offset="13935553">And Rumsey and Spencer said that everyone was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.248" offset="13953421">Here, this man says, “I wasn't a Communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.539" offset="13970557">I did a lot of things like people might think I was a communist, but I wasn't.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.341" offset="13993754">He apparently had knowledge in regard to this union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.342" offset="14009741">He was an officer of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.770" offset="14015488">He cooperated with the communist and then very active.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.079" offset="14032729">Now, if you could find any place that was more ideal to try to discover facts upon which Congress could act knowledge -- knowledgeably, I'd like to know what it could be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.797" offset="14087586">Here, in this very union, in this very thing that Congress was looking for had happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.406" offset="14110051">They had infiltrated, this man was part of it and these witnesses that testified to his participation and to the other activities and how they did it, by propaganda and the common methods of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.728" offset="14175357">Then, they come to him and they asked him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.483" offset="14186329">He says, “I'm not a Communist,” and he says, “These men might have thought so, but I'm not,” and he questioned their testimony about receiving dues or whether a man was a Communist or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.654" offset="14238992">It might be a question that is difficult and his explanation of the fact, “That I acted like a Communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.312" offset="14269607">I cooperated with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.823" offset="14275668">I did things from which people might infer or conclude I was a Communist,” might be answer to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.888" offset="14299909">But when you get down to the question of whether or not he paid dues and received dues, that's a question of fact that would be hard to be wrong about.</text>
