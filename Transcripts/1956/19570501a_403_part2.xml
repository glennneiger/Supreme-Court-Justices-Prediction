            <text syncTime="23.955" offset="199241">The question was, we're the Filipinos aliens?</text>

            <label>Mr. John Caughlan</label>
            <text syncTime="35.738" offset="246366">That is the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.650" offset="250023">My answer to that was posed upon the entirety, the composite of all the statutes as they applied in 1951 when this conviction took place as I must treat the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.187" offset="312090">But if I were to look back to 1931, not to determine what the statute says but what light we can get on what they might have been thinking at that time, what they considered aliens then.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.779" offset="370500">Of course, the Filipinos at that time were not aliens but that leads me to the concluding matter which I cannot stress sufficiently.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.271" offset="408430">That between that time and the time that the offense was committed, many statutes have changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.624" offset="429850">That's why we were passed up the present state of the statutes, and most particularly, the statutes on page 7 of the Government's brief, the Filipino Independence Act which up to the 1946, made such clear provisions that the Immigration Act of 1917, which we've been talking about, relating to the immigration, exclusion, or expulsion -- may I finish the sentence?</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="110.770" offset="546461">Yes, of course.</text>

            <label>Mr. John Caughlan</label>
            <text syncTime="112.074" offset="551685">-- of aliens, the citizens -- the citizens of the Philippine Islands are to be considered as if they were aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.484" offset="589302">And then in 1946 -- that is further down on page 7, there was a complete sweep divorcing them entirely from nationality and giving them certain benefits to which Mr. Justice Frankfurter directed attention which I had here available.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.048" offset="659519">So that, between that time and now, there were these statutes which completely made aliens out of the Filipinos so that as of 1951, when this conviction took place, there's no question about their being aliens, no question about the intent of the Congress as evidenced by all these statutes taken together to include them within the scope and to deport.</text>
