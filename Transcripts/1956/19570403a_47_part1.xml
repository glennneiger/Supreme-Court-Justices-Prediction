            <label>Mr. Samuel C. McMorris</label>
            <text syncTime="27.761" offset="214392">This is an -- is appeal, substantially an attack upon the validity of what is known as the criminal registration ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.806" offset="250546">Specifically, it is an appeal from the conviction of appellant herein and from her -- from the sustaining of that conviction by the Appellate Department of the Superior Court of the County of Los Angeles for failure to register with the Police Department for a crime which she had been convicted four years before the date of her arrest which led to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.673" offset="366111">Our arguments, we based upon four different propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.110" offset="387845">First, that any criminal registration ordinance is unconstitutional and that it violates certain fundamental rights of American citizenship, which we will elaborate more at length.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.949" offset="447195">Second, that if it is possible to concede of the validity in the abstract of a criminal registration ordinance, that the specific ordinance here involved is unreasonable and violates certain fundamental rights of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.731" offset="514278">Third, that assuming that the ordinance is not on its phase or not per se invalid and unconstitutional, that it has been so applied that under the rule of Yick Wo against Hopkins, it in -- in essence and in procedural and in fact it has been made unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.752" offset="586376">And finally, that appellant herein was denied her specific case of the benefits of many constitutional provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.611" offset="629844">Now, on the first hand, that any criminal registration is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.435" offset="669132">The whole essence and content, and purpose of the criminal registration laws is to require that a person who had served his or her sentence or time, or paid the penalty of a crime against the State must thereafter register with the police or Sheriff Department where he or she lives, and must continue to inform that Police Department or Sheriff's Department for the rest of his or her natural life in most cases of any change of address.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.239" offset="784280">Now, this we submit is an invasion of the individual's right of privacy, the right of freedom of locomotion, the right to be left alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="1385.491" offset="5645354">Second, whereas in the few cases where it has been used, usually, the defendant is an indigent who cannot afford even to pay the nominal fine which is given and -- or second, the -- the fine is so small that -- that there's nothing to fight about in -- in a sense except for of course one's reputation and one's feeling of injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.960" offset="5719228">In this case, fortunately for the appellant, she was employed by her counsel as -- as his legal secretary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1412.692" offset="5754128">Second, the fact that she was given such a severe sentence for this type of -- of an offense, three years probation, where at the time of her trial, as the Court knew she had not been convict -- she had not voluntarily committed any crime for four years, not just with forgery, since she was working for an attorney as legal secretary going to school at night, when this is merely a technical violation of ordinance which was generally unknown, was not known to me until this case arose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1454.950" offset="5923192">But in spite of all those things, the Court saw fit to -- to impose a three-year probation, one of the conditions thereof was a payment of $250 fine which -- and in -- in of that condition that the defendant meant, no probation at all would refrain --</text>

            <text syncTime="2175.706" offset="8806170">I'd like to go, however, into my contention that this specific ordinance is unreasonable, but first, as to the general unreasonableness of any criminal registration ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.108" offset="8855803">Let me point out that this particular law was panic legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.330" offset="8876701">It was -- as stated very ably in the brief of respondent which is quoted from this -- from the registration ordinance of -- in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review and I think it appears on page 3 as I recall it of respondent's brief -- sorry, page 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.777" offset="8970428">The historical background and basis for legislation require the registration of ex-convicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.501" offset="9001357">It is pointed out here that this legislation had its foundation in -- in a law in the early 1930s with reference to criminal -- professional criminality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.732" offset="9050258">And this was one of the results, the registration ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.760" offset="9062379">Now, in the criminal registration ordinance note from which this background is taken, in a portion which is omitted, it -- it also points out that the gangster laws are also the result of this period, of -- of frustration and alarm, and ended up -- a few of the laws which were passed, punish a person just for being criminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.002" offset="9151404">And -- and the New Jersey law, which was set aside I believe by this Court of -- of the gangster statute from New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.379" offset="9180871">Well, Lanzetta against New Jersey, 306 U.S.451 was in that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.026" offset="9203440">A similar law in Michigan was held unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.343" offset="9216711">These were the gangster laws, which drew out of this period of concern and alarm about an alleged rise in criminality of this period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.217" offset="9248266">Actually, this note on the criminal registration ordinance questions the factual background of that because it's pointed out that actually, there was a decrease in criminality according to criminological figures, but that is not important to our consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.986" offset="9299362">The fact is we have two types of law they drew out of the concern in -- during 1930s.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.900" offset="9322977">One, were the gangster laws, which have been declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.988" offset="9335306">The other were criminal registration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.042" offset="9343561">May I also point out that only five states have adopted our State's, the criminal registration law, California being one, New Jersey, Illinois, Florida and Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.490" offset="9393298">Only 47 municipalities have adopted this type of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.510" offset="9409390">The only major city other than Los Angeles is Philadelphia that has adopted criminal registration ordinance, the other not having found it necessary are useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.898" offset="9442931">Washington does not have one, New York, Chicago, nor of a major city have this type of ordinance, except for Philadelphia and Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.449" offset="9469158">And this I think is maybe considered the standpoint of how necessary or even how reasonable it may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.836" offset="9490683">It's not a final determination I think it may be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.902" offset="9503013">It has not been found necessary generally in the United States to adopt this sort of invasion into an -- it ended the -- the privately entered verdict has completely served the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.412" offset="9541047">And for the rest of his or her natural life, you must report to the Police Department, exposing yourself inherently to rouse the arrest and that's -- and the sort of thing to which police departments are so capable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.710" offset="9590262">Recently, California has found it necessary to adopt the (Inaudible) case rule to stop police intrusion into individual privacy, as the federal court did some time ago in its law against a reasonable search and seizure.</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel C. McMorris</label>
            <text syncTime="3041.016" offset="12267395">In this -- this law review note which I keep mentioning has indicated only 10% of the criminal's generate where this law is applicable have registered, only 10%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.321" offset="12304697">And as -- as -- and finally, I quote from a Solicitor General of Canton, Ohio, one of the cities where it is -- we have one before the seven cities having ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.133" offset="12339911">We made two arrests over a period of two years relating to failure to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.652" offset="12357987">You see, what happens is this, there is no direct effort made to enforce the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.597" offset="12373765">It only comes into play when you're arrested for something else and it is therefore found you have not registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.529" offset="12393514">I -- I've never noticed a situation where the police would go down the record and say, “Here's an ex-convict who haven't registered.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.363" offset="12416815">Let's go out and arrest him or make him register.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.119" offset="12423816">It's only when you're arrested for some other cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.806" offset="12434578">And for that reason, the law is also unreasonable and that those who want to be law abiding will register.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.333" offset="12464671">Those who didn't want to -- want to be law abiding will not register because the law does not come into play until they're arrested to say with some subsequent offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.379" offset="12492884">Therefore, it served no valid purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.069" offset="12499675">It just interfered with the private lives of people who want to be a law abiding citizens, because if they can't make registry, except while you're on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.616" offset="12529873">Therefore, those who wish to violate the law will not register and -- and no one goes out to find to make him register.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.937" offset="12555160">It's only if you get arrested for robbery, or burglary, or bookmaking or something like that, then you'll say, “Uh-huh, you haven't registered.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.019" offset="12575431">So, that's another separate offense which does not increase your time because -- because you've been convicted in the other county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.415" offset="12592985">Anyhow, when a person like this, like our appellant here who would -- who have gone -- who had been rehabilitated, would go and register because they don't want to violate the law and do not intend, do not -- in a sense have nothing to hide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.236" offset="12640319">So -- and yet, whenever a crime is committed in the category to be or expected to commit, they'll be exposed to dragnet rage, dragnet arrest which has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.546" offset="12673546">That has been the result, the adherent result of this type of ordinance wherever it has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.216" offset="12692250">And in fact, if I may quote again the -- from -- from this note that “That is one of the purposes which would either was had in mind or which the police recognized as a valuable ordinance like this,” referring to the adoption of the Los Angeles, California ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.825" offset="12762676">It was reported that District Attorney Berne Fitz and Robert B.Stewart, Chief Deputy District Attorney who affirmed the legislation, and Chief of Police James Davis, one of its chief supporters, declare that the very fact that dangerous ex-convicts will not register is the strength of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3202.431" offset="12913142">No indication of why they did it because the girl certainly was not using narcotics and he searched her purse right there in the street corner.</text>
