            <label>Mr. Joseph E. Finley</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">1-- three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.103" offset="155773">With reference to the point Mr. Justice Douglas was pursuing with Mr. Manoli before the recess as to the applicability of Section 8 (b) in unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.717" offset="194226">I think it's quite clear that 8 (b) has no application whatsoever in any aspect of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.599" offset="217736">8 (b) refers to union unfair labor practices in the normal union activity capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.772" offset="250441">8 (a) refers to employers and it's when the union is acting as an employer, that is an entirely different matter of when it's committing a secondary boycott or applying restraint and coercion to the employees of other employers.</text>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="49.712" offset="302268">Well, under your argument the labor union might be under 8 (a) then?</text>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="56.688" offset="330167">Yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_e_finley" startTime="56.795" stopTime="179.245">
            <label>Mr. Joseph E. Finley</label>
            <text syncTime="56.795" offset="330585">-- and that is the only thing it's under.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.290" offset="336541">And then 8 (b) has no application whatsoever to any situations of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.669" offset="366007">Now, the other point which I wanted to touch on very briefly is back again to Section 2 (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="71.216" offset="388263">Mr. Justice Frankfurter referred to it and the others have too, and I certainly agree that 2 (2) puts them in.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.548" offset="413550">It's not a mandate, 2 (2) has put them in the Act and then we go to consider in this case the policy reasons as to how you would treat them.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.437" offset="453151">Now, I say the Board, when it considers these policy reasons, has got to take in all the aspects of it, and I say and fundamentally the Board cannot put on blinkers and disregard the legislative history of -- of 2 (2) as it comes to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.395" offset="512920">And that is one of the essential factors that must be taken into consideration when you deal with the question, the so-called policy question of whether or not you're going to take jurisdiction over activities of unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.981" offset="563284">Now, the question was also raised about the exclusion of some classes of employers such as hotels and taxicabs.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.712" offset="590242">Again, the same standards I think should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.713" offset="598183">What are the variety of reasons which support a sound rational decision?</text>
            <text syncTime="129.187" offset="620126">In those cases, I think could be distinguished from this.In hotels and taxicabs, the Board apparently felt that there was a -- these were essentially local in character, a rational kind of finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.805" offset="662549">But no such thing applies to labor organizations and besides in hotels and taxicabs, you don't have the kind of legislative history you have here if anything you may deem something in the other direction with regard to declination of jurisdiction over hotels and taxis.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.519" offset="729422">But here, we have to view this history made by the 73rd and 74th Congresses which indicated that Congress wanted them in and did not want the Board to wipe them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.177" offset="772054">I think it's those kind of standards we have to take into consideration and there is where the Board has come into arbitrary and capricious action in disregarding these basic fundamental elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.426" offset="817089">Thank you.</text>
