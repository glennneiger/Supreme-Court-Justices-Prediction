            <label>Mr. Samuel W. Plauche, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="29.983" offset="223274">What the -- this is a review of an interlocutory order of injunction issued by the District Court below and affirmed by the Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.891" offset="270921">The fundamental question presented is whether or not the District Court's order was authorized improper, despite the federal anti-injunction statute, and in the face of the rule of committee which prevents the District Court or prevented it as we say from interfering with previously acquired and subsisting in rem jurisdiction of petitioner's suit which was pending in a state court of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.312" offset="392652">The brief history of the litigation is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.879" offset="410937">In August of 1953, petitioner brought its petitory action in a state court of Louisiana in -- in for Plaquemines Parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.463" offset="453256">The Court there was a court of general or plenary jurisdiction of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.102" offset="475826">It was a petitory action brought by petitioner claiming recognition of its right entitled to the mineral rights which underlay some 8700 acres of marsh land in Plaquemines Parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.268" offset="532459">It was brought, as it was authorized to do and as it was expressly required by Louisiana practice to do against those parties in possession of the mineral rights, the California Company and a man named Lobrano, who, it was alleged by petitioner were wrongfully withholding the possession of petitioner's rights from petitioner and the possession was alleged to on behalf of petitioner to have been unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.958" offset="655235">It is true that the claim by petitioner in the state court rested upon its claim of -- its right to recognition of its title to the minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.913" offset="699016">Promptly upon the suit having been brought in accordance -- strict accordance of the Court of Louisiana procedure, the defendants, California Company and Lobrano, undertook to remove the case to the federal court in and for the Eastern District of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.272" offset="756485">Petitioner filed a motion to remand which was granted by Judge Wright who later issued the injunction which is under review here.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.523" offset="789504">Judge Wright -- it was removed on the ostensible ground that there was a federal question presented by petitioner's state court complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.404" offset="825031">Judge Wright in remanding said, “There may be a federal question lurking in the background, but it is not sufficiently disclosed -- disclosed by petitioner's state court complaint and at present is not a substantial one.”</text>
            <text syncTime="194.766" offset="882395">Upon the remand to the state court, the California Company and Lobrano who claimed under leases from the United States, joined the issue with petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.298" offset="924609">They challenged the jurisdiction of the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.290" offset="936521">They claimed that United States which was in effect they say being sued was an indispensable party.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.715" offset="962226">It had withheld its consent and couldn't be sued and also and finally, that the state court petition claiming the right to the possession of the minerals being wrongfully withheld, we say, disclosed no claim for legal relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.656" offset="1030040">In other words, that our suit, even if everything we said was true and all the documents that were attached were admitted as they read, we had no cause from a substantive stand point.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.847" offset="1078732">Those issues went before the District Judge in the state court, Judge Bruce Nunez.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.012" offset="1099421">They were exhaustively briefed and argued orally.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.057" offset="1111646">And ultimately, sometime later in March of 1954, he overruled all of the defendant's defenses and held in effect that petitioner's case was sound, both procedurally and substantively.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.566" offset="1177684">Six days before he ruled this present action in which this interlocutory order under review was issued, was commenced by the United States in the federal court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.444" offset="1229197">This is an action claiming on behalf of the United States, title to the same minerals, seeking to erase and cancel petitioner's muniments of title which are of record and asking, and this is what is at issue here, and praying for a temporary injunction against petitioner's prosecution of its state court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.566" offset="1305684">Immediately upon Judge Nunez's order, a ruling in the state court coming down six days after the suit commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.526" offset="1333478">The United States prayed for and obtained a temporary restraining order restraining any further prosecution that without notice of the state court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.180" offset="1380080">Petitioner met this federal court action for the injunctive relief by a motion based on three grounds, the motion to dismiss or rebate.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.457" offset="1417174">First, on the ground that it was argued prohibited by the federal anti-injunction statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.050" offset="1439535">Second, that it interfered with the previously acquired in rem or quasi in rem jurisdiction of the state court over the Reese and that the state court had been resorted to first, some seven months before this injunction suit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.147" offset="1491989">And finally, and in the alternative that since petitioner's claim that the minerals was based squarely and entirely upon an Act of the Louisiana Legislature, Act 315 of 1940 which I should come to in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.455" offset="1545174">And since the -- the claim of petitioner based upon that Act would involve or might well involve substantial federal constitutional questions and since the Highest Court of the State of Louisiana had not rendered a definitive interpretation of the statute against such a federal case, that this Court -- that the federal court, meaning the District Court that should stay at hand or abstain from deciding prematurely such a federal constitutional question under what has aptly has been termed by Your Honors, the doctrine of extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.890" offset="1686967">Those issues were presented to the District Court, briefed and argued and taken under advisement and Judge Wright after considering, denied petitioner's motion and entered a temporary injunction prayed for.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.237" offset="1740361">On appeal the Fifth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.036" offset="1751542">The decision of the court below, both courts below based on the proposition as contended for by the Government and by the other respondents that the federal court had exclusive jurisdiction of petitioner's claim of the United States claim for it -- for the property which is the same reason that's in controversy in the previously filed state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.722" offset="1834297">That the state court had no jurisdiction whatsoever and further, that the United States was an indispensable party to the state court litigation which had previously been filed by petitioner and which now stands enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.280" offset="1900544">The crucial and the chronological facts leading up to the legal questions of which are involved are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.118" offset="1927816">In 1935, an option was granted by the trustees of the estate of Joseph Leiter, deceased, to the United States covering this 8711 acres of marsh land in Louisiana for the future or -- or a possible future purpose of a migratory bird sanctuary or refuge.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.638" offset="2025932">In that preliminary act which is not -- was not recorded, that was the mineral reservation that in the event, the option was exercised and in the event the deal was made or consummated the minerals would be reserved under certain terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.810" offset="2082565">In 1938, December of 1938, Thomas Leiter, the sole heir of Joseph Leiter, deceased, actually made the deed, executed the deed and -- and consummated the deal and reserved the minerals under the land which of them -- which is the reason in controversy here, for an expressed term of 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.397" offset="2172949">Now, if I may digress just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.609" offset="2181831">Under the law of Louisiana, that the grant of reservation of minerals, creates non-ownership of those minerals as specific things apart from the soil which they underlie but under the law of Louisiana, the civil law, that concept of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.381" offset="2256854">It creates merely a servitude or an easement or -- or a right to go and explore for and produce those minerals which may underlie the land, which servitude a reason if not exercised for 10 years, expires by a prescription or a limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.216" offset="2340237">In 1940, a year and a half after Thomas Leiter made his reservation when he made his deed to the Government of minerals for 10 years, the legislature of Louisiana passed Act 315 of -- of that year, providing and Your -- if Your Honors care to read it that the -- the 1940 Act is quoted verbatim, page 45, appendix (a) in the petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.889" offset="2446921">It's very short, “Providing that where minerals are reserved in a deed to the United States affecting land in Louisiana and the minerals are reserved, such mineral rights shall be imprescriptible.”</text>
            <text syncTime="606.697" offset="2530200">In other words, they -- they will not as -- as were ordered otherwise or were previously would have happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.805" offset="2554546">They will not expire for none use or exercise, but they will remain permanently in the reserve order.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.732" offset="2586311">Now, Judge Nunez had this issue before and in the state court before he was restrained.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.349" offset="2608776">He decided in favor of petitioner on the question of the merit, you see because the California Company and Lobrano had put an issue, not only the procedure aspects but also the -- the merit of petitioner's claim which was expressly fixed upon the Act of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.714" offset="2674186">He took a middle ground which was something like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.821" offset="2686621">The Act -- the reservation as I have stated and if Your Honors care to make a note where the reservation appears in extent so it's page 46 of petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.274" offset="2724446">The reservation in three parts, in three separate places reserves those minerals for 10 years which is what the term would have been for minerals in an ordinary reservation, but for the Act of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.113" offset="2783796">There's another terminal data from which respondents rely on the merits which of course are not really at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.333" offset="2812740">The -- in the First Circuit set ups of the reserving clause, it is provided that the right of inquiry for these minerals will terminate or expire on April 1st, 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.648" offset="2873971">Remember, this is now the 5th of 19 -- December 1938 deed, six and a half years after the execution of the deed in the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.237" offset="2908348">There is this seeming inconsistent expiration date.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.793" offset="2926529">Judge Nunez concluded from the language of the deed and from the effect of the Act that the earliest and you can see the inconsistent terminal date or cutoff date related only to the right of inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.867" offset="2982849">It didn't affect the reservation of the minerals as a whole and he said that as to the mineral reservation at of the whole which was expressly for 10 years, the Act of 1940 suspended that prescription and made imprescriptible petitioner's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.578" offset="3041677">Well no respondents really make fun of petitioner's contention on the merits, although those again are not here before Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.746" offset="3070307">They say it would be absurd to say that you'd a right to enter or -- or explore for minerals if you didn't have a right to enter and explore for minerals, but that's not absurd at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.265" offset="3112417">If I'm -- I'm still digressing on the merits because respondents you see make or take great issue with us and present the merits of the case and it does here only on review of an interlocutory order of injunction, but we feel that we should at least present the issues not to Your Honor to show that Judge had -- Nunez had questions of substance before you, substance in deciding and in petitioner's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.387" offset="3212936">And so, it gives weight to petitioner's claims that -- of -- of title and the right to recover the wrongfully withheld possession that is certainly not a capricious or fictitious claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.316" offset="3256613">Judge Nunez in holding that the right of entry only expires and that the right to the minerals themselves were reserved and made imprescriptible is entirely consistent with what is known in the industry as directional drilling.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.746" offset="3314395">As -- as Your Honors no doubt, has known for many years it has been possible to explore a point, produce mines and minerals and from the Pegasus type without ever entering the premises at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.222" offset="3364237">The science had developed for years to such an extent that even though no entry at all in the premises to which the mineral rights apply -- mineral rights apply is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.648" offset="3410004">You may make a surface location and deviate from the vertical directionally as to angles up to 45 degrees and for distances along the horizontal plane for distances in excess of a mile.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.870" offset="3462875">So, it would be entirely consistent to say as Judge Nunez did, taking in an -- a contract interpretation approach here, that the right of entry expired, but the expressed reservation of the minerals for 10 years was effective and the legislature of Louisiana made it imprescriptible in an Act which was a validly an exercise of the public policy of the State to preserve the minerals for its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.815" offset="3578650">With that, the status of the case when the restraining order was granted, there had been a decision in the state court in this in rem or quasi in rem suit and it'd been a decision favorable to petitioner and that entire litigation is now enjoined at the hands of the District Court and that has received the approval of the Circuit Court for three reasons which we urge in our motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.365" offset="3676871">It is submitted by petitioner that the order below was incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.559" offset="3693589">At the threshold, the injunction was forbidden by the anti-injunction statute which I think if Your Honors want to refer to in its extreme degree, you're familiar with it, I'm sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.570" offset="3745625">It's on page 3 of petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.139" offset="3759940">It's now -- since 1948, Section 22-83 of title 28 of the United States Code and it reads, “A code of the United States may not stay proceedings in the state court, except as of -- expressly authorized by an Act of Congress or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction or to protect or effectuate its judgments.”</text>
            <text syncTime="941.354" offset="3868818">Of the three exceptions that are carved out of it by the expressed language of the -- of 2283, two may be laid aside immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.808" offset="3902568">First, there is no congressional authorization to the injunction below, respondent's point denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.050" offset="3939558">There is no judgment which is attempted that is beneath this issue it signed or executed which it attempted to be protected or effectuated.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.500" offset="3977383">Similarly, the phrase, the third exception where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction will not comfort or aid respondents here.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.788" offset="4022523">The purpose of the phrase in aide of its jurisdiction was included in the 1948 revision of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.865" offset="4058781">According to the expressed reviser's note, “To make it conform to another section of the judicial code and to make clear, the Court -- the federal court's recognized power to stay state court proceedings in cases removed to it, under the removal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.925" offset="4135058">Further, if as respondents say, that phrase of -- of -- in aid of its jurisdiction, if that were to supersede or allow it to overcome the anti-injunction law on -- on the ground that since the federal court has general jurisdiction of claims brought by the United States, if it completely in all respect supersede the anti-injunction law, because the language of the -- of 13-45 which confer it generally jurisdiction of the United States courts to in cases brought by United States is exactly phrased as is the regular diversity jurisdiction or in cases of general federal questions or as in 13-37, cases arising under any Act of Congress which regulates Commerce between the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.764" offset="4330454">So, if we were to say that merely because the United States Courts have -- have general jurisdiction, not exclusive of the suits brought to the United States, if that were to be allowed to -- to overcome the anti-injunction law, then you have no anti-injunction statute at all because the -- the act of conferring general jurisdiction on the federal court in cases brought by the Government is in the same language as all of the other is executed of jurisdiction upon the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.605" offset="4453752">And Your Honors, we say, held that very thing in a case which is if not precisely the same because the parties weren't the same is entirely parallel in its reasoning and as -- in as to its subject matter last year in -- in Amalgamated Clothing Workers versus -- versus Richmond Brothers, where although the United States do not bear a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.620" offset="4533896">Jurisdiction of the federal court was invoked under an Act that conferring jurisdiction upon the United States courts under 13-37, an act or an action arising on an Act of Congress relating to commerce between the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.959" offset="4603173">And the injunction sought for the federal court in Richmond sought to stay a state court proceeding where not only was it asserted that the state court had no jurisdiction, Your Honors held or assumed that the state court had no jurisdiction and that the state court was there invading an exclusive federally created domain of -- of labor relations as governed by the Taft-Hartley Law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1372.075" offset="5591646">We -- if we see the decision, this Court will nor permit a judicial departure from the clear-cut prohibition of the anti-injunction statute, nor will you accept the argument which respondents made that in -- in the 1948 revision say, accepted the -- the judicial gloss of this other erroneous decision and that they became part and parcel of what's established of the anti-injunction law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1699.917" offset="6902993">Here, we have a -- a -- the two types of cases, a state court case and a subsequent federal case, the nature of which is such that only one of the suits can proceed to final judgment because only one of the -- the -- the two sets, of course, can proceed to adjudicate and effectuate its decree in order to give relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1743.985" offset="7079267">It is no test of the Reese doctrine which is I say, has been for almost a -- a century and a quarter that the Reese, be in custodia legis or be currently under seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.005" offset="7135378">It is just -- the test is whether or not in the action, it will ultimately become necessary to control or dispose of or have jurisdiction physically of the Reese and that's the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.907" offset="7190967">Actually, the -- the whether the two actions qualify the nature in rem or quasi in rem so as to fit into the Reese doctrine it -- it's a matter of this real test and conceded below.</text>

            <text syncTime="1840.596" offset="7465775">The United States went into federal court subsequent to dependency of state court actions involving money there, a fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.732" offset="7494301">Here, it's mineral rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.782" offset="7502451">They claimed that the United States Court had exclusive jurisdiction to determine the Government's claim to this reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.177" offset="7532126">That there was really no -- no in rem case in the state court because the property wasn't in custodial lease, it was in personam at that junction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.594" offset="7565772">It further claimed that the sovereign immunity of the United States prevented it from being sued in the state court and that in effect, they were really suing the United States when they were proceeding against property, money that was, that the United States was claiming as its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.046" offset="7631600">All of those contentions would reject it unanimously with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.255" offset="7648423">The Court there held and this needs the fundamental argument of respondents in the (Inaudible) holding below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.373" offset="7676844">That the United States Court does not have exclusive jurisdiction of a claim by the United States to it -- to an interest in property or to ownership of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.359" offset="7720835">Further, that the doctrine of sovereign immunity was no bar to the application of the Reese doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.108" offset="7747793">They even said there, that the United States may intervene in the state court suits where these claims were being made against these banks, where the moneys were on deposit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.367" offset="7804844">As an actor, asserting its -- the Government's claim to this money with no sacrifice of its -- its dignity as a sovereign and with no reduction of its sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.001" offset="7859388">There again in the state court of New York where these two suits were pending in 1933 and 1934, the United States was not a party, because these Russian Insurance Companies and it's still surviving the record who had brought the state court actions claiming ownership of the record couldn't have sued the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.808" offset="7934621">If the absence of the United States in a state court proceeding where it can't be sued is -- is already in complete answer to -- to the Reese doctrine, then, it should never been applied to the United States at all and yet the doctrine in counsel, it forced to admit it under the Bank of New York case, the doctrine is fully applicable to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.323" offset="8032632">And if the -- the objection here which it was focused by Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question, that since the United States is not in the state court, it has no jurisdiction and therefore, the rule you rely on is -- is inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.091" offset="8103685">That whole question would never be presented because if the United States' absence was to be made a presence, was to made a test of the Reese doctrine, then it would never have been established as applicable to the United States in the fist place and for 20 years as I say the rule has been established and never modified that the doctrine, the fundamental doctrine which we invoke is applicable to the Government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.901" offset="8207026">Again, we say, we -- actually, if we stand where the Richmond Brothers case stands, we do not need to discuss, we think, the merits of the state court's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.687" offset="8258121">But even if we are required to debate upon the merits of the state court's jurisdiction of the case that's now there enjoined, we feel that we are on firm ground, both under state procedure in the state jurisprudence, and under the decisions that we think are controlling of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.837" offset="8326771">We think that the action was properly brought against these parties, who we say and allege are wrongfully withholding from us possession of our property.</text>

            <text syncTime="2409.971" offset="9743235">And that again was reaffirmed in -- in Land versus Dollar where the -- all of the stock or the controlling stock in the Dollar Steamship Line was at issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2430.581" offset="9825677">And the Court pointed out it there, just as it had pointed out then some 68 years previously in United States versus Lee that the United States will not be precluded by this decree from bringing its own action after the State, after this case has run its course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.869" offset="9890879">And so, we say that procedurally, if we're -- if we're forced into the area where we have to debate upon the merits, the jurisdiction of the state court, we say both under the Louisiana law, which we, of course, we've tried elaborately enough to agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.316" offset="9952632">And under that -- which we think are the controlling decisions here, we may proceed in the state court untrammeled by this injunction and to get a final judgment insofar as it lies within the power of the United -- of the state court to grant it, which of course, would fall short of being a binding adjudication upon the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3204.596" offset="12921710">Well, I'm not sure that that's a deplorable consequence at all because -- particularly in this case where the law of Louisiana is unique.</text>

            <text syncTime="3226.847" offset="13010735">And I don't think the Constitution contemplates it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.004" offset="13019408">In fact, I think that the Constitution denounces it because in matters of local land law, the -- the laws of the separate states have always been considered entirely supreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.339" offset="13064756">And finally, with respect to these deplorable consequences, I should like to refer to Mr. Justice Miller's language in the Lee case which in a similar manner, 75 years ago, the same deplorable consequences were predicted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3269.576" offset="13181680">But if the existence of such laws is to be made upon their capacity to withstand such criticism, then the whole fabric of the law must fail.</text>
