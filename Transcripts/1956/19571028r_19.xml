          <turn speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="18.444" stopTime="399.435">
            <label>Mr. A. L. Wirin</label>
            <text syncTime="18.444" offset="73770">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.800" offset="83174">This case as the preceding one and as the one to follow, deals with a subsection of Section 401 of the Nationality Act of 1940 which involves a loss of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.686" offset="146704">The subsection here is 401 (c) which provides the loss of United States citizenship by an American citizen who serves in a foreign army and who at the same is a citizen of that foreign state.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.779" offset="235102">We have raised the constitutionality on its face of this subsection in our brief and since the constitutional question has been argued substantially in the former case and will also be considered in the next case, I am not going to discuss that feature of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.773" offset="319007">I'm going to address myself particularly to what Mr. Justice Frankfurter indicated with the due process features of this statute as applied to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.381" offset="369476">I'm going to assume the power of Congress to legislate in the field, (a) of persons serving in a foreign army abroad, (b) where those persons have dual nation -- dual nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.724" offset="422870">I'm going to assume the -- the making of broad power and I'm going to urge upon Your Honors that that power was not properly exercised so far as this case is concerned because it was exercised in a manner to be unreasonable and to offend due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.692" offset="490684">More particularly, to narrow my point and to narrow the problem, I'm going to be dealing with a question which Mr. Justice Harlan has with respect to the matter of in -- of voluntariness and involuntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.113" offset="548362">And I want to make at the very beginning a distinction which to me seems to be cardinal in connection with the use of the word “voluntariness or involuntariness” because it can be used in two separate contexts and with two separate meanings.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.781" offset="615027">For instance, whether or not a person, when he does something, intends to lose his citizenship or as one of the cases that concurs in the loss of his citizenship by doing something.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.980" offset="675840">This is one example of voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.574" offset="690260">For the purpose of my argument, I'm going to assume that this is utterly inconsequential and that in that context, he may lose his citizenship though his -- though he -- he doesn't want to, though it is involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.955" offset="751804">But when Congress undertakes to specify various grounds for the loss of citizenship which it did in this -- Section 401 of which (c) is an -- an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.517" offset="794018">And it provides that merely doing that which Congress says, if done, results in loss of citizenship.It is clear and it is undisputed by the Government that that Act which Congress defines must be voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.832" offset="855249">For instance, if it's a question of service in the Armed Forces of another country, the Government concedes there could be no loss of citizenship if the service was involuntary, if the service in the Armed Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.377" offset="909479">So in that respect and in this narrow fashion, voluntariness is important, it is conceded and it is the heart of the petitioner's case so far as this -- this case is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.305" offset="961202">Because we say that in the trial below under Section 503, the trial court in ultimately ruling that the petitioner voluntarily served in the Armed Forces of Japan, ignored and violated the rules laid down by this Court as to the quantum and burden and nature of the truth which is upon the Government where the stakes are deprivation and forfeiture of this most precious of rights, the rights of citizenship, that the court below laid down an incorrect rule of law as to where the burden of proof was.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.787" offset="1131102">It followed an incorrect rule of law so far as any presumption that might follow upon a showing that the petitioner -- the petitioner served in a foreign army or developed conscription and that in any event, the court below ruled against to the petitioner without complying with the standards imposed by this Court in connection both with persons who were citizens by naturalization or by birth, namely that the evidence against the petitioner and in favor of the Government, is not clear and convincing and unequivocal to warrant the forfeiture of this precious right.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.757" offset="1294942">Now, fortunately, we have here a record of some 40 pages, not the 15,000-page record to which Your Honors wrestled with in -- in Gates versus United States and the record is before Your Honors and in a moment I want to refer to it.I mean the record of the trial as compared to our brief, it is some -- some 40 pages in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.967" offset="1391804">First, with respect to a couple of propositions of law and then I want to deal with these propositions of law as reflected by the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.147" offset="1440496">We say that where the Government says that an American has lost his citizenship by virtue of doing something which so far as the citizen is concerned, is not accompanied by any knowledge on his part that he is forfeiting or abandoning or affecting his citizenship that as a minimum, the burden of proof that the petitioner has committed the act proscribed and set forth in the statute, voluntarily that that burden is upon the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.286" offset="1589081">Now, additionally we say --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="399.435" stopTime="405.543">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="399.435" offset="1597649">It's sort of an exception to the rule as if would be in ordinary cases, other types of cases?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="405.543" stopTime="1293.632">
            <label>Mr. A. L. Wirin</label>
            <text syncTime="405.543" offset="1622100">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.329" offset="1625234">We say it is not exception to the rule in other types of cases that are analogous.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.600" offset="1642371">We say it is the rule because we say that this Court has defined expatriation as the voluntary renunciation or abandonment of United States citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.004" offset="1692003">This is the phrase that Chief Justice Hughes used in (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="427.170" offset="1708617">We say that the act of expatriation, that's what's involved here, losing your -- your citizenship, is an act which must be voluntary in order for it to consist of an act of expatriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.750" offset="1782909">And if the Government says, I -- anyone here, has lost his citizenship and has expatriated himself, it must prove that the act which the citizen committed was voluntary and not involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.060" offset="1836199">I think -- in other words, we say one of the elements, one of the inherent and indispensible elements of expatriation is voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.329" offset="1873293">The burden of proof on which is upon the Government, the same that it has a burden of proving that -- that the person did -- did something which the act proscribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.051" offset="1916134">So we are -- we do not say that we're asking for an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.804" offset="1927210">We're simply saying that this is part of the definition of voluntariness which -- which is inherent in the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.852" offset="1963363">But in any event, even if we're mistaken about that, there's a serious question in this case with respect to the presumption which a court should draw, we say must draw, where in a case like ours, the -- excuse me, the evidence of the petitioner as a citizen of United States, born in United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.352" offset="2049358">The evidence is that he served in a foreign army but that he served solely by virtue of conscription, that is, you received an order from a foreign army to -- to appear for induction.We say and we think all of the circuits with the exception of the Circuit below in this case take the view that upon that showing, there has been a showing by the petitioner of involuntariness and that the burden then shifts to the Government to -- to rebut the presumption of involuntariness which that showing makes, and this was the showing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.568" offset="2198256">But then we say finally -- well of course, I'm not proving my argument.Our -- our central point is that irrespective of where the burden of proof is, assuming now, I'm entirely an error and assuming I'm merging upon Your Honors which I believe I am not, an exception and that we're wrong about it and that the burden is upon the petitioner in a general way to carry his burden of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.980" offset="2303896">We say that all of the evidence, some 40 pages, if looked at by the Court will bring this Court as a minimum to have a troubling doubt as to whether there were sufficient evidence to justify the forfeiture of -- of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.434" offset="2389682">And in Baumgartner and other cases, Your Honors have reviewed judgments both by trial and appellate courts, findings against the citizen, Baumgartner a naturalized citizen and Gonzales, the last nationality case argued before Your Honors which you decided per curiam.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.303" offset="2469198">When born in United States, you've taken the view -- and in -- in Gonzales, you cited Baumgartner that if Your Honors look at a case, even though it comes here in case in the armor of finding by -- by lower (Inaudible) both of them and you have a troubling doubt as to whether there should have been a forfeiture, you will reverse the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.389" offset="2549551">Let me go on to what the facts are in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.332" offset="2565224">As I've said, one, this boy was born in the United States and was an American citizen by virtue thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.319" offset="2605244">He was also a dual citizen by virtue of no conduct on his part, by virtue of nothing that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.391" offset="2641502">He was a dual citizen because the Government of Japan, prior to the war, said by its laws that every person born in United States of Japanese ancestry was a citizen of that country.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.202" offset="2700748">He was a dual citizen because -- he was a dual citizen without his knowledge or consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.488" offset="2725930">Because his father, in accordance with the practice, of thousands of Nisei in the United States, before he was 14 days of age, went down and registered -- registered his name in the Koseki or in the -- or in the Japanese family register.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.816" offset="2803252">He got his education in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.920" offset="2811611">He's a graduate of the University of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.566" offset="3070224">He went to Japan in 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.077" offset="3070119">He had no ties in Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.171" offset="3070015">He went to Japan as thousands of Nisei went to Japan at the request of their parents, their passage paid by their parents to secure some education and to have a visit.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.159" offset="3069910">He went there for the purpose of staying two to five years temporarily and his passport application -- and his passport shows it.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.570" offset="3069806">He went there as an American citizen and only as an American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.620" offset="3069701">He had no time either here or in Japan ever asserted any right as a Japanese citizen or claimed any privilege or desired any benefit because he was a Japanese citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.084" offset="3069597">It is urged by the Government that when he went to Japan in 1939, he knew that he was a Japanese citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.470" offset="3069492">The record does not support that.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.087" offset="3069388">The record is to the effect that when he was in Japan, he discovered that he was a dual citizen solely because his name was on the -- on the family register.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.741" offset="3082867">He was then under no obligation to render any military service in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.335" offset="3101257">The United States conscription law hasn't been passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.215" offset="3120797">He couldn't have known that he was endangering his citizenship when he went to United -- when he went to Japan or when he was conscripted in the Japanese Army because the Nationality Act which provides for your loss of citizenship wasn't even adopted at the time he went to -- he went to Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.955" offset="3191745">He was being supported by his father.And one thing he couldn't foresee is that his father would die three months after he was in Japan to leave him penniless.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.946" offset="3243781">And in 1940, he received a notice from the Japanese Army to appear for a physical examination, and in March 1941, he was ordered -- inducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.665" offset="3294563">Now, we say this was involuntary, just as involuntary as this Court has often said when a person received the subpoena and he appears as a witness, he isn't appearing voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.822" offset="3335210">He is appearing under coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.491" offset="3345868">And the decisions have been uniform in the recent years that where a service in a foreign army is under coercion, it is not the kind of voluntary conduct which is indispensible to warrant a forfeiture of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.759" offset="3398949">Mr. Justice Harlan, let me make one further explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.162" offset="3420578">The argument that a citizen's rights can be taken away from him completely involuntary, namely, that if he serves in a foreign army and he is conscripted in a foreign army and is coerced by physical violence in a foreign army that nonetheless he loses his citizenship and that 401 (c) so provides is the very argument that Government made some years ago in a case known as Dos Reis versus Nicolls which we cite.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.210" offset="3528829">And the Court -- Court of Appeals there rejected the argument that it is either constitutional or -- or believable that Congress no matter its authority to -- over foreign relation and no matter his legitimate concern to prevent conflicts between his country and another, that Congress could go to that extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.493" offset="3605943">The court in Dos Reis versus Nicolls didn't say it.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.233" offset="3616914">It wasn't going to say it now, a Justice of this Court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.688" offset="3630707">The point is that this would be offensive to common decency and -- and elementary fair play.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.392" offset="3657561">So that we say up to this point, the evidence of involuntariness was reasonably persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.971" offset="3691833">We say that it became conclusive as a result of further testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.278" offset="3713045">This boy testified -- well let me perhaps withdraw that and -- and develop the argument this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.291" offset="3745123">The trial court found against the plaintiff, against the petitioner, and he did so, we think, as a result of a -- of a misapprehension as to the duties of a citizen living abroad and a misapprehension after the applicable rules in this kind of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.531" offset="3818057">The trial judge was at the view that this petitioner lost his citizenship, although there's no question he was conscripted into the Japanese Army because the petitioner refrained from doing certain things which he think what the judge thought a citizen should do.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.977" offset="3883886">In the first place, the trial judge was at the view that the petitioner should have returned to the United States instead of staying in Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.660" offset="3918576">We think this is utterly unrealistic and quite unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.359" offset="3933414">In the first place, we wouldn't then not at war with Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.699" offset="3946789">We didn't even have a conscription law.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.979" offset="3959850">The United States Government has recognized dual citizenship as Mr. Justice Frankfurter said a few -- few moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.062" offset="3988167">There he was in Japan and he got a notice to serve in the Japanese Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.928" offset="4007706">At that time, there wasn't -- such service was not inconsistent with any allegiance he had to United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.853" offset="4035396">And certainly, he cannot be charged with the lack of prescience to foretell that a couple of years afterwards, there would be a war between United States and Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.939" offset="4071654">He'd made no effort to return to this country but he explained the reason he didn't is because he was penniless, funds from his father had stopped, he went to work and he was earning 70 yen a month, $15 a month and he didn't have the fair to get home so he stayed on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.810" offset="4147200">And of course if he attempted to leave after he got a notice to appear for physical examination, well, certainly the same thing would have happened to him that happens to Americans who try to leave to -- to evade -- evade the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.826" offset="4203207">The trial judge held it against him that he didn't do one other thing -- didn't do three other things, that he didn't go down to the United States Consulate and assert his rights there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.696" offset="4250749">And there are two answers to this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.253" offset="4260989">One is that he -- as he testified, had a friend who worked in the embassy and the United States Embassy point to this friend who do nothing for persons who were in Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.877" offset="4319504">Some intimation, some claim, had made by the judge and some intimation appears in the Government's brief that had he gone down to United States Consul, the Consul could have granted him some relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.514" offset="4374047">The fact of the matter is as we point out in our brief that the State Department had formally announced that it would not help any persons in Japan who were being drafted in the Japanese Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.231" offset="4428904">Furthermore, he testified that he didn't protest to the Japanese authorities because he was afraid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.138" offset="4464536">And he was afraid not only of the penal sanctions which accompany this -- the -- the conscription law of Japan but he was afraid of extra penal sanction by the Kempei Tai, the Japanese Military Police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.651" offset="4526602">That -- he knew that the boarding house where he was living had been visited by the Japanese military police and that he had heard rumors, he didn't know whether they were true or not that persons who attempted to evade the Japanese military system, this is 1940, this is while Japan is under control as we -- we -- which is a matter of common knowledge of a -- of a ruthless military cast that he had heard that the Kempei Tai had pursued some persons who are evading the draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.427" offset="4665678">And in one instance they suspected that a person was hiding in a trunk filled with straw and they bayoneted the trunk and killed the person who was in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.252" offset="4716983">Now, he didn't see this but he was afraid of it and we have submitted to the clerk of this Court, documents, official report of the United States Government through SCAP, Supreme Command of Allied Headquarters -- General MacArthur's Headquarters with respect of the conduct of the Kempei Tai so far as the Japanese people generally were concerned and particularly the Nisei who were -- who were living in Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.374" offset="4833489">Now, the judge went further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.773" offset="4842998">The judge said that when this boy went to Japan -- went to Japan, he went there for the purpose of doing his hitch in the Japanese Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.236" offset="4884898">There isn't the slightest evidence to warrant any such finding of any such opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.617" offset="4906423">The difficulty as I view it with the judge below if I may be both superstitious and serious at the same time, is that he gave too much credit to the University of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.663" offset="4966609">This boy has graduated from the University of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.615" offset="4982387">And because he was a graduate from the University of California and went to Japan when -- when he was 23, this Judge said, "This boy is a bright man."</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.681" offset="5030661">He said he is a graduate of one of our greatest institutions of learning in this country and so he proceeded to a court to this petitioner and knowledge of political affairs or wisdom pertaining to them and oppressions of possible conflict between United States and Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.310" offset="5113208">As a result of which, he felt -- this boy knew more than he -- than met the eye and therefore, he arrived to the conclusion that he must have known many things which -- which were not clear and therefore, he lost his citizenship.</text>

            <text syncTime="1719.698" offset="6878772">Our position is that even if whatever -- whoever has the burden of proof, if you just look at Nishikawa's own testimony which is all that there is in this case, it is sufficient to find that his entry into the -- into the Japanese Armed forces was voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.508" offset="6941989">Let me go if I can to the -- the facts in this -- in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.270" offset="6961006">But before I do, I would like to stress the fact because I think that Mr. Wirin did not emphasize it for reasons which are clear from his point of view that the trial judge did not believe Nishikawa's testimony that he was frightened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.812" offset="7019207">He did not believe his testimony that he stayed -- that he refused to do anything to keep himself out of the Japanese Army because he was afraid of the secret police or afraid of anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.828" offset="7063301">Now, this was a man who appeared before the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.559" offset="7074168">He was a witness on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.917" offset="7079602">And the trial judge said explicitly, "I do not believe his claim that he didn't -- that -- of -- of tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.776" offset="7111053">And whatever may be the power of a court, of appellate court to review findings of fact by a trial judge in an expatriation case, certainly, the -- the credibility of the witness is still within -- in the hands of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.351" offset="7177404">This Court said that in a denaturalization case, the (Inaudible) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.259" offset="7192973">They said that credibility still remains with the District Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.438" offset="7205721">And so, if I may, I would like to state the facts in this case in that light.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.634" offset="7226514">The facts, most of which I shall state first, are undisputed, was that he -- he was born in the United States in California, went to the public schools here, went to the University of California, got an engineering degree and graduated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.434" offset="7277714">In 1939 -- in August 1939, he went abroad to Japan at the instance of his father, paid for by his father for the purpose of studying in Japan for a period of two to five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.967" offset="7327765">He did not know Japanese written characters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.545" offset="7338109">He hardly knew Japanese is a spoken language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.710" offset="7346782">He did not know written Japanese.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.729" offset="7354828">When he got over there, he hired a tutor for the purpose of studying written Japanese.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.869" offset="7375412">Shortly after he got over there, he apparently got there let's say in August 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.371" offset="7393384">In November 1939, his father died and his testimony was that he then was cut off from -- from income from the United States and he had to take a job which he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.357" offset="7433404">He took a job in an airplane plant which he kept until he was inducted into the Japanese Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.242" offset="7456914">Now, the District Judge also made a very specific finding of fact and these findings of fact that when Nishikawa left the United States in August 1939 to go to Japan, he knew that Japan was at war or had hostilities in Manchuria and that he knew he was liable to be drafted in the Japanese Army, that he knew he was a Japanese citizen as well as an American citizen, that he had dual nationality as Mr. Wirin is said.</text>
