            <label>Mr. Mark D. Eagleton</label>
            <text syncTime="30.732" offset="226304">This is an action that was brought in the St. Louis Circuit Court for damages suffered on behalf of the petitioner, James C. Rogers, while in the employ of the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company at Garner, Arkansas on July 17th, 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.790" offset="318568">It was brought under the terms and provisions of the Federal Employers' Liability Act on this -- in the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.580" offset="345736">Both parties conceded that the plaintiff and the defendant that lower courts level were subject to the provisions of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.375" offset="388890">The plaintiff, the petitioner here, proceeded to trial on April 12th, 1954, and for three days following that, recovered a judgment by the Court and the jury in a sum of $40,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.090" offset="459734">And after judgment have been entered, the defendant in that case, the respondent here, Missouri Pacific Railroad Company appealed to the Missouri Supreme Court, which reversed the judgment outright holding that the petitioner had not made a submissible case.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.597" offset="541759">Thereafter, this Court granted certiorari, bringing us here because of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri was final as of that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.178" offset="596093">We contend the petitioner that the ruling of the state court was wrong, not only because it was in the teeth of the decisions of this Court, but because it based its decision on facts that were not warranted inferences and facts not warranted either by the evidence, the submission of the case or the instructions granted by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.058" offset="703613">The whole answer to the case will have to be found in the facts, and while they are somewhat extensive, they are simple in their very nature, and I will as quickly as I can, with the chronicle -- chronological order, attempt to give Your Honors a review of those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.701" offset="782190">In this particular case, the plaintiff, petitioner was 24 years of age at the time of his injury on July 17th, 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.135" offset="827956">He'd been employed by the Railroad Company some six or seven weeks prior to that particular injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.080" offset="855646">At the time they were working at Garner, Arkansas on a roadbed and track that ran in general direction, north and south, the north bound track or the east track was for the north bound trains and the west track would be necessarily for the south bound trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.351" offset="932760">There were only two tracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.198" offset="940178">They cover the space when laid down on the ties and the ballast in between the ties are some 15 or 20 feet, which might be referred to as the roadbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.212" offset="1000260">The work the petitioner was doing was the burning of weeds along the western side of this north and south track.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.136" offset="1039966">These weeds have been prepared for burning previously by having then sprayed by chemical the purpose of which was indeed cause the weeds to dry and to be ready to immediate ignition when they're torched or some force of that kind was applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.401" offset="1128991">A particular torch that he was given to do this work was a rather improvised quart can of oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.856" offset="1158771">It had two spouts, one on either side coming out on a 45-degree angle in one of which spouts rags serving as a wick.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.762" offset="1202448">They were -- were placed and on the other spout of this 45-degree angle was inserted a stick or handle about three feet long.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.297" offset="1240586">The particular place of work which becomes important here was about 250 to 300 yards north of what is called the Garner Crossing.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.698" offset="1294190">And the work intended was to burn these weeds which for the most part were to the west of the petitioner as he would work from south to north.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.982" offset="1347271">In other words, he would be working on the west shoulder of this right of way.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.315" offset="1368586">The shoulder itself was defined as being a space beginning with the western edge of the ties and extending to the west about three to three and a half feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.397" offset="1412995">And if we look further to the west, we go down to his left as he goes north or to his west side as to what is called a dump, which is lower than the roadbed, which is up above it.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.271" offset="1464508">Now, the weeds were about two and a half to three feet in width to the west of his shoulder and extending in part down into the dump.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.483" offset="1505259">He would take this ignited torch and apply it to these specially prepared weeds for burning.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.412" offset="1545070">On this particular case on how he succeeded with that job and how he'd gone along without any difficulty, he would have gone up to the culvert which is in question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.359" offset="1600763">In that culvert, it was 253 yards north of the Garner Crossing where he started all of his work.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.232" offset="1628348">He remembers on the west side.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.737" offset="1638275">And after getting to the crossing, he would then have gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.876" offset="1650918">He didn't get there, but he would have been have gone 200 yards further to the north on the west side at which time he would then cross over to the east side to do his further work.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.567" offset="1693654">I mentioned that because in addition to the job of burning the weeds, he was a section man and the defendant through its foreman imposed on him and the others the duty of watching for the trains whenever they went by for hotboxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.384" offset="1780903">Apparently, that was a paramount consideration because the foreman told him that -- and told all of them, “When a train goes by, drop everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.570" offset="1829700">Put down everything and watch the train for hotboxes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="435.709" offset="1846209">And the foreman went further and said that the crew should divide their works so that some would be on the east side and some on the west side so that necessarily, they can watch as the train went by the hotboxes on the west side, which would be equally important with the hotboxes if any on the east side.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.584" offset="1925726">It so happens and the record show this fact that at the time of plaintiff's injury, the petitioner's injury he alone was on the east side.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.163" offset="1968044">Every other member of the crew was on the -- he alone was on the west side, I beg your pardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.347" offset="1992808">Every other member of the crew was on the east side so that -- and he had nothing to do with assigning those other men to that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.208" offset="2028231">He was merely assigned to do this work himself, but he was explicitly told to watch that train for hotboxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.380" offset="2060936">So, he goes along with his torch and he sets fire to the weeds on the west side and was told to stand on the west shoulder, to stay along the west shoulder.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.248" offset="2104404">He was told not to cross or attempt to cross to the east in front of the oncoming train which of course would be hazardous in and of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.356" offset="2140766">But he was particularly advised not to cross because the -- the noise of the oncoming train would deafen the sound of another oncoming train, if one would come from the opposite direction, so that he couldn't cross to the east.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.415" offset="2201057">He couldn't cross to the west because that's where he was burning.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.643" offset="2213909">He was burning to the left of it and the west on the shoulder and the -- down into to the dump.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.395" offset="2237001">He couldn't go back to the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.154" offset="2244002">That's the direction he was working from, from south to north.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.668" offset="2258004">The only avenue of escape from the fire once it was started would be to the north.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.624" offset="2281827">And so, he goes along with his work and the understanding was that when a train was coming before a gap to the crossing, the foreman would yell “train” and would usually yell in the south bound or north bound.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.964" offset="2343267">But in this particular instance, it is not of great significance, but it is in -- a fact nevertheless, that the foreman did not yell “Train!”</text>
            <text syncTime="569.714" offset="2382242">He didn't give the customary notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.225" offset="2392273">It would only be important in showing how the time was consumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.824" offset="2406693">He didn't give him that notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.594" offset="2413798">And the first that the petitioner knew that a train was coming was when he heard the whistle at the crossing, some 200 yards away from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.794" offset="2446503">Mindful of the admonition that had theretofore been given him to watch the train, he started running away from the fire which had been set to the north and he ran as far as the culvert, which was 30 to 35 yards from the point where he was last working when he heard the train.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.732" offset="2530304">When he gets to the culvert, by that time, the train has overtaken him and the engine has already passed him by.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.437" offset="2561128">Now, the engine is on the north bound track so that its engine on the -- because its pulling on the north bound track.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.963" offset="2591222">It is 15 to 20 feet east of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.956" offset="2603238">He sets his torch down at that point, turns to the east so it's the -- watched the hotboxes and when three or four cars going at the rate of 35 to 40 -- 30 to 35 miles an hour, which would be at the rate mathematically of 51 to 59 feet a second.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.638" offset="2689964">That's purely mathematics.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.770" offset="2698428">In that 51 to 59 feet, it's like three cars go by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.431" offset="2717132">And by that time, he feels the heat of the blaze on his face.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.309" offset="2740642">As he carries his hip, it seems his eyebrows are seamed.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.593" offset="2761749">He throws his left hand over his eyes and quickly backs up six or eight feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.456" offset="2785155">And when he backs up at least six or eight feet, he has caused to fall down the embankment and suffers injury because that particular portion of the culvert onto which he backed was sloping and had loose gravel on it which he says was never permitted ordinarily to be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.633" offset="2853909">That was kept flat and leveled so that such a man would have a safe place to walk.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.114" offset="2875852">Now, he didn't know the sloping gravel was there, as a matter of fact, because when he -- the only time he was ever up at that culvert.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.269" offset="2904482">This was the first day he had ever done that job in his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.902" offset="2919006">It was the first time he'd ever seen it done.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.195" offset="2932172">He'd only had this torch complete the total of 30 to 35 minutes according to the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.753" offset="2954428">He runs out there immediately apply his attention to the east to watch this thing that only takes two to three seconds for three cars to go by.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.519" offset="2993403">He feels the blaze, backs away, then down he goes.</text>

            <text syncTime="732.335" offset="3032691">What happened was that the train and the evidence shows, the train caused the north air disturbance to firm up the blaze and back upping to the south and to cause it to envelop him and to come up on top of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.429" offset="3097057">Now, he was asked by counsel, “Didn't you know that the train passing would cause wind?”</text>
            <text syncTime="755.875" offset="3126836">And he said well he thought it would cause wind in the direction it was going, which was to the north, but he did not know that it would cause the blaze to come over the wind, to come over far enough to involve the blaze to the west.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.987" offset="3179290">In other words, at 15 feet or 20 feet, he was standing on the shoulder, there was a track intervening a southbound track between.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.721" offset="3206248">So that we say that -- that under the evidence, the very, very simple facts that these facts are -- are practically without dispute, the form and everything I could -- any part of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.243" offset="3256299">It was referenced to telling the man where he had to stand, said, stand on the west shoulder.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.438" offset="3277093">That's where he stood.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.354" offset="3284825">The foreman never said, “I didn't tell him to stand there.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.385" offset="3296946">No other witness said he shouldn't have stood there.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.318" offset="3308648">No other witness said that he did a single thing that wasn't right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.155" offset="3327979">He did exactly what he was told to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.382" offset="3336861">In fact, if you examine the facts, you'll wonder what else he could have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.703" offset="3354206">Having in mind that there was a duty imposed on him to watch this train,” and the foreman never says, “He wasn't supposed to watch the train, that he could avoid that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="824.507" offset="3401435">Although, counsel suggested that he might well ignored the train and has he ignored the train which he was trying to do, he's trying to do his job which the foreman told him to do and which the foreman doesn't deny.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.246" offset="3456397">He's trying to do his job, but the counsel said that he ignored the train and watched the fire, he wouldn't have burned.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.012" offset="3483460">That isn't even true.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.820" offset="3490670">He could've ignored that train and he just stood there and watched the fire, just look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.240" offset="3512299">He was burned back to the face, turned himself up and then looked and watched that fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.333" offset="3536750">It would have burned with him watching it just as much as would if he was not watching it.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.681" offset="3554095">The train had caused the air disturbance with just as much and envelop that he just stood there.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.633" offset="3573948">The only difference is, either burn to death while standing there and watching it.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.475" offset="3597249">There wasn't anything he could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.905" offset="3602996">He had no magic.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.990" offset="3607280">He had no wand.</text>

            <text syncTime="1002.966" offset="4115205">First of all, the petitioner was given a task to perform, a several task of firing those weeds and only those weeds which had been affected by a chemical weed killer and had dried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.487" offset="4181347">He testified that they were -- that he had a place about three feet wide to walk at where there was no fire on the -- on this next to the track.</text>

            <text syncTime="1038.717" offset="4258252">And in his own words, he burned just spots of weeds of a distance of about two and a half to three or three feet to his left.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.167" offset="4300048">In other words, he just set his torch out there as he walked along.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.260" offset="4316453">He testified he got along all right with the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.164" offset="4332022">The next thing that happened was that he heard the train coming and blow the whistle crossing south of Garner Crossing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.674" offset="4370056">Ordinarily, the foreman calls the train, but the foreman was about 400 yards off the road putting in ties with the rest of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.015" offset="4399417">That train caused him no surprise and he said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.738" offset="4414360">When he heard the train however, he quit his firing, in his own words, he quit firing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.304" offset="4436616">Left his work and ran to the culvert which he knew was there, which he saw it was an open and obvious culvert and stood right next to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.648" offset="4481964">Stood there while the train in his own words went -- was until -- the train was about a half or two-thirds of the way by.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.649" offset="4513938">During this time, he watched the train for hotboxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1125.151" offset="4604008">However, he was examined on that point and he said, affirmative to them, that he knew his job on that day was to watch and tend the fire.</text>

            <text syncTime="1247.972" offset="5095215">The fact that he did so, certainly, doesn't -- and did so to the -- in such a manner as that he would not know where his fire was burning is what is important in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.189" offset="5144116">The fact is that he was sent out here and -- and I'm reminded of -- of the times when I was a young boy in St. Joseph, Missouri, and we break the leaves out into the gutter of the street in the fall of the year and set fire to them along the gutter of the street, and cars would go by and fan those weeds from time to time, and we'd stand out there with a rake and scoop them up into piles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.752" offset="5230425">Now, certainly, that if -- we know that as this fellow did that the passing vehicles are going to cause some -- some impetus to the fire, but we can't say -- say it because we watched cars go by, that that's the reason why we ignored the fire which we had set and which we knew was there and there was no one else and that he doesn't claim someone else should've told him or advised him that this fire which he had set was approaching him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.051" offset="5339617">All he had to do was look and see, and that is what the situation is so far as the Missouri Court's opinion is concerned here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2835.069" offset="11443597">Had they come in to Court and said that he was compelled by these concurrent and conflicting duties which changed a normally safe manner and method and place of work into a dangerous or unsafe one, then I think he would and -- and submitted a sufficient evidence along the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.493" offset="11533354">I -- I don't agree with the -- with the construction, but they can be argued that way and -- and submitted it on that proposition and relied upon it, then of course we'd have a different case entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.341" offset="11588733">But that's the precise answer I give to this statement of his that he did not rely on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.973" offset="11611303">He's relying on all up here, but he didn't rely on it down there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.187" offset="11628126">He relied on the loosened sloping gravel as -- and hopes to show that was a dangerous or not reasonably safe condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.965" offset="11655189">And his evidence wasn't sufficient for it, so the Missouri Court held and I think rightfully -- rightfully so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.700" offset="11682147">He relied on the fact that he was required to work alongside this railroad track where all section men incidentally have to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.624" offset="11717883">There's no two ways about that with a hand torch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.596" offset="11733765">And yet, he was unable to say how or in what manner this method of setting the weeds enhanced the danger of the fire as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.546" offset="11773576">Now, it doesn't and accordance with what Your Honor has -- has been touching on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.660" offset="11798026">Actually, the method of work, the method of causing this fire or burning the weeds had actually nothing whatsoever to do with the acts to that such because the fellow left what was pleaded to be the dangerous method of work and ran 34, 35 or 40 yards ahead of it and stood there and in his own words as -- as he -- as he testified as how the accident happened, he says, “I thought I was far enough ahead of the fire to where I wouldn't -- wouldn't --“ he says, “At the time I thought I was far enough or away, I was pretty far enough to clear myself of the fire or any danger of the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.494" offset="11981302">And it was time to start to watch these journals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.354" offset="11992795">So, I sat down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.607" offset="11997811">I set down -- set my torch down on the end of a tie.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.680" offset="12010141">I was standing out on a flat surface, watching a train go by.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.653" offset="12029994">After the train had gotten approximately half or two-thirds of the way, I felt this heat on the side of my face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.064" offset="12059669">I turned to see what had happened then it was fire right up in my face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.193" offset="12076178">I threw my left arm over my face, started turning to the west, to the north, backing rapidly away from the fire and that is when I walked in on this culvert and slipped and fell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.803" offset="12118601">So, you see, actually, the hand torch and what was pleaded against us was of no significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.518" offset="12141484">The fact of the matter was it was the fire there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.203" offset="12156217">Now, it wasn't in the danger of the fire enhanced by the method of setting a fire which as alleged to be negligence in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.801" offset="12194565">He was away from the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.090" offset="12199685">He went completely away from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.102" offset="12207731">He stood there and ignored it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.922" offset="12215045">Presumably, you said he was up there because as Mr. Chief Justice Warren has pointed this other order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.732" offset="12246288">But he said he did not construe that order to mean he should ignore this fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.660" offset="12266036">He stood there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.602" offset="12269798">He could've looked right to his right and seen what was happening to the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.402" offset="12289024">He could have moved across the culvert.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.506" offset="12301354">He knew the culvert was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.036" offset="12307519">He knew he was standing next to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.861" offset="12314833">He knew that -- that he was between the culvert and the fire which he had left.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.782" offset="12346493">And therefore, I submit that if the evidence does not come up to say that the concurrent and conflicting duties caused him to ignore the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.032" offset="12387453">He didn't so contend by his own words but if it be said that there was a jury proposition involved in that respect then I frankly submit to this Court that that was an element which should have been pleaded and submitted.</text>
