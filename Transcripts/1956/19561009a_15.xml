            <text syncTime="19.683" offset="78681">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.092" offset="96340">This case of Yates versus the United States is a contempt case arising directly out of the Smith Act case which was just argued before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.672" offset="158616">Mrs. Oleta O'Connor Yates was one of the defendants in the Smith Act case and was the only defendant who testified in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.009" offset="212010">Now, there were three contempt cases, three separate cases of contempt arising out of this case, all on behalf of the petitioner, Yates.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.418" offset="265613">These three cases are so closely interrelated that I'm going to take a little time to give a rather complete summary of the facts of all three of these contempt cases even though this Court is only concerned with one of the three cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.278" offset="341055">And I think that when you have heard the statement of facts as it concerns all three of the cases, you will see why it has become necessary for me to feel that I must burden the Court with discussing two cases that are not even before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.962" offset="403749">At the time that the prosecution rested its case, all of the defendants with the exception of four defendants, rested their case without putting on any evidence at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.861" offset="459442">Mrs. Yates was one of the defendants who chose not to rest but to put on a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.981" offset="483892">And she took the stand as the first witness for the defense.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leo Branton, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="128.006" offset="512000">Yes sir, she is the only one.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.658" offset="522553">And she testified for approximately nine days on direct examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.222" offset="552856">During which period of time, she testified fully and completely about everything that she had ever done as a member of the Communist Party, why she joined the Communist Party, what she did as a member of the Communist Party, what's her interpretation of the so-called classics were and how she felt in what her intent was so far as her being a member of the Communist Party was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.228" offset="652852">On the first day of cross-examination, she was examined by the prosecutor until it reached a point why she was -- where she was asked questions for a number, all of which called for her identification of other people not on trial as members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.737" offset="746893">She refused to answer any of these questions which called for identification of these people as members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.719" offset="778867">And in doing so, she stated to the Court that she admits no disrespect, but that she felt in these times, the times on which the case was being tried that to identify a person as a member of the Communist Party might bring upon that person prosecution, persecution, illegal violence, the loss of a job, and the loss of many of the other privileges which citizens who are not a communist enjoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.288" offset="897149">She was ordered to answer those questions by the trial judge and she answered in effect that as much as she would like to answer those questions as grim as the consequences might be for her refusal.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.318" offset="961202">She could not bring herself to be an informer, that she felt that this was what the Government witnesses had been doing in the case and consequently she couldn't add to this kind of testimony and consequently hurt anyone else no matter how much disposition might hurt her.</text>

            <text syncTime="261.635" offset="1046465">As to the first four questions, all of them were people, three of the questions concerned one individual who was not a defendant and one of the questions concerned a -- one of the defendants who had already rested his case and her refusal as to that particular defendant was that he had rested his case and consequently, he had no opportunity to meet any evidence according to the record it has against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.109" offset="1152418">And she felt that she would be an informer in identifying him as a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.376" offset="1173420">So as to all of the refusals, we get down to the one single thing, she would not identified people as members of the Communist Party.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.706" offset="1342798">At the time of her refusal to answer these questions, the Court held her in contempt as to each of these four separate refusals.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.931" offset="1371638">And he ordered her to custody for the -- until she answered such questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.198" offset="1392744">Now, all of the defendants at that time were out on bail so that she went to jail and during the rest of her time on the stand and during the rest of the trial indeed, she came to the witness stand and she left jail and she went back to the jail where she was incarcerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.555" offset="1450214">Now, things were a lot smoothly again for two other days and then finally of the third day, apparently, when the prosecutor was lagging in his cross-examination, the trial judge told him to hurry along, that he was wasting time.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.225" offset="1508833">Then again immediately, upon this -- having received this admonition from the Court, he started asking for names again.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.490" offset="1541956">He asked 11 other questions, all of which were designed to elicit one thing, the identification of other people not on trial and of some the defendants who had rested and against whom she had previously indicated she also would not answer the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="555.416" offset="2221662">I'm saying that I -- that my argument that these questions were irrelevant is a tenable argument on my part but that because of other matters which are more important and more significant in my opinion would be called for a reversal of this contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.336" offset="2281326">We did not urge that particular point before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.504" offset="2302015">Now, when he ruled, the trial judge ruled that he would view this contempt as criminal contempt he postponed action on it, until after the trial was over.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.645" offset="2354573">As the result to the experience which took place concerning Mrs. Yates and her being held in contempt, no other defendant took the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.824" offset="2391249">The defendants rested their case at the end of Mrs. Yates' testimony and she was in jail 43 days under the judgment of civil contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.322" offset="2433254">Now, when the jury found each of the defendants guilty on August 6, on August 7th, the trial judge sentenced each of the defendants to five years plus $10,000 fine which was the ultimate that he could give at that time under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.182" offset="2508696">On the next day, he found -- he sentenced Mrs. Yates on the criminal contempt, the 11 counts of separate contempt which he had found previously and he sentenced her to one year in jail on each of the 11 counts, but that 11 counts to run concurrently, but with the sentence not to begin until the termination of her sentence under the main case.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.499" offset="2613917">In other words it was not to begin until she has spent her five years that she has been sentenced to under the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.376" offset="2641502">Now these defendants all filed notice of appeal and the Circuit Court ruled that there was a substantial question and ordered the trial judge to set bail, the trial judge refused to set bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.135" offset="2696464">We went back to the Ninth Circuit and they themselves set bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.065" offset="2712242">We went back and posted bail on behalf of each of the defendants, but the martial would not release the defendant Yates even though $20,000 bail had been deposited in her behalf on the ground that he was still holding her pursuant to a judgment of civil contempt by Judge Mathis.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.349" offset="2797296">Now, at that time, the trial judge was away and anther judge was sitting.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.038" offset="2816104">This judge released the petitioner Yates with the understanding that she would report back two days later to see what Judge Mathis wanted to do concerning his judgment of civil contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.514" offset="2870021">It was our argument incidentally that at the time that the trial terminated, the finding of civil contempt terminated and there was no longer any power for the court to hold her pursuant to that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.873" offset="2911399">So two days later, we went back before the trial judge and the trial judge rules and he wrote an opinion as a matter of fact which holds this language, the language which I am about to recite that even though the trial was over, the litigation had not terminated because there was an appeal pending and it maybe that the Government would need the benefit of those answers on a new trial or at sometime in the future as long as the appeal was pending, the Government had a right to those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.883" offset="3031458">And consequently, she could not be released from jail at all as long as an appeal was pending or any part of the litigation was pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.935" offset="3063641">From that, we filed a notice of appeal and asked the judge to set bail and he refused to set bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.550" offset="3090181">Again, we went to the Ninth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit set $1000 bail on this contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.348" offset="3109303">After we got the petitioner Yates out on jail on $1000 bail, Judge Mathis again for the third time ordered the petitioner Yates to come back before his court.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.158" offset="3148591">At this time, he said to her, “It appears that my sentencing you to civil contempt had no effect whatsoever and consequently I am now going to view that civil contempt, the original four-question contempt as criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.227" offset="3204807">Now I sentence you to three years in jail for this civil contempt.”</text>
            <text syncTime="806.105" offset="3224346">So that at this time, we now have three contempt, first a filing of civil contempt from which the judge would not release the petitioner from custody on the basis that the Government still had a right to answers and incidentally in our opinion, this would have been a life sentence or at least she would have been in jail until today 1956 because we still haven't terminated the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.157" offset="3300624">And the one year sentence for the 11 counts and the three-year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.076" offset="3316297">Now, all three of this contempt led before the Ninth Circuit, as to the judge's ruling that the civil contempt was still enforced in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.441" offset="3357675">They reversed this and reversed it naturally on the logical ground that at the termination of the trial, there was no longer any power for the Court to coerced the answers, the trial was over and the answers could no longer be given, so that was reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.688" offset="3418697">As to the three years sentence of contempt, the court also reversed that and they reversed that on the basis that it was a violation of due process for the judge to first hold her in civil contempt and for her to spend 43 days in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.631" offset="3494452">And then 30 days after the termination of the trial informed her for the first time that he was doing that civil contempt as criminal contempt and consequently, that also was reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.064" offset="3540219">The one-year sentence was affirmed and it was affirmed on the ground that the 11 questions of the third day of cross-examination constituted a separate incident of contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.669" offset="3602599">They gave no reason why they reached the conclusion that this was a separate contempt from the first four days and this is the contempt which brings us before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1046.260" offset="4185025">The only answer that I can give you at this time sir is that we are appropriate of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.238" offset="4204878">Now, our first point that we urge upon the Court for reversal is the fact that there was never but one contempt in this case if there was any contempt at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.767" offset="4255033">Now keeping in mind the fact that the Ninth Circuit proved that the only reasons they affirmed the -- this contempt was that they viewed this as a separate contempt and they are completely solid as to one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.123" offset="4308428">The only thing that we can suppose is the fact that they viewed it as a separate contempt because it arose on a separate day from the other four questions, because even the Government admits in their brief before the Ninth Circuit and also their briefs here that the questions were substantially the same questions that they called for substantially the same answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.580" offset="4406230">Now, the law is I believe that once an accused in a contempt case states an unequivocal position, once that person shows a singleness of attitude or an identical nature for a ground of refusal, that there can be no multiplication of contempts by the prosecutor or jointly putting questions to her which will call for the same answers and there are many cases along this line, I think the Costello case is one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.822" offset="4535275">In the Costello case, the witness in the beginning said that he would not testify at all.He absolutely refused to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.456" offset="4569757">Following that, the questions were put to him which called for various answers, did he know (Inaudible), did he know Frank Moran, did he know other people and the Court held him separately in contempt for the refusal to answer all of these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.889" offset="4635481">And the Court in reversing said that there was only one contempt because of the fact that the witness had stated unequivocally that he would answer no questions and that the prosecutor could have been in contempt a thousand times by asking a thousand different questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1682.359" offset="6729352">Now, our second point is this, that even though the trial judge labeled this one year contempt as criminal contempt, it was really civil contempt because as this Court well knows the difference between the two kinds of contempt is one is punitive and one is coercive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.771" offset="6799047">And it makes no difference how he labels it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.863" offset="6811376">It's what his purpose was in giving the sentence that makes it either civil or criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.550" offset="6834155">And we say that even though he labeled a criminal contempt that the purpose of this contempt was to coerce the answers and why do we say that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.799" offset="6871144">Because at the time of the first contempt, he used such phrases as, it would not be fair to preclude the Government on this situation to establish that relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.796" offset="6911164">To borrow language from some of the cases, you carry the key to the jail at your own pursuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.217" offset="6928823">You may purge yourself at anytime in order to discharge yourself from custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.367" offset="6945437">Now, this was the time of the contempt which unquestionably was civil contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.846" offset="6967380">However, at the time of the second contempt and this is the contempt of which we are here concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.647" offset="6990576">The judge still used the language which indicated that he had one purpose and one purpose alone, not to punish the defendant in order to vindicate the authority of the Court, but to coerce the answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.660" offset="7038537">And his statement at the time of sentencing under this, when he allegedly called it criminal was as follows, "I had hope by this time that Mrs. Yates might be willing to purge herself that she might be prompted to do so."</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.410" offset="7093603">Now, the Government was entitled on cross-examination to show if they could -- what -- the person that Mrs. Yates said impliedly said was a foolish person, was a friend of Mrs. Yates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.154" offset="7140519">We don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.308" offset="7140415">That's the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.362" offset="7145430">And finally he said, "I hope Mrs. Yates will yet purge herself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.881" offset="7163507">I am not interested in imprisoning Mrs. Yates."</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.240" offset="7180957">Now, the fact that the judge made all of these statements showed that the judge was not concerned or was indicating the authority to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.465" offset="7209796">He was concerned with getting the answers to those questions and this intent, and this motive and the judge might even carry it over into the third contempt at which time she had -- the case was over, he had it over 30 days and he called her back and his questions to her at this time was, “Do you wish to answer the question?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.713" offset="7286805">You could have been (Inaudible) Mrs. Yates by answering the questions, if you were disposed to purge yourself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.840" offset="7311360">The Court will entertain a motion to modify not only this sentence but even the one-year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.818" offset="7335184">Now, we submit that in the Court making all of these things, the Court showed -- even though the Court was been held that it could then coerce the answers for the benefit of the Government because the Government have the right to those answers once the case was over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.887" offset="7383458">We say that it showed that the court's only purpose was to coerce the defendant, Yates by answering the questions and since the kind of a sentence that he gave, even though he labeled it criminal was for this purpose and this purpose alone, it was civil contempt and not criminal contempt and consequently, the one year sentence was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.945" offset="7455765">Now, I only have a few more minutes and I wanted to discuss point three which is the excessiveness of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.582" offset="7482305">We believe that the sentence is so inhuman and so cruel as to give violation of this defendant's constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.547" offset="7526087">In the first place, we must consider that we are dealing with the question of summary contempt and the tremendous possibilities which this power gives to a judge to abuse the judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.995" offset="7575928">The history of the contempt shows how the courts have jealously guarded this and every time a case comes down in history since the time of the judge next trial, this power of contempt has been restricted and restricted and restricted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.735" offset="7630890">And there's a reason for this, because of the fact that it -- any criminal contempt case doesn't have any of the benefits of the Bill of Rights such as the -- the indictment or jury trial, or right of cross-examination and such things as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.770" offset="7679060">And consequently, we believe that the power which the judge should use should be only the minimum power which is adequate to protect the dignity of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.398" offset="7717512">And we submit that after the defendant has spent 43 days in jail at the time the trial was over and they spent additional time in jail because of the trial judge's refusal to obey the orders of the Ninth Circuit to meet that she stayed in jail 70 days altogether and not 43 days that then to give a sentence of one year in jail on top of this was cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.893" offset="7807478">And especially considering the fact that by taking this attitude, the defendant was only adhering to a position which could not possibly have hurt the Government but only hurt herself, because the jury was obstructed that they could take in a consideration her refusal to answer these questions and testing her own capability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.594" offset="7878322">The jury knew that she had refused to answer these questions and she was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.023" offset="7896085">Also, the questions which she were asked were questions which -- on which the Government have been put in affirmative evidence that every one of these persons was members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.351" offset="7937358">Now, what could avail the Government to have to come out of this defendant's mouth, the fact that these people were members of the Communist Party?</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.726" offset="7966824">None of the defendants of the trial and none of the counsel disputed for a moment that these people were members of the Communist Party, but yet they sentence her to a one year in jail because of the fact that she adhered to this position of conscience from the very beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.256" offset="8020950">And finally on this regard, I want to say that this sentence of one year is grossly under proportion for what any of the States here can say, the contempt of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.515" offset="8074031">The majority of the states provides for a maximum of only 30 days on this kind of contempt and the defendant had already spent 70 days in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.788" offset="8107050">None of the States exceed six months for this kind of contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.399" offset="8121574">And even in the -- under the federal system when the process contempt was permitted, not on the premise of the Court, there is a six months limitation to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.596" offset="8162325">And the final point of the excessiveness of the sentence in this regard Your Honors will be presented by my colleague, Mr. Wirin.</text>

            <text syncTime="2053.078" offset="8212271">Mr. Wirin.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="a_l_wirin" startTime="2053.936" stopTime="2978.331">
            <label>Mr. A. L. Wirin</label>
            <text syncTime="2053.936" offset="8215719">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.710" offset="8226795">The thrust of my argument will be with respect to judicial policy or as Mr. Justice Frankfurter, the judicial iniquity, namely that the sentence in this case was in the federal statute of this case so unduly harsh and severe as to make it appropriate for this Court to invoke a general supervisory power or to the administration of justice generally in the District Court and in connection which contempt subject to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.552" offset="8354168">And therefore, I want to call Your Honors attention on a number of facts that I hope you will find.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.085" offset="8384261">In the numerous prosecutions under the Smith Act throughout the country, Mrs. Yates is not the first defendant to refuse to give names.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.049" offset="8428147">The first defendant was in the famous, the famous Kennedy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.805" offset="8451135">Mr. Gates was a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.497" offset="8461897">The trial judge, Judge Medina is not known as the stock dealer on Communist or Communism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.541" offset="8494080">We know what the trial judge did there as to the defendants and even to the lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.555" offset="8514142">But as to the matter of refusal to give names, Judge Medina considered it adequate to the situation to impose a sentence of 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.814" offset="8555207">When the (Inaudible) case was heard before Judge Chesler, Judge Chesler considered 30 days adequate to the situation then.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.730" offset="8602854">When does a similar matter arose before Judge Medina in the case of (Inaudible) enforcement in effort upon it, particularly familiar, there again Judge Medina thought that the authority of the Court on the one hand could square with the rights of the individual on the other by a sentence of 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.481" offset="8689894">Indeed, Your Honors will be interested to know the defendants were proud to learn there that in the Smith Act case in St.Louis, Judge Parker, when the prosecutor asked the defendant's name, refused to judge that defendant in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.729" offset="8766903">Now, the imposing of severe sentencing upon defendant in the Smith Act case who takes the stand to his defense and presumably in defense of the remaining colleagues who have not rested, the taking of the stand by a defendant in the Smith Act case is an important aspect of the right of defendant regarding essential charge involving him and who ordinarily better than the defendant can testify to their intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.241" offset="8908904">But if -- when a defendant who under our administration of justice has the right to assert a defense attempts to do so and then find himself confronted with severe, serious, harsh penalties because a refusal it had made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.029" offset="8984033">It may not very well mean anything, the deprivation of the right to defend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.890" offset="9003468">You got it from Mr. Branton, that once Mrs. Yates was given this sentence, it became obvious to the defendants that they were in a very serious situation, they had already set four and a half months in jail because this judge wouldn't grant bail and no matter how they come to this Court and again back to the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.315" offset="9085179">They anticipated this judge would be harsh to them as the sentence he imposed the maximum submitted by law, five years and $10,000 on each defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.202" offset="9128751">And so, no other defendant took the stand when they saw what was happening to their colleagues, Mrs. Yates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.718" offset="9154769">And therefore, it is a serious matter in the administration of justice and for difficult cases where persons are charged with advocacy of certain kind of opinions for anyone of the defendants to find himself not only facing the maximum sentence permitted by the Smith Act but also facing severe additional sentences keep on to him to serve at the end of the time that he serves his full five-year sentence as a price for asserting the right of putting on a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.171" offset="9288620">Now, there are other considerations of judicial policy that I call to your attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.168" offset="9320594">Mrs. Yates said, she would not make names and identify communists because of the harm that will come to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.906" offset="9359569">The time in the history of America was 1952, the place was California, for her to identify communists at that time and that place and possible indictment by the Department of Justice under the Smith Act meant probable harassment by the federal and state investigating committees, meant certain loss of public and private employment in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.917" offset="9475657">She's on the court and she could not bring herself to give names and identify persons and hurt them because she said she could not bring herself to become a government informer and the judge so understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.391" offset="9533544">He said, "Mrs. Yates does not want to be an informer."</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.932" offset="9551726">What is the significance of her refusal to answer questions on the grounds that you'd become an informer again in 1952 and in the Smith Act case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.147" offset="9600522">She had suffered a number of months as a defendant in this case and have -- had observed the Governments witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.269" offset="9633019">Every single witness called by the Government was a paid informer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.856" offset="9655380">What is -- what was a paid informer?</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.958" offset="9667814">They are in two categories, they are those who are full-time, in the full-time employ of the Government and received compensation, so far professional witnesses like John Lautner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.759" offset="9719014">There are others who work as it were by the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.654" offset="9730612">They are called to testify in particular cases and they give their testimony in such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.480" offset="9753913">I suppose it's the reasonable inference that if the testimonies they did in one case is helpful to the Government in that case, the likelihood of further peace work of their being called for further testimony is the greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.062" offset="9812219">The informants are also in this case, perhaps divisible into other categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.958" offset="9835729">There are those who went into the Communist Party at the pay of the Government and there are those who became terminals and who in the pay of the Government turned out more paid to the informers against their former colleagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.950" offset="9903752">The evidence in this case discloses that the witnesses of the Government received the sum of $48,303.02 prior to their testimony in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.781" offset="9959027">She had seen and heard these Government witnesses, these informers, the like of which she rebelled against being on the witness stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.562" offset="10006152">She had heard John Lautner to help the Government state that the defendant Richmond, was seen by him at a convention of the Communist Party in 1945, when the fact was that Richmond was serving his country -- our country to the Armed Forces overseas during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.372" offset="10097476">She had heard an informer (Inaudible), identified the client whom I represent in that case (Inaudible) as having been seen by him at a meeting of a Communist Party in Los Angeles in January 1951, when the fact of the matter was she was in jail, in custody because she couldn't furnish the bail which the trial judge was demanding at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.703" offset="10198727">She had heard an informant who's tried to testified that the Communist would start revolution and would use guns and discover that at the same time contemporaneously when (Inaudible) testified he had heard a defendant make that statement, it turned out within the report of the F.B.I. the statement which the defendant was suppose to have made was that there would be a revolution by the fascists not the communists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.652" offset="10330593">And she had heard and informed the rest will testify that he was in the employ of the F.B.I. that he made friends, that he induced his friends to join the Communist Party and then he turned those days over in pursuant of his employment to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.816" offset="10407184">Now, it is true, Your Honors, that 1952, Mrs. Yates did not have the patience to anticipate that this very Court, this very last term would look upon a record in which there was testimony from informers and consider it so endangered as to require remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.159" offset="10484611">And certainly, she did not have the patience then to know that in this very Court, this very term, in the very next case which is to be argued, the Solicitor General of United States is suggesting to this Court a tainting of a record by virtue of the irresponsible if not but the jury's testimony of a paid informer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.724" offset="10570815">But if she didn't have the questions, she did have some history in which her resistance to giving names was mooted, and let me faithfully advert to a page or to up history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.545" offset="10666109">It is generally known that in the 1920's, when Mr. Mitchell Palmer, was Attorney General, the number of outstanding Americans objected to the then raid against Communist because of the use of informers by the then Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.165" offset="10744581">The gentlemen included Professor Chafee of the Harvard Law School, be impound of that school and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.157" offset="10776555">And there is the historic decision by Judge Anderson in (Inaudible) to which Mr. Justice Frankfurter had referred in the opinion of this Court in the Galvan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.918" offset="10827651">A case in which Mr. Chafee and others appeared amici before Judge Anderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.277" offset="10849071">It was Judge Anderson in the 1920's said, "That no honest man would be a Government informer," referring to the informers, in the employ of the Department of Justice, and the irresponsibility of their testimony during the 1920's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.125" offset="10924408">And since I am turning to history and have given Your Honors a page with respect to matters in 1920, permit me to turn to page back even further to 1798 into the alien and sedition laws to which the Chief Justice had occasioned to refer in a footnote in Pennsylvania against Nelson, to which Mr. Justice Holmes had occasioned to refer in the dissent of (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.565" offset="11030256">When the alien and seditions laws were proposed in this country, happily they were at existence only two years, this statute has been upon the statute books since 1940 and it's being widely enforced currently as Your Honors know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.966" offset="11087830">But on the alien and sedition laws were for adoption before Congress, Mr. Edward Livingston arose in the hall of the Congress and he made this statement about informers to which I call your attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.345" offset="11161287">He said, "The country was swarmed with five informant, delators and all the odious reptile tribe that breed in the sunshine of despotic power."</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.356" offset="11217398">Now, I hope Your Honors do not consider that I am overstating the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.385" offset="11237460">But what I am saying is that what Mrs. Yates was saying here she could not stoop to join the class of this reptile breed which a class which has been held in odium throughout the ages in every land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.377" offset="11329411">For she said, "I cannot bring myself to do that," meaning I cannot bring myself to become a paid informer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.107" offset="11368385">For she said if she did, "I would be going around hanging my head in shame the rest of my life," and she felt she couldn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.710" offset="11406838">Of course in current history, we have other examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.031" offset="11420108">Your Honors will recall that (Inaudible) on part or before a committee said, "I will tell about myself but I will know no names of my -- of any colleague."</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.240" offset="11460859">And Mr. (Inaudible) has just currently taking -- taken the same position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.006" offset="11483951">In short, there are many Americans of high courage and self-conscience who are unwilling to becoming informers and to name colleagues as communist when there maybe reprisal upon them no matter the price they pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.403" offset="11565558">Now, I have said and I offer no (Inaudible) that her position was as we see her position rooted in history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.486" offset="11613936">And now, I want to suggest that her position was rooted even deeper to that in history and was rooted and bottomed in conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.611" offset="11662420">She said and the record showed, page 29 that when she explained her inability to testify, it was because of conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.428" offset="11721665">Judge Mathis so understood it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.991" offset="11731905">He said her situation was analogous to that as the Jehovah's Witnesses who take the position because they believe the word of God requires them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.267" offset="11777045">So, he recognized that her position was on -- based on conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.193" offset="11800764">Indeed, let me call Your Honors attention to what she said and then to another historic example and I shall be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.553" offset="11838171">She said in all conscience, I cannot do otherwise than adhere to this clear determination of hers not to name names which will result her in harm to those who she named.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.786" offset="11907135">The other historical example --</text>

            <text syncTime="3030.217" offset="12120816">Therefore, I want to give Your Honors this -- this final example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.262" offset="12149029">Perhaps Your Honors will recall what it was that Martin Luther said or did when he arrived at his views and he was -- when he was called for trial, the Diet of Worms, the Diet of Worms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.451" offset="12209737">He had arrived at his (Inaudible) and he took a nail and he pounded the nail and the document upon which his views were expressed on the church door at once.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.074" offset="12276193">And he said -- and I -- I credit this to Mr. -- to Judge Hand in United States against Helen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.809" offset="12307226">He said I neither can nor will recant anything, since it is neither right nor safe to act against conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.034" offset="12348082">Here, I stand, I can do no other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.705" offset="12362815">Now, it seems to me that Mrs. Yates completely without her realizing what she was saying and whose great words she was in effect, "That she was taking essentially the same position," for as caution is the central pieces of my position that the struggle for freedom of conscience is the same everywhere and at all times and often finds its expression even in the same words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.478" offset="12481829">Now, this Court has on numerous occasions beginning with the Chief Justice Hughes in his dissent in the McIntosh case which finds acceptance in the opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas for this Court in the (Inaudible) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.169" offset="12556643">That it will seek to accommodate the authority of the State with the demands of conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.016" offset="12587990">And my argument is that that accommodation maybe arrived at by this Court by reversing the present judgment which will mean that the -- that Mrs. Yates had served seven days in jail for her refusal to have -- 70 days in jail for her refusal to have given names of colleagues of hers who might be penalized or otherwise suffer if their names were given.</text>
