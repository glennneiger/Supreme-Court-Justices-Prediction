            <text syncTime="20.701" offset="186180">Mr. Farr.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_f_farr" startTime="22.426" stopTime="99.835">
            <label>Mr. Warren F. Farr</label>
            <text syncTime="22.426" offset="193076">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.610" offset="201853">The basic issue in this case is the same as in the other two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.269" offset="220453">Namely, may a federal court compel performance of an agreement to arbitrate future disputes in a labor contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="40.468" offset="265279">And the answer to that question seems to me must turn on whether the 1925 United States Arbitration Act requires such a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.692" offset="314180">Because as the court below held, as the Fifth Circuit held in the Lincoln Mills case, as the Seventh Circuit held in the Galland-Henning case, as every other Circuit Courts that I know of which has faced this question has held, unless you find the right to compel arbitration in the United States Arbitration Act, you can't find it in Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.377" offset="420864">Mr. Feller has demonstrated the difficulty, the confusion that inevitably arise from trying to rest and find in 301 the power to compel arbitration of a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.757" offset="474363">So, I think they must first consider the United States Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.286" offset="488469">First, I might point out briefly the facts in this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="99.835" stopTime="109.902">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="99.835" offset="502680">Did I understand you to say that -- that all those who sustained the enforceability of the arbitration provision have rested it under the Arbitration Act?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_f_farr" startTime="109.902" stopTime="1222.423">
            <label>Mr. Warren F. Farr</label>
            <text syncTime="109.902" offset="543013">As far as I know, every Circuit Court which has enforced it has done so by virtue of the Arbitration Act, like the First Circuit and the Fifth Circuit rejected 301 as itself being the source of power to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.641" offset="609886">The present case like the other two cases rose on a complaint under 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, and the -- the union sought to compel specific enforcement of two grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.841" offset="674774">Those grievances are set out in the amended complaint at page 44 and 45 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.166" offset="708002">The grievances were two.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.304" offset="712600">One, that an employee named Boiardi was not being paid the rate of pay which he was entitled to under his job classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.299" offset="756590">And secondly, that an employee named Armstrong had been improperly discharged and not for cuase.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.831" offset="790653">Arbitration was demanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.436" offset="797132">The company refused the arbitration on the ground that the issues were not arbitrable under the collective-bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.153" offset="820015">The union brought suit seeking specific performance and damages on a motion to strike the claim for specific performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.519" offset="861497">The District Court held that it lacked power to enforce arbitration because of the provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.534" offset="901517">After that decision the complainant, the union, then amended its complaint to strikeout the claim for damages so that its cause of action would ask only specific performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.537" offset="949478">It did so that it might have an immediate appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.068" offset="963688">The Court of Appeals reversed, holding first that the Norris-LaGuardia Act was not at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.860" offset="994826">Then it said, but it isn't enough to say that the Norris-LaGuardia Act is not at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.089" offset="1015724">We must find some affirmative basis on which compulsion of arbitration can be rested.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.094" offset="1043728">Now, they said we can't find it in the common law because it was long settled common law that enforcement of executory agreements to arbitrate would not be compelled in the federal courts or in a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.255" offset="1100361">They turned then to section 301 and they say no, we can't find in 301 such a power.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.487" offset="1129305">But we do find a statute which authorizes it and that is the United States Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.315" offset="1156681">And they held that this contract was a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce within the meaning of section 2 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.939" offset="1203179">They held that it was not excluded from the operation of the Act by virtue of the exception contained in section 1 of the Act, which excludes contracts of employment of seamen, railroad workers, or other workers engaged in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.205" offset="1276217">And then they said this being covered by the Act is not excluded from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.612" offset="1297847">We have the power -- or the District Court has the power under section 4 of the Act to compel arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.905" offset="1330970">Section 4 providing that a court of the United States which has jurisdiction of the controversy between the parties apart from the agreement to arbitrate may compel specific performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.039" offset="1387499">So in the -- you might have heard that in the Court of Appeals and after argument the union made a motion to amend its complaint to set up as a basis of jurisdiction diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.338" offset="1460746">The Court of Appeals denied that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.340" offset="1476733">And whether the denial was correct or otherwise, I think it's not at this time before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.106" offset="1503796">Now, we turn then to the United States Arbitration Act to determine whether this case is within it.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.153" offset="1544025">The United States Arbitration Act was proposed in 1922, 1923 shortly after New York had enacted its Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.356" offset="1588746">We've traced the history of that Act on pages 13 to 22 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.416" offset="1609017">Shown there it was sponsored by commercial interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.801" offset="1626572">It was -- it was -- the proponents were commercial trade association.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.129" offset="1651858">But there's not a word in the committee reports or in the argument on the House floor and the Senate floor showing this was anything other than the Commercial Arbitration Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.406" offset="1696998">But that's not all, because Congress didn't merely not consider, the applicability of the Act to labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.134" offset="1735868">It specifically did consider it and specifically rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.833" offset="1754676">Mr. Feller pointed out that (Inaudible) found that the provision with respect to compelling arbitration was objectionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.877" offset="1806921">That it would -- it -- it met -- it was the same -- it met the objection that labor had always had up to that time through compulsion on arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.722" offset="1854255">So, the provision excluding contracts of employment was written into the Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.066" offset="1891662">The -- that exclusion was put in reflecting at that time the general hostility and fear of labor to the equity courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.608" offset="1941817">We have to consider this was 1923.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.207" offset="1960208">At that time labor unions were bothered about the equity powers of the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.306" offset="1980583">But then the yellow dog contract, the extension of the Sherman Act, the other matters which this Court referred to in its opinion of yesterday with respect to the enactment of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.381" offset="2024887">Labor was afraid and it would not have met -- it would not have satisfied labor had this agreement of the statute applied to their agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.190" offset="2068146">Now, it is said, the Court of Appeals said this does -- covers only individual contracts of hire with contracts of employment means only individual hiring.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.554" offset="2113599">I might say that the Court of Appeals, First Circuit with the exception of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is the only court that should've taken that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.637" offset="2145886">Now, what is this contract, if it is not a contract of employment?</text>
            <text syncTime="515.527" offset="2165530">To be sure, a collective-bargaining agreement does in hierarchy?</text>
            <text syncTime="520.565" offset="2185592">It's not the hierarchy.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.070" offset="2191653">But what is a man's contract of employment?</text>
            <text syncTime="525.082" offset="2203669">It's not merely the fact of being hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.415" offset="2213073">It's the terms on which he's hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.541" offset="2221537">It's his compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.968" offset="2227284">How long he has to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.004" offset="2235434">What are his rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="534.266" offset="2240449">That's what anyone would normally think of as meaning -- as being a contract of employment and it's well accepted, perfectly well accepted that the provisions of the collective-bargaining agreement are read into the contract of hire of every single employee under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.501" offset="2305337">This Court said so in the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.621" offset="2321847">As a matter of fact, this Court itself in the Sand case, 306 United States, which it quoted in the Senate report on 301 which Mr. Feller read you this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.877" offset="2370853">This Court said that the legislative history of the Act, referring to the National Labor Relations Act, those hardly indicate that the purpose of the statute was to compel employers to bargain collectively with their employees to the end that employment contracts binding on both parties should be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.103" offset="2451832">This Court in 1939 was satisfied that that was an appropriate characterization.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.119" offset="2475865">And we submit that, of course, it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.889" offset="2490911">Now, it won't do to say that all Mr. (Inaudible) was bothered about was the individual hiring.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.689" offset="2530095">He specifically adverted to what would happen if a union made a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.212" offset="2560188">And in the very analysis of the bill referred to in the -- the same as union convention, in his analysis of the bill he points out and I refer to the extracts from his analysis printed at page 46 of the respondent's brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.051" offset="2635525">He said, “What about those who seek to protect themselves through mutual aid?”</text>
            <text syncTime="638.738" offset="2658304">Some organizations are very strong and a union may enter a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.784" offset="2682546">If they show into an -- into an agreement containing an arbitration clause there can be little doubt that the organization will be bound, but would such action bind the members?"</text>
            <text syncTime="654.386" offset="2720893">And he concludes that it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.148" offset="2731969">And indeed that was argued this morning and as I think I must fully agree with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.474" offset="2753285">And as the courts have consistently held the provisions in a collective-bargaining agreement with respect to grievance procedure and arbitration are binding on the individual employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.840" offset="2818696">What good would it have done -- have done therefore?</text>
            <text syncTime="681.972" offset="2831235">Would Mr. Feller's set purpose have been accomplished if all that was excluded from the Act was an arbitration clause in the rare end where there was an individual contract of hire, but it was not excluded when it was included in the terms of the collective-bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.659" offset="2910020">It seems to me perfectly plain, therefore, that to give any effect to that proviso it must apply to the arbitration clause whether in a collective-bargaining agreement or in the rare case of an individual contract it had such as in the Shipping Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.417" offset="2985044">Now then, it maybe said that although the collective bargaining agreement is a contract of employment, it is not a contract of employment of a seaman, a worker engaged in commerce in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.264" offset="3076472">In our case, we have production and maintenance employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.933" offset="3095071">And some courts have said that the only collective-bargaining agreements which are excluded -- arbitration clause which are excluded are those relating to transportation workers, persons engaged in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.137" offset="3151914">That is to say, therefore, that what Congress intended to do was to provide for the nonarbitrability of collective-bargaining agreements with respect to workers engaged in commerce but to leave open and subject to arbitrability the collective-bargaining agreements of workers who are engaged in industries affecting commerce or producing goods for commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.361" offset="3256822">There is not the slightest suggestion in the legislative history or any place else or as to why that distinction should be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.610" offset="3293811">So that we submit that clearly this agreement is a contract of employment and a contract of employment which is therefore excluded from the Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.367" offset="3352848">Now then, Congress, therefore, in the Arbitration Act made up its mind that it was not going to provide for the enforcement of labor contracts -- enforcement of arbitration in labor contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.366" offset="3436857">Commercial arbitration, yes, but for reasons of policy it decided against making specifically enforceable provisions in a labor contract, a contract relating to the employment of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.573" offset="3501641">That was the position it took in 1925.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.472" offset="3525256">It is said that it reversed that position, in 1947, in enacting the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.517" offset="3561409">And that it did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.473" offset="3569246">Although it used no words to that effect and although we submit a fair reading of the legislative history shows that it had no such intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.195" offset="3604146">Now, Congress knew how to provide for arbitration, how to provide for methods of compelling arbitration if it wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.681" offset="3646046">The 1925 Arbitration Act shows that it knew how to do it if it wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.919" offset="3667048">The amendments to the Railway Labor Act which this Court considered in its opinion of yesterday in the Brotherhood case showed that Congress knew how to do it when it wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.627" offset="3705919">In that Act, for example, with respect to minor disputes it set up a procedure under which both parties had to go to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.245" offset="3744371">When it came to major disputes on the other hand, it was very careful to say that this shall remain voluntary and neither party is obligated to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.422" offset="3777076">It knew how to deal with an arbitration question if it wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.310" offset="3796616">So, we come then to the provisions of the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.908" offset="3818977">And do they change the situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="932.341" offset="3832769">Now, you certainly don't find anything in the language of the Act that suggests, in anyway, that Congress was now for the first time deciding as a matter of policy that arbitration under labor agreements should be enforced when it had decided in 1925 that they should not be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.401" offset="3913017">What is the language?</text>
            <text syncTime="955.942" offset="3927124">Suits for violation of contract between an employer and the labor organization may be brought in any District Court of the United States without regard to the amount in controversy or diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.919" offset="3986996">Does that sound in anyway like a policy declaration that arbitration agreement should be enforceable and that the federal court should have the power to enforce it?</text>
            <text syncTime="981.397" offset="4029001">It certainly does.Now, they sought to draw out -- to draw out of a few phrases in the Senate report a contrary -- a contrary policy to that Congress had adopted before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.954" offset="4107160">Mr. Feller said that the purpose -- the purpose of 301 was to create a substantive right to the enforcement, collective-bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.755" offset="4158360">And then that necessarily embraced a substantive right to the enforcement of arbitration clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.129" offset="4191901">I think the fair reading of the majority report and the minority report shows clearly that there was no such intention on the part of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.800" offset="4242578">What was Congress faced with in conjunction with section 301?</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.755" offset="4266402">It was faced with the -- as the reports say again and again, it was faced with the procedural difficulties of employers suing unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.595" offset="4305795">There was no procedural difficulty to unions suing employers that's been sued time and time again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.208" offset="4336201">It was not faced with the lack of any substantive right to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.422" offset="4365040">Employers had been sued on collective-bargaining agreements long prior to the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.795" offset="4394506">And employers had sued unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.757" offset="4406418">The minority report of the Senate and the House both referred to a case as one example of it in 265 F.397, where an employer sued a union for breach of a no-strike clause and recovered a 1920 case, a suit brought on the basis of diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.215" offset="4484263">There's no doubt that there was a contract which was enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.433" offset="4505057">The difficulty was purely procedural.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.205" offset="4516237">Now, Congress -- how did Congress go about correcting that difficulty?</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.592" offset="4541733">But it did -- it could not, of course, make the State change their methods of procedure with respect to suing an unincorporated association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.891" offset="4582902">So, it said the remedy is to make a labor union an entity for purposes of suit in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.314" offset="4616652">And they did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.134" offset="4631907">They -- and that's all they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.998" offset="4651342">What they wanted to do was to bring the union up to the level of the employer with respect to suability so far as procedure went and not so far as substance went because they didn't have to create a substantive right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.197" offset="4708185">And as the committee reports point out, there is no doubt that under state law collective agreements are enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.956" offset="4743189">They are state contracts and they're governed by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.058" offset="4759594">Indeed, if Congress had wanted to create a substantive federal right to enforcement of a collective-bargaining agreement in the very language of section 301 in Congress was such a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.125" offset="4815914">If what Congress was doing was saying a collective-bargaining agreement is a valid and enforceable and binding contract, and the mind of the statute doesn't say that, that's just one phrase in the Senate majority report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.939" offset="4867114">If they have done that, why provide in section 301 without regard to the citizenship of the party?</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.302" offset="4896580">Because if you have created a federal substantive right, then you don't need diversity jurisdiction to get into the federal court, you come into the federal court on the basis that this is a cause of action arising under the laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.133" offset="4955930">The very fact of what they chose to remove was the diversity requirement shows that they were not intending to create a substantive federal right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1743.025" offset="7075506">Professor Howard wrote a long article in the January 1956 Missouri Law Review presiding Missouri's consideration of the necessity for such legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.709" offset="7134229">He refers and the Bar Association refers to the reports of the Governor of Pennsylvania's Committee which studied the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.589" offset="7173726">And the conclusion saying that the, first, that if the rare case that gets to arbitration at all, by and large most problems are worked out in the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.479" offset="7225240">But when you get to arbitration it maybe in 1% or 2% of the cases that you have a refusal to go to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.279" offset="7264528">And that refusal as exemplified in these cases isn't just the casual some of you know that the arbitration clause has been saying we don't want to enforce them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.696" offset="7310190">We don't want it to be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.876" offset="7314892">The reason for it is the parties had a dispute as to whether the particular grievance is or is not covered by the arbitration clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.396" offset="7360972">Employers don't and can't likely say, no we don't like arbitration clauses and we won't -- we won't abide by them when -- when the situation comes that we -- well, we're bothered by it, we'll just disregard it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.949" offset="7423143">And there's a built-in protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.819" offset="7434637">Unions have given no-strike clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.914" offset="7442996">Mr. Feller says in return to some extent for arbitration clauses, the employer willfully and callously refuses to obey the arbitration clause that the union has clearly resolved from its no-strike clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.505" offset="7501406">There's no -- no incentive for anyone to be arbitrated willful about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.345" offset="7520737">But the occasions do arise when both parties have a difference of opinion as to whether or not an issue is arbitrable and then you may have a disagreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.785" offset="7558562">And there's the -- the -- well there are no precise statistics on it, students of the problem said it's about in 1% or 2% of the cases that that occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.235" offset="7600358">Now, is the need great?</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.804" offset="7614568">Because agreements to arbitrate on -- in labor contracts are not specifically enforceable, is that harmful?</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.293" offset="7648528">Well, the statistics cited by Judge Brown in his dissenting opinion in the Lincoln Mills case show that agreements -- the percentage of labor contract which have agreements to arbitrate in them increased from 73% in 1944 to 91% in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.677" offset="7734105">And during that period were -- were arbitration clauses enforceable?</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.725" offset="7754271">They certainly weren't enforceable in the federal court, not until 1950 that any federal court suggest that the Arbitration Act applied not until Judge Wyzanski's opinion in the American Thread case in 1953 were there are many cases if the -- any other cases which held that this kind of agreement could be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.615" offset="7845804">They weren't -- were they enforceable in the state courts?</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.085" offset="7855731">In some States and a few States but in other States not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.803" offset="7870568">But without machinery for enforcement, what happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.863" offset="7886869">Labor unions increasingly adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.912" offset="7898990">And they adopted them because -- an employer did because by -- by and large you don't need judicial compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.342" offset="7936711">The same students of the problem who say -- who point out the lack of necessity for judicial compulsion, point out that labor and many others well-versed in the field feel that the intrusion of the judicial process itself may in the long run destroy the voluntary nature of arbitration and do more harm than good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.603" offset="8045798">The philosophy of the Taft-Hartley Act is that if you get people to sit down across the table and talk to each other, they can usually work out their grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.863" offset="8094804">Now, they do work out their grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.413" offset="8101073">You get to up -- if they don't work them out in arbitration -- in the grievance procedure, you get up to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.123" offset="8127822">Union may say we think this is arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.063" offset="8135659">The company says we don't think it's arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.053" offset="8147571">In most instances there is an accommodation of one party to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.862" offset="8170872">The union will say, well, maybe you're right in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.322" offset="8184665">We won't fret if you won't go to arbitration or the company says, well, in this case we -- while we don't think it's arbitrable, it's not going to set a great precedence then we'll go to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.572" offset="8225625">So, in most instances it's worked -- it's worked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.782" offset="8238477">But to introduce into the picture the right of either party to go to court and what happened?</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.074" offset="8267630">I think what happened is illustrated by the fact that since the opinion in -- in American Thread in 1953, there's been a flood, a rush of cases involving arbitration agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.175" offset="8324054">There weren't any before obviously the parties were not dissatisfied with the situation before because more and more of them adopted the arbitration agreement in their labor contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.485" offset="8365328">So that once you introduced the (Inaudible) then you've changed the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.210" offset="8388211">It encourages the union to push as far as it can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.201" offset="8416214">After all a union business agent owe some obligation to his fellow unionist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.675" offset="8446098">Everybody wants him to play, and head far and to go as far as you can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.560" offset="8461563">So, you carry it for the grievance procedure and then you take it to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.040" offset="8479535">And if, however, the company refuses arbitration then you can't go any further, all right, you go further.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.010" offset="8503463">You then carry it to court whereas to have -- without that you'd have to stop and the company said no, similarly the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.165" offset="8536064">Company takes the position that the grievance is not arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.105" offset="8555813">Usually you -- they can work it out with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.780" offset="8566471">But if they get to court that's going to decide the question, all right, let's go to court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2149.168" offset="8700008">In that case after the decision of the Court of Appeals, the question came up before the District Court as to whether the matter was arbitrable or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2160.901" offset="8746924">The union appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.611" offset="8753821">The union lawyer was saying, “Well, look we -- we really don't think we're going to win on this.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.480" offset="8769285">And they didn't because the First Circuit affirmed Judge Sweeney.</text>

            <text syncTime="3018.403" offset="12177011">You've got to look at the basic controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.813" offset="12190595">Now, obviously, if for example, you have a commercial arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.043" offset="12219538">The seller agrees to sell some potatoes and the buyer says they're bad potatoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.389" offset="12240959">And the seller wants to enforce an arbitration clause in the sales agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.629" offset="12261857">Where did he go to enforce it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.859" offset="12270843">Section 4 tells you where he goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.200" offset="12280142">He goes to the Court which, had there been no arbitration clause, would have had jurisdiction over this controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.740" offset="12306369">What's this controversy?</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.880" offset="12310862">This controversy is whether there's a breach of the sales agreement or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3068.367" offset="12376795">The Act then said the judicial code, not title 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.762" offset="12386408">And what's the basis?</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.032" offset="12391528">Diversity of citizenship or it's a case arising under the laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.812" offset="12418591">And we submit that the Court -- the District Court in this case didn't have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.599" offset="12437817">But even if you adopt Judge Magruder's view and you say well, it's enough that this jurisdiction under 301, the basic controversy in this case is one over which the District Court had no jurisdiction under 301 because the basic controversy is whether Mr. Boiardi was being paid too little and Mr. Armstrong was improperly fired.</text>

            <text syncTime="3106.165" offset="12527992">I'll put it to you that you're up against the Gully.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.755" offset="12542412">I mean an adjudication on the point you're making on that analysis brings you right up to the Gully case the mere fact that ultimately you may reach a federal statute doesn't mean the case arises under it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_f_farr" startTime="3121.588" stopTime="3457.822">
            <label>Mr. Warren F. Farr</label>
            <text syncTime="3121.588" offset="12589746">Yes, I -- I think the Gully case entirely supports my position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.028" offset="12607509">It's simply because you have a question as to a -- a violation of the collective-bargaining agreement, you don't have a case arising under the laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.468" offset="12641259">Because to arise under the laws of the United States, what has got to be involved is the construction or application of a statute which will determine the plaintiff's case one or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.238" offset="12676368">Now, there's no statute in the United States which will determine one way or the other whether Mr. Boiardi gets paid more or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.668" offset="12702072">So, I submit the Court has no jurisdiction under section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.398" offset="12717014">Now, finally, the Norris-LaGuardia Mr. Goldberg told Your Honors yesterday that every Court of Appeals which had considered the application of the Norris-LaGuardia Act to a case like this was against it (Inaudible) against our position on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.284" offset="12792560">And so on accounting of (Inaudible) we're entirely wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.864" offset="12810846">But every Court of Appeals which has considered the problem has I think done it in a very summary fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.117" offset="12843865">The Lincoln Mills case certainly did and the Seventh Circuit recently did and I don't believe with the exception of the court below, I don't believe anyone has ever really seriously considered the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.186" offset="12888168">Now, our point with respect to the Norris-LaGuardia Act is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.734" offset="12910320">Here is a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.219" offset="12920247">There's no doubt about that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.489" offset="12929337">Controversy involving services, conditions of employment and the Court of Appeals said the Norris-LaGuardia Act, as everybody admits, is still in existence notwithstanding, Taft-Hartley.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.814" offset="12978657">Therefore, it applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.134" offset="12987956">Now, what does the Norris-LaGuardia Act say?</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.789" offset="13002480">Section 7 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act says, "No court shall have jurisdiction to issue a temporary or permanent injunction in any case involving a growing out of a labor dispute except if certain conditions are met."</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.551" offset="13069563">Certain allegations made, certain findings made by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.601" offset="13085759">Those allegations were not made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.771" offset="13094431">Those findings weren't made and we say section 7 therefore is clearly barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.772" offset="13118464">Now, in the first place, appellate argues to you that section 7 merely qualifies for section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.548" offset="13161514">Section 4 sets out a number of instances in which the Court under no circumstances can ever grant an injunction in the case involving a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.524" offset="13209475">You can't enjoin anyone from striking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.694" offset="13218147">You can't enjoin them for becoming a member of another union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.824" offset="13230686">And he says that all section 7 does is to qualify the one or two instances in section 4 where an injunction may be granted if the means are unlawful or -- or there's coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.298" offset="13280528">I submit that section 7 is intended to go further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.198" offset="13296201">The purpose of the Norris-LaGuardia Act was to take the Court out of the business of dealing with labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.668" offset="13326085">Maybe Congress went too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.488" offset="13337370">If you remember that at the time it was enacted labor and others were seriously concerned that the federal courts were getting too mixed up in the labor field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.019" offset="13379480">So that Congress decided to take them out entirely except -- except to have a case of unlawfulness or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.339" offset="13416678">Then they may come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.453" offset="13425142">In every other instance they're out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.663" offset="13434023">Now, says the court below well that's -- if you've got to make the allegation from the finding of section 7 requirements then those findings would be totally in apposite here and therefore you don't have to make it, because they don't have any relation to the enforcement of an agreement to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.653" offset="13513958">That assumes it seems to me that assumes that Congress intended that the Court should have jurisdiction in this kind of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.833" offset="13554709">The fact that you can't come within the exception to a statute doesn't mean that the -- the exception is to be disregarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.632" offset="13589922">And it seems to me that's exactly what the court below has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.382" offset="13604864">It has sought to evade and get out of the plain words of section 7 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act and we submit that the Act was (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.073" offset="13643630">We submit that the way -- what the court below has done is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.313" offset="13668603">It twisted and turned its way in order to reach a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.773" offset="13690441">It construed contracts of employment one way in section 1 of the Act and agreements evidencing a transaction in interstate commerce in another way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.500" offset="13741328">Using a rigid construction here and a broad construction there, reads out certain provisions of section 7 to reach a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.010" offset="13771421">What's the result?</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.260" offset="13776436">In order to compel enforcement of arbitration provisions in labor agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.200" offset="13800155">Now, I submit that there is no such clear policy that any such tortuous course is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.650" offset="13829935">That if there is to be such a policy, the policy for Congress to make, it can make it and when it has there, then there's no question but that the -- the Court can tolerate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.585" offset="13877687">But that -- but that the Court should not make it and that it set off on an unchartered sea which Congress itself has said was not to be embarked upon in related matters.</text>
