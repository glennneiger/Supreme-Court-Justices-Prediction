            <text syncTime="5.664" offset="125994">If it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.443" offset="137174">We were just before the recess discussing the question of this Court's jurisdiction to hear this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.261" offset="172387">We have presented certain matters to the Court, which I believe clearly indicates that this Court does not have jurisdiction to consider the sole question which is raised here.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.762" offset="230379">I would like to merely bring out one or two other points.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.954" offset="255143">Perhaps, they are repetitious and so, they are deserving of emphasis.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.760" offset="274369">First of all, this hearing, which has been referred to as a hearing is not a -- in fact, a hearing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.399" offset="308955">It is described as an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.288" offset="320554">Purpose of that investigation is not merely to find out if somebody is guilty of a crime and then charge him with arson but it is to find out certain other facts, because of the fire as to whether or not it was in incendiary in nature or the result of carelessness and perhaps other matters which come within the province of the State Fire Marshal of the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.220" offset="432253">Secondly, there is one point which I would like to bring out at this time, and that is that we have stayed away in this case from the question of the enforcement here.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.766" offset="490454">We did not want to bring in collateral matters which we felt had -- would only more or less clutter up the case, but the Court's attention should be directed to the fact that although, Section 3737.99 provides a more or less summary commitment, there is an alternative procedure which could be followed here, and that is Ohio Revised Code Section 29 -- 27 -- 2917.26 is a general section which makes it a misdemeanor to commit contempt by refusing to obey the subpoena of or to refuse to answer questions or refuse to be sworn of a Court or other legal authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.082" offset="727751">Other term or other legal authority there would cover of course the many state departments, administrative departments which do have the power to subpoena and examine witness before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.540" offset="777488">So that -- that section also provides that that would be handled in the usual manner of going in before a Court and having that contempt charge would be an open hearing and that would of course, do away completely with any application of the Oliver and Murchison cases here.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.219" offset="868289">So that --</text>

            <text syncTime="2613.986" offset="10559300">“Examination of witnesses before arrest after a felony has been committed and before any arrest has been made, the prosecuting attorney of the county or any judge or magistrate may cause subpoena to issue, returnable before any court or magistrate for any person to give information concerning such felony.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2644.349" offset="10680717">Before such witnesses required to give any information, he must be informed of the purpose of the inquiry and that he is required to tell the truth concerning the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.845" offset="10734738">He shall then be sworn and be examined under oath by the prosecuting attorney or the Court or magistrate, subject to the penalties for perjury under Section of the Code and subject to the constitutional right of the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.924" offset="10815091">Such examination shall be taken in writing, in any form and shall be filed with the Court or magistrate taking the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.309" offset="10864619">Here, we were confronted in this case now by saying "Come in.</text>

            <text syncTime="2717.418" offset="10973080">We said “No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.593" offset="10985723">We went to the Attorney General's Office, whom we are on very friendly relationship and on an honorable basis and said to them, “We don't think that's the law, although your former predecessor has said it was.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.231" offset="11064299">He said, "Well, we will be glad to cooperate with you and have it questioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="2747.503" offset="11093347">He agreed with us that we should go to the Supreme Court and we did went to the Chief Justice Weygandt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.433" offset="11125112">And they said they would hear us one week, just take a week time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.755" offset="11138382">We said, “We have no question of delay here.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.346" offset="11148727">Now, remember, this is in -- in a small community and these things have bearings upon people's business and upon their standing in the community.</text>

            <text syncTime="2783.377" offset="11236916">So, we said we will go to the Supreme Court to save time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2798.284" offset="11296475">It was not our purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.827" offset="11306715">If you will let my son and I as counsel for these men, we will come in and we will try to answer any question that you want to ask us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.303" offset="11352586">We will give you any record that we think you're entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.966" offset="11367215">He said, "No.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.590" offset="11369723">You're not coming in."</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.102" offset="11375783">The Attorney General said, "Well, look, let's get it decided.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.255" offset="11392397">Said, “You get your petition all ready.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.444" offset="11401174">You come over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.570" offset="11405667">You'll have to have it, show that, though there have to be a commitment because we just couldn't go into court and get a declaratory judgment on this case."</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.690" offset="11438164">So, with that gentleman's agreement with the Fire Marshal concurring, we appear before the Fire Marshal at 1:30 in the afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.166" offset="11492080">The Fire Marshal informs me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.150" offset="11500022">He said, "I'm not allowed to come in."</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.560" offset="11505664">I said, "I understand that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.991" offset="11511306">I appreciate that."</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.570" offset="11517680">I said, “My clients are not going to testify.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.562" offset="11529592">They went in, came back out, refusing to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.325" offset="11548714">He comes out and he says, "Come on, you're going to jail."</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.195" offset="11564178">And I said, "Well, wait a minute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.463" offset="11569194">We have an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.661" offset="11574000">We're going to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.163" offset="11580061">You're not to put these men in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.754" offset="11586435">You're just to commit them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.270" offset="11592495">"Oh, no."</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.505" offset="11597406">He said, "No, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.493" offset="11601377">We're taking them down to jail."</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.622" offset="11605870">So, they're defying my rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.505" offset="11613393">I've got rights here and I'm going to see that they testify and they're going to obey me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.615" offset="11633873">He takes them down on the elevator, takes them down to the Sheriff's Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.512" offset="11665429">The Attorney General was dumbfounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.046" offset="11675564">Certainly, it was not in keeping with our understanding that he -- he was shocked about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.500" offset="11693328">Now, no one, but these prosecutors were gentlemen at all times so was the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.643" offset="11717987">They took him down and the Sheriff was kind enough to let him sit down in the outer office and that's where they remained until we got one of the Common Pleas judges to grant the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.635" offset="11765948">Now, that's what -- that is the actual facts as to how these things come up in our hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.276" offset="11796459">So then, when we went in to the Common Pleas Court, we told the Common Pleas Court, "We raise the question that they have -- that they did have a right to counsel in this kind of a hearing before this officer that had this power -- amended powers under the statutes."</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.175" offset="11872110">Because when we're going to make the decision under those cases.</text>
