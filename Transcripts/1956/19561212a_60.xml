            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 60, Robert W. Jaffke versus William C. Dunham, Trustee.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herbert J. Miller, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="12.623" offset="153893">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.965" offset="163192">This is a petition for reclamation filed by one, Jaffke, who is the petitioner here, against William Dunham, who was the trustee in bankruptcy of the estate of Robert Knetzer, who has since died.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.024" offset="231424">The two principal issues in this case are, first, a question of appellate procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.441" offset="257128">The question whether the Court of Appeals had the right to refuse to pass on questions urged by the Appellee, the petitioner here, who was victorious in the trial court, in the absence of a cross-appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.553" offset="333615">The second principal issue, presented by this case, is whether the trustee in bankruptcy, the responded here, had a duty to investigate the source of payments made to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.020" offset="395473">Under a turnover order, these payments being made on -- and the time period running up to three and half years after the bankrupt was adjudicated at such.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.310" offset="464645">The bankrupt in this case, Robert Knetzer, had, prior to 1948, engaged in a fraudulent scheme of defrauding people of money which they had deposited on automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.832" offset="534653">In 1948, he was adjudged a bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.489" offset="557328">In July of 1949, approximately nine months after his adjudication, the respondent trustee filed a petition asking the bankruptcy court to enter a turnover order.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.126" offset="619917">This, the Court did in July of 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.941" offset="639143">Compliance with the turnover order, not being forthcoming, the bankrupt was the adjudged in contempt of court on December 1st, 1949, and it was sentenced to be incarcerated as a civil contempt order.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.235" offset="712286">This was stayed -- the sentence to jail was paid, however, until March of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.205" offset="748231">Subsequent at this date, he was placed in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.231" offset="772263">However, subsequent to March of 1950, on many occasions, the bankrupt was release from custody, ostensibly to obtain assets with which to comply with the turnover order which required him to pay to the trustee in bankruptcy, the sum of $250,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.283" offset="852511">While on these excursions from custody, the bankrupt contacted Jaffke, the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.732" offset="890337">And by reasons of certain fraudulent representation to him, concerning a large scale building development which was to be run by the Bison Corporation, a fictitious organization, Knetzer defrauded Jaffke of the sum of $47,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.219" offset="968286">This occurred in a period commencing in December of 1950, approximately a year and a half after the entry of the turnover order and payments were made by Jaffke to Knetzer through October of 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.161" offset="1051982">After this money had been obtained from Jaffke, he subsequently discovered that he had been the defrauded.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.053" offset="1095555">And he approached the bankrupt and attempted to ascertain what had become of his asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.608" offset="1137768">Pursuant to this conversation, the bankrupt executed an affidavit, which in effect states, that he had borrowed $47,000 from Jaffke and that he had paid $36,000 of Jaffke's money over to the trustee in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.037" offset="1243512">Subsequently, Jaffke filed his petition for reclamation in the bankruptcy court.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.049" offset="1267545">He named as the defendant, the bankrupt, Robert Knetzer, suing him for $47,000 and he also named as the defendant trustee of Knetzer's estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.954" offset="1323238">Well, prior to trial, however, Knetzer died and the case proceeded with only the respondent trustee as the defendant in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.781" offset="1370467">At the trial, it appeared that the -- the fraudulent representations of the bankrupt to Jaffke was set out in full, and demonstrated that Jaffke had gone out on the basis of these representations and had borrowed money from other people which he subsequently repaid in order to invest in this scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.766" offset="1462418">The trial court found that the -- Knetzer had committed a fraud on Jaffke and the appellate court affirmed that finding of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.309" offset="1508603">Therefore, I shall not detail all of those facts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.015" offset="1527411">At the trial, it appeared, further, that the trustee in bankruptcy had, on several occasions, been approached by Knetzer while he was a civil contemnor at a time from one to two years subsequent to the time when he had been adjudged to -- a civil contemnor for failure to comply with his turnover order.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.584" offset="1633677">And pursuant to Knetzer's request, the trustee would call his attorney or would call the bankruptcy judge who sentenced Knetzer to jail and would ask that Knetzer have additional time free from incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.658" offset="1709955">This was done on representations by Knetzer to his trustee in bankruptcy that he would obtain additional assets so as to comply with the turnover order.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.411" offset="1761050">Now, the evidence also discloses that there were small payments running over a period, starting in approximately September of 1950 and continuing on until February of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.292" offset="1844537">These payments ran from $1000, $5000 or $10,000 bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.407" offset="1896991">And at no time did the trustee have any evidence as to whether or not these payments constituted to conceal assets of the bankrupt's estate, he so testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.000" offset="1971388">He further testified that at no time did he make any inquiry of the bankrupt as to where these assets had been obtained, and this was true, even though the payments were made in 1950, 1951, and 1952, the bankrupt had been adjudicated as such in 1948 and the -- the turnover order or $250,000 had been entered in the middle of 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.725" offset="2122271">It further appeared, in addition to this, that third parties had come in to the trustee in bankruptcy, and said, I will be responsible or so much a week, in once instance, I will be responsible for $1000 a day under Knetzer's turnover order.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.101" offset="2199803">Now, a desired position here, of course, that all of these facts taken together placed the trustee on notice and required him to inquire as to where Knetzer was obtaining these funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.738" offset="2262288">The trial court found for petitioner, Jaffke, the petitioner here, entered a judgment in a sum of $27,400.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.539" offset="2313488">The trial court specifically found that Jaffke had been defrauded by Knetzer, it specifically found that $27,400 of Jaffke's money had been paid in to the trustee in bankruptcy in purported compliance with his turnover order and that the trustee in bankruptcy had no right to these assets because they were after acquired property and were in fact the property of Jaffke.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.376" offset="2444831">The Court also found that the equities of the case were with the petitioner Jaffke.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.956" offset="2479208">However, at the trial, there was admitted in the evidence the affidavit signed by the bankrupt admitting that he had turned $36,000 of Jaffke's money over to the trustee in bankruptcy to buy further freedom from jail so that he could make installment payments to the trustee and gain a little more time out of jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.013" offset="2603447">While this affidavit was admitted at the trial, nevertheless, the trial court, after finding for petitioner, struck the affidavit from evidence, no reason was given for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.212" offset="2656214">The respondent trustee appealed at the Court of Appeals and his main point before that Court was that there was no evidence to demonstrate that Jaffke's money had in fact been turned over to the trustee in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.268" offset="2744404">The Court of Appeals passed on several other points raised by the appellant's trustee in bankruptcy and then stated, but because no cross-appeal has been filed by the appellee, Jaffke, in this case, we cannot consider the evidence which was stricken by the trial court, namely, this affidavit, and consequently, there is no evidence in the record to demonstrate that Knetzer did in fact turned Jaffke's money over to the trustee in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.617" offset="2909811">Now, I would like to emphasize again that Knetzer had died prior to the trial of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.214" offset="2944188">Consequently, the Court reversed the judgment of the trial court and instead of remanding the case for further proceedings, entered judgment for the appellant, the trustee in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.296" offset="3028511">Now, there is no question, I think, under the decisions of this Court, under the decisions of other courts that the appellee in -- in an appellate tribunal has the right to urge in support of his judgment in the District Court, any matter that was urged in the trial court, the cases are clear on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.511" offset="3137390">In fact, I would like to point out to this Court that the trustee, the respondent here has urged before this Court an argument which it made to the appellate court but it did not file a cross-petition for certiorari.I</text>
            <text syncTime="775.878" offset="3206875">ndeed, it would not have standing to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.669" offset="3218056">He was a victorious party in the Court of Appeals and that is another reason why the petitioner here, Jaffke, could not have filed a cross-appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.191" offset="3268106">He was the victorious party.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.155" offset="3275943">He had a judgment in his favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.274" offset="3284511">The findings of fact were all in his favor.</text>

            <text syncTime="804.999" offset="3323382">The difference in that that, Your Honor, is this, $3800 -- when Knetzer first approached Jaffke in December of 1950, he specifically told Jaffke that $3800 of this money had to be paid into court or would be paid into court under the provisions of a turnover order which he, and Knetzer had signed under duress.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.731" offset="3454307">On the second $4800 with the last payments that Knetzer had given to Jaffke when Jaffke finally getting suspicious, demanded an automobile as a mortgage or as a channel mortgage to secure that payment and that was subsequently repaid to Jaffke in this case by -- by relevant of Knetzer.</text>

            <text syncTime="877.855" offset="3614804">Now, to be sure, we could have appealed from the failure of the trial court to award us the full amount claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.385" offset="3652942">However, in the past year that the case was, we really, in effect, were not agreeing by the one part of the trial court's order which we wanted to appeal from but couldn't, i.e., describing of a -- of a document from evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1049.344" offset="4300779">So if we can ignore the fact that this is a -- an affidavit, although, really it is stronger than an oral statement or a written statement because it was signed under oath and at the time Knetzer signed it, there was an attorney with him who said you cannot sign that unless it is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.611" offset="4365772">But, in the affidavit, Knetzer does three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.992" offset="4379355">First of all, he admits that he owes Knetzer -- Jaffke $47,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.938" offset="4411120">Now, that certainly is a declaration against pecuniary interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.657" offset="4425958">The second thing he does, he admits that he turned $36,000 of petitioner's money over to the trustee in order to buy freedom from imprisonment as he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.249" offset="4484368">Now, that is also a declaration against interest because it demonstrates that he acted fraudulently with respect to the petitioner Jaffke in this case because Jaffke didn't give him $36,000 to pay over to the trustee in bankruptcy, he gave him $36,000 to be used in the development of a housing transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.191" offset="4588126">But, even more important on this -- on this declaration against interest point is that Knetzer, by admitting the $36,000 of Jaffke's money had been paid over to trustee was in effect wiping out $36,000 of the amount that he, Jaffke, that -- that he, Knetzer, had paid in under the turnover order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.878" offset="4698885">Consequently, if you took that $36,000 away, then his only prospect was further imprisonment as a civil contemnor for failure to comply with the turnover order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.427" offset="4757086">Consequently, I -- I can't see any basis for excluding this declaration against interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1541.336" offset="6268740">The next period, from December of 1950 until October of 1951, the trustee received approximately $75,000 under this turnover order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1575.758" offset="6406353">And then subsequent to that date, one, Sammons would have testified had he been at the trail and was stipulated that from November, and I emphasize from November 1st, 1951, to February of 1952, that he had paid $102,000 to Knetzer, again, on one of his fraudulent experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.904" offset="6506977">Now, the only -- the court -- that was that was one of the things that where the Court of Appeals erred because they included in this period, Sammons, $102,000 when it clearly appears and the counsel here I believe has admitted it because on page 4 of this brief, he said that the period run from November of 1952 through -- November of 1951 through December of 1952 for Sammons' money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.179" offset="6624110">And that is beyond the period herein question.So consequently, we contend that we have demonstrated that that money must have come form Jaffke.</text>

            <text syncTime="1927.261" offset="7812368">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.189" offset="7828146">Briefly, we have before us here one of the tangents of another Ponzi case, this happened beginning in about 1944, 1945, and 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.180" offset="7876106">This bankrupt probably milked the public under several million dollars in a scheme on used cars whereby they deposited $1000 with him and -- and he sold them at less price, and bought them at about $1500 over less price, and we never could quite figure out how he expected to make a profit on that operation, but he got several million dollars and -- and deposits on cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.442" offset="7985089">And on every car that he delivered, he lost $1000 to $1500, $2000 because during this war period right after the war, he had to pay off these large sums of money in order to get cars to deliver to keep this fraud going.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.066" offset="8043604">No question but what we're dealing with a man who was a fraudulent operator from the very beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.161" offset="8075995">The claims in this matter originally were over $8 million and we started to untangle all of the affairs to show you the magnitude of it, I believe Judge Bechtle asked the bankrupt something about some books one time and -- wel,l he says, Your Honor, the money was just coming in and so fast that we couldn't keep track of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.051" offset="8147571">And as it came in one drawer and went out another, it -- it has been a terrible headache to try and unwind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.862" offset="8182784">We originally had two bankruptcies; a corporate bankrupt and an individual bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.766" offset="8202428">Those were later consolidated and are now being administered on the one bank -- bankruptcy only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.039" offset="8231476">Now, some of the things that the record show in this case may have a bearing upon this matter of constructive trust and that is the conduct of the petitioner himself in this particular proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.059" offset="8291558">He lost $11,300 in the first fraudulent operations of this bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.746" offset="8322382">He made deposits on tractors that he expected to sell and make a profit on, and so he lost $11,300 when that goes on, and he tried to get that money back, he hired attorneys and couldn't get his money back after bankruptcy, and he filed a claim in the bankruptcy proceeding which is still pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.581" offset="8413706">Now, this turnover order that was issued by Judge Bechtle was based upon evidence that was presented in open court, we had an auditor, and Judge Bechtle found that he had the sum of at least $250,000 in his possession or under his control and that he should pay that sum of money to his trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.089" offset="8519764">That order became final.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.629" offset="8525928">There was no appeal from that order and he never did attempt to purge himself from contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.810" offset="8554663">Now, under the holding of this Court, I realized we can't keep a bankrupt in jail forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.561" offset="8581622">In the (Inaudible) case, this Court held that if a bankrupt can show that he doesn't have the ability to comply with a turnover order or he can come in and getting himself purged of contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.903" offset="8626970">This man did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.092" offset="8635747">So therefore, the presumption goes on that he could have complied with this turnover order or else he would have been purged of contempt under the remedies of law available to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.540" offset="8681514">So, the trustee in this case was faced by an order of court that he was to collect $250,000 from his bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.556" offset="8721638">When he didn't pay, we had him cited for contempt and he was then incarcerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.911" offset="8747029">Judge Bechtle I think and there's been a lot of talk in these briefs about the duties of a trustee and some implication about Judge Bechtle and about the trustee as to whether rather they fulfill their duties properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.580" offset="8805648">To me, the integrity of the gentleman involved in this case is more important than the judgment in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.022" offset="8835427">Because he was trying to collect money from this man in order to pay the creditors in this bankrupt state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.572" offset="8869700">Now, the time and the brief's here, which is limited and shows that we've got $79,000 from the bankrupt although we did get a total of $170, 000 from the bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.310" offset="8932603">And there's no question about what the bankrupt got a lot of money from different people after bankruptcy, either borrowed it or they invested in this corporation or some deal that he had and there's no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.288" offset="9012537">Now, the petition in this matter here -- instantly, I might add in connection about the other that of course why these people put that money in this after bankruptcy is a matter of conjecture and matter of inferences to be drawn from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.609" offset="9085785">Well, I think, where the big million dollar, multimillion dollar operation like this but everyone felt that this man had money buried and they've won the bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.035" offset="9123506">It was all one round up, of course, maybe they were investing in these hidden answers I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.499" offset="9153390">Now, the petition in this matter claim $47,980 from the bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.547" offset="9177527">But as $36,000 from the trustee and the Court only allowed $27,400.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.290" offset="9208560">I would point out to this Court that this man Jaffke testified and admitted that he brought to bankrupts wind up everyday or so to see him in jail or every week.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.520" offset="9265403">They were quite friendly and by the way, the bankrupt was convicted as the records shows up concealing assets from his trustee in February of 1953, before he died.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.496" offset="9325380">So that, I thin that adds more emphasis to the fact that he had that money under his jurisdiction and control, but naturally, he couldn't walk into the trustee and say here's $5000 that I dug up from (Inaudible) in the backyard because immediately, he would have pled guilty to concealment of assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.325" offset="9404688">He therefore resorted to these devious methods of making it appear that other people were paying the money for him or that he was borrowing money so that he would not plead guilty to the concealment of assents.</text>

            <text syncTime="2456.927" offset="9931107">And this was man was tried for concealment of assets in 1953, now, after all of these had happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.738" offset="9958275">And this man, Jaffke, testified as a witness in the concealment case for the bankrupt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2485.534" offset="10045524">So, under those suspicious circumstances, I think we have a bearing or not a bearing upon the matter of constructive trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.309" offset="10084603">On that trial, he testified that he had loan the bankrupt of the sum of $47,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.277" offset="10120443">Now, as we go along and he gave this money to the bankrupt, and by the way, I believe, I don't think Mr. Miler intended to state that this corporation was fictitious because that is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.420" offset="10169031">It had a charter, it was chartered in the State of Montana, had bylaws in the -- the Mr. Jaffke knew the incorporator's world of the corporation and the record shows that he specifically asked the bankrupt why he was not an officer to corporation and the bankrupt says I can't be an officer because of this concealment of assets, business and the bankruptcy that I can't take any active part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.108" offset="10275819">And yet, the evidence of Jaffke was so conflicting in that connection, he first suddenly loan the money to Knetzer then he admitted he didn't give the money to buy stock in the corporation but that he invested the money in a corporate deal as he called it and he was to receive a share of the profits along with other men who invested money in the corporate deal based upon the percentage of the investments put in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.976" offset="10375293">And yet, they introduced -- accepts -- they took notes from the bankrupt and receipts as they went along which were absolutely contrary to the oral testimony of Jaffke.</text>

            <text syncTime="2728.613" offset="11017801">If you will look on -- on our brief on page 41 and 42, you will find there we've set up a chart, taken only from the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.787" offset="11066493">And I would like to point out that the petitioner here has included the document at page 192 and 193 of the record, which is merely a summation that he attached to his answer to a motion in the Circuit Court of Appeals and which is not taken from the evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.874" offset="11146846">Now, if the Court will notice, Jaffke paid on December 7th, 1950, $6100, to Knetzer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.041" offset="11191568">And let me point out that on that date, Knetzer told Jaffke that he needed the money to pay to the trustee on the turnover order, so that the petitioner in this case gave that money to Knetzer with the knowledge that it was to be used on the turnover order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.140" offset="11263979">And I send all the letter to all of the creditors in which I set forth all about this bankruptcy, about the turnover order, the fact that he had not paid anything on the turnover order and we were going to send him to jail and the petitioner admitted that he got one of those letters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.758" offset="11326360">He knew about the turnover order he was well apprised of all of that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.050" offset="11347571">Now, the only difference in the evidence, he says, he only gave him $3800 of that $6100 to apply on the turnover order, and the rest was on the corporate deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.679" offset="11398040">But on cross examination, I reminded him that I had taken his deposition and he admitted that the $6100 was on the turnover order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.626" offset="11417893">And he further on admitted on cross examination that that money was to be repaid to him in a few days by another individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.114" offset="11479855">Now, that certainly is inconsistent with his theory of any corporate deal because at the time I took his deposition, he admitted he expected to get that money back within a few days from another individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.616" offset="11525831">But I would like to point out, on page 41, December 7th, 13th, 18th, 21 and January 3rd, the total amount of money that was paid in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.797" offset="11594585">Now, if you will look on the next page at page 42, you will find that during the period of December 8th through December 22nd, the bankrupt paid to the trustee only the sum of $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.092" offset="11663757">And during the months of January, February and March after having received this money from Jaffke, the bankrupt paid nothing to the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.777" offset="11702523">But beginning on April 9th, 1951, he started paying further payments which more or less ties up with the next column on page 41 where a fellow with the name of Petty was furnishing some money purportedly to the bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.697" offset="11774203">Now, the Circuit Court of Appeal said that of the total amount paid out of $225,000 which the bankrupt got from these individuals, the trustee only got $79,000, of which is $145,000 not accounted for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.978" offset="11847241">Now, whose money was it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.261" offset="11860407">And the Court wound up by saying that there was no tracing whatsoever, there was no -- that it could be determined where the money came from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.681" offset="11898128">Now, my position is this, and I want to be frank in stating it, I -- I don't find any cases in the books on all course with this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.954" offset="11935222">We find cases on -- on constructive trust, on tracing and so on but we find absolutely no case where a trustee is faced with the matter of turnover order and then having these moneys paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.000" offset="11991333">As we turned over the principle that under Illinois law, in order to have a constructive trust, there must be fraud proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.968" offset="12023202">There must be certain elements such as falsity of statements and reliance upon those and then added to that, that demand acts in good faith, the person who is giving the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.321" offset="12080671">By my drawing analogy, I would say that if the bankrupt had gone to some widow woman and said give me $5000 and I'll go down and buy you some general motor stock with it and he instead took that money and paid it to the trustee and it could be proven that he paid that that money to the trustee that would be a constructive trust and we would have to give that money back for that woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.340" offset="12172727">Because at first, there is fraud, there is the circumstances under Illinois law which raised a constructive trust and when we get the money that's impressed with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.748" offset="12218389">But in these circumstances here with a man knowing that he has dealing with a fraudulent operator to begin with, knowing that he was under an order to turn the money over to the Court, he must have utter assurance that that money would be forthcoming some back to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.903" offset="12286934">Because he so testified that he could withdraw his money from Knetzer and demand it back any day which is contrary to his theory of investing it in a corporate deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.459" offset="12337194">And he said that's why it was put on those notes that it was to be repaid within six or eight day -- days so that he could always put his finger on it and call it back.</text>
