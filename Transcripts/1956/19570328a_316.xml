            <text syncTime="39.130" offset="259845">And therefore, I shall, with your permission, proceed to read the further findings which I believe to be pertinent.</text>

            <text syncTime="56.290" offset="328495">"That it is not true either as alleged in the complaint or otherwise that all or a majority or any of the board of directors and officers of Warner Brothers Pictures, Inc., wrongfully participated in the acts in the complaint complained of, nor was said board of directors dominated or controlled by Harry M. Warner, Jack L. Warner, Albert Warner, Milton Sperling or anyone or more of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.980" offset="455241">It is not true that if demand had been made upon the Warner Brothers Pictures, Inc., that those to whom such application would be made to institute such suit would have been disqualified from faithfully doing their duty as directors and officers of said corporation, because of any matters or facts set forth in said complaint, or otherwise, that no demand was made on the directors of said Warner Brothers Pictures, Inc., to institute this action and that such demand would have been futile, nor was any demand addressed to the stockholders of said corporation that the stockholders of the said corporation were not at the time of the execution of the contract complained of, or at any time, or at all, under the domination or control of the three brothers, Warner.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.626" offset="673834">Nor was said corporation at any time herein referred to in hands or under control, antagonistic to the financial interests of said corporation and its stockholders."</text>

            <text syncTime="211.454" offset="949164">Now, in connection with this matter of the demand would have been futile.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.848" offset="966719">Counsel has not given Your Honors the complete picture on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.411" offset="1000991">The record shows, and I believe that -- it's at record page 588, the so-called admissions in connection with the futility of the findings and I think that the examination of the record is important because the record is what we're interested in.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.174" offset="1104018">It appears at pages 587 and 586 in which the Court inquired of May, I should assume unless there is some contention expressly made to the contrary that this corporation would never have brought this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.433" offset="1189073">Is there any contention to the contrary?</text>
            <text syncTime="276.689" offset="1210180">And I say, we don't make such a contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.912" offset="1223032">Then, the Court -- I skip --</text>
            <text syncTime="281.851" offset="1230764">And the Court goes down to say, “So far as demand and refusal are concerned, I take it that the defendant in effect stipulates in such a -- that a demand would have been futile."</text>
            <text syncTime="292.216" offset="1272247">Mr. Williams, "but not for the reasons alleged in the complaint."</text>
            <text syncTime="295.497" offset="1285308">The Court, "No, but for the reasons contended by the defendant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="298.999" offset="1299414">Mr. Williams, “Certainly, not for the reason that the defendants ever contended that the contract was fraudulent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="306.911" offset="1330970">The Court, "As I understand, defendant's position and I can be corrected if I am in error, the defendant's position is that this was an advantageous arrangement for Warner -- for the Warner Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.176" offset="1396067">And the directors would have -- have upheld it at any time against any attack by any person including any group of stockholders."</text>
            <text syncTime="332.565" offset="1433684">Mr. Levy, “That is the position of both the individual defendants, Warner Brothers and the Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.133" offset="1455940">All of them contend likewise.”</text>
            <text syncTime="339.774" offset="1462418">Mr. Williams, “The individual defendants, Warner Brothers, are not involved in that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.426" offset="1485093">It is the corporation that is involved in that issue.”</text>
            <text syncTime="349.372" offset="1500871">The Court, “And for those reasons, no matter what demand the plaintiff stockholder had made on the directors, they would never have brought this suit, is that a fair statement of it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="359.229" offset="1540263">Mr. Williams, “Yes, that is a fair statement but not for the reasons alleged in the complaint that there was domination but for the reason and in the opinion of the responsible officers and directors of the corporation, this was a good contract.”</text>
            <text syncTime="375.449" offset="1605151">The Court, “By good, you mean advantageous to the corporation?”</text>
            <text syncTime="379.567" offset="1621661">Mr. Williams, “Advantageous to the Warner Corporation, yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="384.365" offset="1640782">Now, that is the so-called admission which was made and we regard it as a statement, rather than an admission, a statement of our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.759" offset="1690415">Now, the findings which I have taken the liberty of reading to this Court were considered and the evidence supporting those findings was considered by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the Court of Appeals found no reason to disturb the findings after the examination of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.575" offset="1785710">And so, stated at -- at page 5 of the Supplement Appendix 1 attached to the petition in this case where the opinion of the Court of Appeals is set forth in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.886" offset="1842866">I, therefore, take it that in this case, we are justified in taking the position that the questions which will be decided by this Court, the basic questions of law, will be decided on the assumption that the findings of this Court determined of -- of the lower court, determined the facts, the Court will not in view of the record in this case and the type and character of the petition for the writ of certiorari and the -- that was filed will not go back of the Court's findings, the Court of Appeals having found that the findings were supported by the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.531" offset="2029484">If I may narrow that, why I am -- I'm very seriously narrow because there has not been brought before this Court by any means, the -- the full evidence in the case, only a fragmentary portion of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.587" offset="2097716">Because we have assumed that in view of the opinion of the Court of Appeals that there would be no desire on the part of this Court to dig into the specific facts underlying the findings and -- and I am proceeding in my argument upon that theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.053" offset="2175561">Now, counsel has said that he does not question the sufficiency of the evidence to support the findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.431" offset="2229060">And on the other hand, he -- he -- at another point, he said in response to a question by one of the associate justices that he didn't think the evidence did support the findings and then at another point, he -- he went back to his original suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.290" offset="2316518">What he has attempted to do, I believe, is without making an -- a direct attack upon the sufficiency of the evidence to support the findings, he has taken certain fragmentary and disconnected evidentiary facts and talked about them without giving the full story in any particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.537" offset="2405543">And obviously, I cannot and do not believe I should.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.522" offset="2417455">At this time, endeavor can beyond the Court's findings and try to engage in discussion as to what the evidence has been omitted in his statement or what other evidence was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.209" offset="2468237">Now, we believe that the rule of law which has been established by this Court is as follows, we believe that this Court has stated that in a stockholder's derivative suit, the corporation will ordinarily and normally be aligned as a party plaintiff because it is the entity for whose benefit the action is being brought and the pursuit or entity which will recover the judgment if any.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.018" offset="2643466">It is the real party in address.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.454" offset="2657155">But, that there is an exception to that rule and that exception is a limited and special exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.772" offset="2682441">When the corporation is a captive corporation, when it is in hands antagonistic to its financial analysts, when it is unable by reason of that captivity and being in such antagonistic hands to properly represent itself, there is an exception and in that case, it will be aligned as a party defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.483" offset="2793305">We believe that is the true meaning of Doctor versus Harrington.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.659" offset="2810023">We believe that is the true meaning of Venner against the Great Northern and we respectfully submit to the Court that it is very tertiary and very well stated by this Court in the case of Koster against Lumbermens Mutual in which the Court epitomized the rule, as I understand it as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.712" offset="2906258">The cause of action which such a plaintiff, it is a stockholder, brings before the Court is not his own but the corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.878" offset="2946905">If it's the real party in interest and he is allowed to act in protection of its interests, somewhat as a next friend might do for an individual, because it is disabled from protecting itself, if however, such a case as this were treated in -- as other actions, the federal court would realign the parties for jurisdictional purposes according to their real interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.844" offset="3066755">In this case, which his typical of many, this would put Lumbermens on the plaintiff's side.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.608" offset="3097788">Illinois Corporations would then appear among plaintiffs and among defendants and jurisdiction would be ousted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2233.478" offset="9037302">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.416" offset="9057050">Perhaps to continue on the same line for a moment and bring into a little clearer focus what happened in this trial, I don't quite agree that in every instance, the issue of the merits is relevant to the issue of control or antagonism or to the issue of disability of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.302" offset="9144613">It so happened that in the instance given by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, it may not be relevant for the Court to inquire whether or not the promissory note was valid, whether or not the corporation owed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.432" offset="9205112">However, in this case, Judge Mathes, in an effort to lean over backwards and to accept every possible inquiry into the facts relevant to jurisdiction, listened to evidence not only as to the freedom of action of these directors, but also looked at the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.627" offset="9297899">Now, it is true and this is partially an answer to your inquiry, Mr. Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.212" offset="9320260">It is true that the contract might be circumstantial evidence that the directors were dominated or acted fraudulently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.269" offset="9364459">That is the relevance, only, the only relevance of the contract in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.199" offset="9384208">So, in the case of Mr. Justice Frankfurter's inquiry, it is possible that if a plaintiff comes in and says, “The corporation refuses to sue on $100,000 promissory note.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.510" offset="9425377">The evidence may be as follows, the directors may take the stand and say, “We don't think it's collectible.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.132" offset="9447946">They may say, “We don't think we have a good cause of action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.108" offset="9459754">Or they may say, “We have appraised this and in our opinion, the corporation would waste its money suing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.931" offset="9483055">Now whether or not -- whether or not the promissory note is valid would only be circumstantial evidence to show that the directors were or were not acting fraudulently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.228" offset="9524328">That is all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.410" offset="9529031">Now, in this case, Judge Mathes need not to have inquire into this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.137" offset="9547943">The fact of the matter is that he opened the door that we had an unlimited trial, that this case went 15 days or more, that this case involved a hundred and some exhibits that this contract was shown and the testimony of the executive vice president to be a contract from which Warner Brothers would derived over a $11 million in profits, that this contract were shown not to be an unusual transaction, but one of steady current of business transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2596.090" offset="10487724">This is strictly a case of federal jurisdiction, and the Court held a fair trial on federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.783" offset="10510503">And if anything, Mr. Justice Black, the Court went too far in my opinion in permitting everything into the record that could possibly touch upon the issue of domination or control or basically, disability.</text>

            <text syncTime="2773.702" offset="11198151">I want to add this by way of illuminating background to show how clearly this is a case strictly of federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.894" offset="11226990">This controversy started by suit in New York in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.653" offset="11246007">These are matters of judicial notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.433" offset="11253112">Immediately after that, there were piggyback bases, almost Chinese copies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.710" offset="11270248">There were 19 cases filed in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.897" offset="11282996">There were nine or ten of them in the state court, nine in the Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.538" offset="11297520">It was because of the bond rule and the case of Cohen versus Beneficial Loan that the plaintiff's attorneys in New York forwarded the cases to California and there were two, or three, or four or five, more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.668" offset="11342033">Now, some of the state courses in -- courts in New York are -- the cases are still pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.033" offset="11359483">This is no question whether plaintiff doesn't have a form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.780" offset="11370454">He's not barred by the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.176" offset="11380067">He is trying to elect the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.695" offset="11390203">He is trying to circumvent the rule of Doctor versus Harrington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.824" offset="11402637">The only issue here is that whether he has or hasn't the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.326" offset="11416639">We think he has it and we think that under California law, he'd be held not to have under the substantive law, but the fact to the matter is that the federal jurisdiction in this case has not been proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.746" offset="11470346">I -- I had some other things to say on this but I'm afraid I -- I have ran out.</text>

            <text syncTime="2914.792" offset="11762500">Now, on page 583 of the record, the Court says, "Do both sides rest on the issues as to jurisdiction latches or limitation?"</text>

            <text syncTime="3190.047" offset="12863509">In that case, the complainant stopped although a citizen of New Jersey had instituted a derivative suit in the New Jersey Court of Chancery, the defendant's name with his corporation, a New Jersey Company and the Pennsylvania Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.554" offset="12917635">The case had been removed from the state court to the federal District Court of New Jersey.</text>

            <text syncTime="3233.815" offset="13038634">The federal court should view the stockholder's corporation as a plaintiff and realign it with the complainant, thus bringing about diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.583" offset="13077713">The Court declines to do so and said on page 263, quote, "This contention has seem to necessitate before going to review of the authorities and Judge Lanning really made a review of the authorities."</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.068" offset="13131630">The rule deduced from them is that, in astute in equity instituted by a stockholder in his own name, but upon a right of action existing in his corporation, the stockholder's corporation will be aligned with the defendant's whenever the officers or persons controlling the corporation are shown to be opposed to the object sought by the complaining stockholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.649" offset="13245942">And that when such opposition does not appear, the stockholder's corporation will be aligned with the complainant in the suit, and this case was cited with approval in Venner against the Great Northern.</text>
