            <text syncTime="24.849" offset="202794">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.023" offset="215437">Now, this is an action for tort, the tort of conversion of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.676" offset="246053">The plaintiff is a national bank located in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.580" offset="273742">In May, 1944, it was the owner of a large number of bonds of the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, which it had acquired from its customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.872" offset="330898">These bonds had been called for redemption on May 1st, 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.125" offset="363917">And while they were in the plaintiff's premises, a few days after that, they -- they were stolen or at least they mysteriously disappeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.609" offset="417834">There's now, an interval of four years, more than four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.622" offset="449912">We next hear of the bonds in early September, 1948, when one Rocco, began a series of transactions with Parnell, who was a lawyer in the town of Indiana, Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.609" offset="529847">Now, although this town of Indiana, all of the events in this case, subsequent to the theft, occurred in the State of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.034" offset="571538">Early in September, 1948, Rocco took some west Penn power bonds and some treasury bonds not directly involved in this case to Parnell.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.710" offset="630262">Parnell took the bonds to the first National Bank in Indiana of which he was a director.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.410" offset="660982">At the bank, Parnell dealt with one (Inaudible) the cashier of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.467" offset="693269">And the latter cost this first lot of bonds to be sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.994" offset="719391">Now, when the bank received credit, Parnell was notified by telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.906" offset="743006">He went down to the bank and was handed a cashier's check for the proceeds plus a small service charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.662" offset="774040">He immediately endorsed the check and took the proceeds and bills of $100 each and a few smaller bills though the amount was nearly $25,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.878" offset="834853">Eighteen days later, Rocco brought to Parnell, $19,600 in Home Owners' Loan Corporation bonds which where the petitioner's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.934" offset="891068">Parnell took these to the bank which transmitted them to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, the Pittsburgh branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.624" offset="929834">Again, when the credit came through, Parnell was notified by telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.354" offset="952822">He went down to the bank, received the cashier's check this time, for $19,590, which he then endorsed and received the proceeds in cash, in bills of a hundred dollars and less.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.710" offset="1022203">And twenty seven days later, in October 1948, Rocco gave to Parnell and Parnell brought to the bank $38,000 in Home Owners' Loan Corporation bonds and the same procedure was followed and Parnell eventually cashing the check for $37,980, and taking it in one hundred dollar bills and smaller denominations.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.543" offset="1145501">Now, it's these two latter lots of bonds of $57,600 in face amount for which this suit is brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.818" offset="1198686">There were, at first, four defendants Rocco, Parnell, the lawyer, the First National Bank in Indiana, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.417" offset="1265037">The trial court dismissed the suit as to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and that is no longer involved in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.814" offset="1302653">After a trial before a jury, verdicts and judgement were rendered against Rocco, Parnell, and the First National Bank in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.252" offset="1348420">Rocco did not appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.842" offset="1358764">So, he, is no longer before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.087" offset="1375692">I may say that he is now in prison having been convicted of the crime of transporting stolen bonds in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.966" offset="1419264">Parnell and the First National Bank in Indiana took an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.414" offset="1456985">And they there obtained a reversal from the full bench of that Court by a four-to-three decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.877" offset="1494915">And the case is now here on certiorari to review that decision .</text>

            <text syncTime="371.223" offset="1588224">They were then cancelled and the fact that they were stolen was apparently not discovered for several months later at which time agents of the FBI visited the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.871" offset="1642872">The facts became known and the various -- the criminal proceeding against Rocco and one or two other civil proceedings and in particular this civil proceeding eventuated.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.769" offset="1690415">But the Federal Reserved Bank as the fiscal agent of the United States cashed the bonds without the detecting the fact that they had been stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.747" offset="1734405">The complaint in this case in each of its several counts at pages 13, 14, and 15 of the record, states that on or about certain dates, the defendant converted to his own use a certain Home Owners' Loan Corporation bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.544" offset="1821550">That is what the suit is for.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.051" offset="1827610">It is for a conversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.402" offset="1840985">The action was brought in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.698" offset="1870137">The basis for jurisdiction there being diversity of citizenship.</text>

            <text syncTime="484.763" offset="2042441">-- was brought as a diversity case.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.375" offset="2056861">A trial was held which lasted for five days.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.696" offset="2074206">At the close of the evidence, the trial court charged the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.595" offset="2097716">And the legal question which is before this Court turns on the correctness of this charge and is basically, I think a very simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.507" offset="2145364">In order that the Court may see in small compass precisely what the issue is, I'd like to ask you to turn to page 422 of the record which is in the midst of the Court's charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.511" offset="2217462">The important language is on that page about two inches from the top of the page in the third sentence and the second paragraph of the page as the Court said, "As I have indicated however, in this -- in the case and if you find in this case that the plaintiff own these bonds that they were stolen from it, then the burden of proof so far as this plaintiff is concerned, is to show that fact that these bonds were owned by it, that they were lost by it in the manner as shown by the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.039" offset="2379525">Then the two defendants, Parnell and the bank, not claiming to the owners per value, but as conduits for redemption, must come forward and they then have the burden of showing that they acted innocently, honestly and in good faith.”</text>
            <text syncTime="592.604" offset="2473775">And the sole question in the case, I think, is the correctness of that last sentence which put the burden of proof on the defendants, Parnell and the bank, to come forward and they then have the burden of showing that they acted innocently, honestly, and in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.693" offset="2566144">Now, if for any reason that charge is wrong, if the burden should not have been put on the defendants, then it seems to me quite obviously that the defendants are entitled to a new trial even though the evidence would have justified the verdict reached, they're entitled to a trial given to the jury on proper instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.847" offset="2650781">On the other hand, if this charge is correct, then it seems to me there is no material factual question before this Court or any other court.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.563" offset="2689651">It is overwhelmingly clear on the record that the defendants have not maintained the burden of proving that they acted innocently, honestly, and in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.991" offset="2739388">On the basis of that charge, the jury found a verdict, the $57,600 against the three defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.318" offset="2780662">And thus, the jury must have concluded that the defendants did not meet the burden of proving that they had acted innocently, honestly, and in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.846" offset="2834787">It may be pointed out, too, that the verdict had the approval of the trial judge who also saw and heard the witnesses in denying a motion for a new trial and disappears on Page 447 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.438" offset="2909080">Now, the trial judge said the question as to whether defendants Parnell and the Bank in Indiana acted innocently and in good faith was for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.629" offset="2957876">The jury has spoken and it is believed that the verdict is just and proper under the evidence presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.680" offset="2990059">In the opinion of the Court, substantial justice is done by the jury's verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.633" offset="3029870">We come now to the question of law, which makes this case one which ought to be before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.664" offset="3069994">It is wholly clear, I believe, that the charge was correct if the case is one, being a diversity case, which should be governed by the law of Pennsylvania, either pursuant to the Conformity Act of 1789 and this Court's decision in Erie Railroad or as the appropriate law in a case involving private property rights in Government bonds.</text>

            <text syncTime="780.189" offset="3224116">No, I believe it is a fair statement to say that there is none.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.850" offset="3234774">I think they ought to speak for themselves but no such suggestion is made in their briefs that the charge was not right as a matter of Pennsylvania law.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.551" offset="3277615">The respondents contend and the majority of the court below has held, that since the subject matter of the transaction was Government bond or more specifically, bonds of the Home Owners' Loan Corporation guaranteed by the United States, that this is a matter where the question of liability should be decided according to "federal" law.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.563" offset="3389628">I put the “federal” in quotation marks because it's not easy to see just where this federal law comes from but it is apparently some different law than the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.164" offset="3439992">On that basis, the court below held that the charge was wrong and reversed the judgments of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.156" offset="3480012">Now, our position on this question falls into two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.781" offset="3498506">First, that this is a suit for the conversion of property between two private persons where the Government is not a party, where the liabilities of the Government are not affected in any way, shape or manner, and that there is no basis for a conclusion that such a question should be decided according to any sort of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.787" offset="3594533">I may point out here, now, that there is no applicable federal statute, no applicable federal regulation which undertakes, in any way, to deal with the question of the transfer of such bonds as these or with the rights of private persons with respect to such transfers.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.021" offset="3691499">There are federal regulations that deal with the rights of the Government when they are paid but not with respect to the transfer of rights between individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.522" offset="3737475">And it is our contention, second, that even if this is a question which should be governed by some sort of federal law, we still have to consider what is the proper source of a rule in such a case, and that the applicable source of a federal rule should be found in the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law, enacted by every one of the 48 States and by Congress for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.678" offset="3862131">And that the federal rule, the federal law should not be found as the court below found it in decisions of this Court rendered in 1864 and 1885 before the field was generally codified in this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="1028.816" offset="4218650">-- that of course, that point was made very well by Mr. Justice Jackson in a -- in a case cited by Mr. Dumbauld, Davies Warehouse Company against Bowles where the Price Control Act, the Federal Price Control Act exempted public utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.073" offset="4299630">And the Court held that once a public utility depends upon the law of the several States and in the course of that opinion, Justice Jackson said, "A federal system makes a merit, instead, of the very local autonomy in which complexities are inherent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.355" offset="4364831">And he went on to say, “The great body of law in this country which controls acquisition, transmission and transfer of property which defines the rights of its owners in relation to the State or the private parties is found in the statutes and decisions of the States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.118" offset="4427839">And we would say that that rule was applicable here and if that is a third alternative I'm glad to put it that way in this particular situation, where we do have a fairly consistent body of uniform law with respect to negotiable instruments throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.877" offset="4494921">It seems to me that the second and the third positions comes very close together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.337" offset="4524701">For the respondents to be successful here, they must both maintain, they must maintain both the proposition that this is to be governed by a uniform or some sort of a federal law and not state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.310" offset="4584573">And they must maintain the proposition that that law is to be found in old decisions of this Court, rather than in the modern and Negotiable Instruments Law adopted by every state or as Justice Frankfurter has suggested in the rules of law adopted in the several States on this proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.235" offset="4684361">Before I go further, I'd like to deal with one matter which is raised throughout the respondents briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.797" offset="4718529">They complained that we say that they were not holders in due course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.327" offset="4744652">They say they don't claim to be holders in due course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.165" offset="4768057">They were merely converts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.673" offset="4778088">And that they cannot, therefore, be subjected to liability as holders in due course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.767" offset="4798464">Now, that's a new conception to me that you are subjected to liability as a holder in due course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.007" offset="4823437">Of course, being a holder in due course is not a basis for liability, it's a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.543" offset="4845589">And it's a very useful defense, too, when you can bring yourself within it, which I believe the respondents cannot do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.022" offset="4883414">If they don't want to be holders in due course, it's quite alright with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.589" offset="4905775">It merely means that they don't claim that defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.123" offset="4923852">The case, then, is left as an ordinary suit for conversion as if it was a car or an automobile that was involved here instead of a bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.582" offset="4969723">But as an ordinary suit for conversion, there can be no doubt that the two respondents dealt with the plaintiff's property and that as a result of those dealings, the plaintiff lost its property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.233" offset="5020296">That's what a conversion is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.179" offset="5032103">On the basis of these facts, the respondents are liable to the plaintiff by ancient and well-established principles of the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.481" offset="5073272">They can avoid that liability only by establishing some sort of a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.267" offset="5100440">A possible defense is that of being a holder in due course but they disclaim that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.820" offset="5122696">The only other defense that I can conceive is one which would require them to prove that they acted in good faith.</text>

            <text syncTime="1464.716" offset="5962271">He must have known at that time that the past due coupons had been called.</text>

            <text syncTime="1496.372" offset="6088808">Indeed our view would be, that the very confusion and uncertainty in Parnell's testimony was a factor which the jury might well have taken into account in concluding that he did not maintain the burden of proving.</text>

            <text syncTime="1535.995" offset="6247320">Morgan against the United States which involved Government bonds which had been acquired by a fiscal agent of the United States within about three months after they are called.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.080" offset="6307715">Now, this agent had been authorized by an Act of Congress to carry out what amounted to a refunding of the bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.789" offset="6334568">That is to get in the old 6% bonds and to issue in their place some bonds at a lower rate of interest, as I recall it, at 4%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.697" offset="6374170">And this fiscal agent took these bonds about three months after the call date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.281" offset="6400502">It turned out that the bonds had been stolen and a suit was brought in the Court of Claims which eventually came to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.059" offset="6435610">And this Court held that the fiscal agent was protected, that having taken the bonds within three months, it was entitled to the defenses of a bonafide purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.454" offset="6489213">Now actually the language of that case is pretty broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.702" offset="6502170">The language of the case says that until the bonds or the due date on the bonds is reached, not the call date, that they remained negotiable instruments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.083" offset="6555669">The Court talks in what seems to us today to be a rather -- in a rather unreal fashion to say that people might like to keep these bonds as the equivalent of cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.797" offset="6594539">They'd be much more convenient since they take up less room than a -- a lot of cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.371" offset="6612825">But I don't think that's the way we think they, and our position would be, that Morgan against United States is a pretty good case as applied to bonds taken within a reasonable time after the call by a fiscal agent of the United States carrying out the policy of the United States and refunding the bonds that it ought not to be extended to a --a case such as this where the bonds were four and a half years pass the call and had eight past due interest coupons attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.022" offset="6739466">And in that connection, I would call attention to a passage in this Court's decision, another old one of about that time, Parsons against Jackson in 99 U.S., where the Court said, the presence of the past due and unpaid coupons was, itself, an evidence of dishonor as sufficient to put the purchasers on inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.465" offset="6829223">The court below relied primarily on the Clearfield case, Clearfield Trust Company against the United States, 318 U.S. 363.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.805" offset="6882617">That case involved a government check which was presented to a retail store with a forged endorsement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.262" offset="6916472">The store paid it, sent it to its bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.990" offset="6927339">The bank endorsed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.579" offset="6933713">Prior endorsements guaranteed, sent it to the Federal Reserve Bank which presented it to the Treasury and the Treasury paid it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.214" offset="6960253">Some time later, the Government found the forgery and sought to recover from the Clearfield Trust Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.697" offset="7006124">Under the law of Pennsylvania, where that transaction occurred, the Government had not given notice soon enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.496" offset="7037367">It had not acted promptly enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.506" offset="7053354">When the case came to this Court, the Court held that the Government would not be bound by the law of Pennsylvania and that this was a matter which should be governed by a uniform federal rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.081" offset="7111659">The Court then undertook to fashion that uniform federal rule in essence out of the negotiable instrument cases which this Court had developed during what might be called the regime of Swift and Tyson, and concluded in that case that the Government was not barred by reason of the fact that it had not complied with the law of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.157" offset="7216044">Now, we would point out the obvious fact that Clearfield involved the rights of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.521" offset="7253452">It did not involve the rights of private parties between themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.220" offset="7276231">The fact that Clearfield has been decided does not lead to any conclusion that all things with respect to Government bonds must be decided by a federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.021" offset="7327431">This Court has since decided a great many cases holding that matters of obvious federal importance are, nevertheless, to be governed by state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1835.413" offset="7444982">We would suggest that if there is to be a federal rule in this case, that it ought to be prescribed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.176" offset="7488031">And that this Court should not move in and occupy a field where Congress has not indicated at any time, over a century and a half, that it feels the need of a federal rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1896.700" offset="7690219">It provides that a buyer in the ordinary course of business of fungible goods, heretofore or hereafter sold and physically delivered by a warehouseman or other dealer, who is regularly engaged in the business of buying and selling such goods, shall take or begin to have taken such goods free of any claim existing or hereafter arising by the Commodity Credit Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.224" offset="7780289">And then it goes on to provide, and this seems to me to be very significant as indicating what Congress thinks about such things if it ever feels it's desirable to think about them, the final sentence in the statute is, to be entitled to relief under this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.362" offset="7840789">A buyer must assert as an affirmative defense and establish by a preponderance of the evidence the facts necessary to entitle him to such relief, of which facts are, that he bought such goods per value and in good faith and did not have reason to know of any defect and so there's authority to sell such goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.251" offset="7944338">These questions are developed at greater length in our brief and we have also presented a reply brief which deals with some of the questions dealt within the respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.699" offset="8006196">I don't have opportunity to go into them at greater length.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.075" offset="8023646">But in summary, our position is, that this is not an area which is suitable or necessary for a uniform federal rule even if this Court should decide that there should be a federal rule here, unless Congress acts, we aren't going to get a uniform federal rule for 50, 75 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.362" offset="8112776">If this Court is willing to review a large number of Negotiable Instruments Law cases every year, it can in the course of time, develop a body of federal law which will serve as a guide to counsel on others as to what the rule is in such cases but to what end?</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.040" offset="8195532">What plausible gain is there to anyone to have a federal rule as to how Government bonds are transferred while there is established, a -- a well-established and well-accepted and well-thought out and worked out and provided by statute, a State series of rules dealing with the transfer of such property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.989" offset="8283303">And so we contend that this is not a matter which should be governed via federal rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.530" offset="8305455">And further, that even if it should, for some reason or other, be governed by a federal rule, that that rule should be found in the laws of the several States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2066.775" offset="8370448">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.117" offset="8379852">The main issue in this case is whether a bank or other party acting solely as a convert or intermediary in the redemption process when government coupon bearer bonds are forwarded through channels of the Federal Reserve System for redemption can be held liable in the absence of proof of bad faith or notice of some infirmity or irregularity for conversion of the bonds handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.527" offset="8565530">If I may just dwell for a moment upon the fact, I want to emphasize that Parnell and the bank simply took the bonds in the condition received.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.333" offset="8620701">The bank sent them by registered mail to the Federal Reserved Bank of Cleveland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.270" offset="8648495">The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland as fiscal agent for the United States definitively redeemed the bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.702" offset="8686216">And then as the regulations provide, credited of its member of bank's account, the First National Bank of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.945" offset="8723101">And that bank, thereupon, issued its check to Parnell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.180" offset="8744103">Parnell cashed the check.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.281" offset="8752462">Their testimony was the bank didn't carry any bills over hundred dollars, so it was in small denominations, less than $100 if that's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.821" offset="8806693">And then turned over the proceeds to Rocco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.408" offset="8824978">And the -- later, some months later, it's developed that these bonds had mysteriously disappeared from the plaintiff's banking house in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.850" offset="8874820">But there was no evidence, which we think, warranted going to the jury to show any notice on the part of either Parnell or the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.038" offset="8931558">Now, the trial court treated this as an ordinary or garden variety of diversity case, applied state law under Erie and seized upon a provision in the Pennsylvania Negotiable Instruments Law which says there is a presumption that a holder is a holder in due course and then if there's an irregularity in the inception of his title that the burden is upon the holder to prove every element of being a holder in due course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.441" offset="9045138">Now, our contention is here, that this case is not one that falls within the Erie doctrine but that it is governed by the Clearfield doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.081" offset="9091741">In other words, it's a matter of federal law and that this Court should frame the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.481" offset="9117341">And then the main point on which we lay weight is that in framing that rule, a just and workable rule, which will exempt from liability a conduit bank should be framed, And it should not -- the Court should not mechanically apply the State Negotiable Instrument Law, which I believe in fact, that it's held in a Connecticut case which I discovered after writing the brief, is thought to apply not to conversion actions, but the suits brought on the note or the negotiable instrument itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.608" offset="9273762">So that a conduit bank never gives value and giving value is indispensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.168" offset="9304064">It's one of the ingredients of being a holder in due course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.606" offset="9317752">So, what we are asking you to do when you frame the applicable rule is not to say that a conduit bank has to prove it's a holder in due course, in order to be exempt from liability for conversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.300" offset="9372609">It should be sufficient merely to say that it is a conduit bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.926" offset="9399045">It doesn't give value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.461" offset="9405210">It invested no fines of its own in these bonds and it dispersed what it received.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.175" offset="9432064">And we -- and the trial court said if we had given value, if we bought these for our own portfolio, then he would have directed the verdict for the First National Bank of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.146" offset="9479920">But he says since we were merely a conduit bank, a different rule should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.150" offset="9503953">And he applied to us a more severe standard of proof than to the defendant, Rocco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.610" offset="9529762">I turn to the same page of the record as my learned friend, and you'll notice, if you read a little further down to the bottom, he says that Rocco is entitled to the presumption of being a holder in due course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.442" offset="9589112">The plaintiff has the burden against Rocco, the rest and all the way through the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.507" offset="9609383">But as to the bank which is a mere conduit and which set the bonds on for redemption in the condition received and dispersed the proceeds is to be held liable if it fails to meet all the requirements of the NILSA holder in due course.</text>

            <text syncTime="2483.226" offset="10036328">And we submit that Judge Goodrich in his dissenting opinion below is really just manipulating verbal concepts in trying to make out holders and holders in due course.</text>

            <text syncTime="2620.068" offset="10583646">And I now I want to make four comments about the Clearfield case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.894" offset="10602977">In the first place, the language of the Clearfield case is not limited as my learned friend suggests to transactions in which the Government itself is a party litigant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.482" offset="10657311">We quote from that case the reference to transactions from issuance to payment which it says would arise in many different States and where uniformity should exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.015" offset="10715408">So, we say that the language of Clearfield, clearly, is extensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.383" offset="10740903">And we know that it has been cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.434" offset="10749158">It's a procreative precedent that's been cited in many cases which are listed in our brief but we can't go over here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.558" offset="10785625">Secondly, the fact of the Clearfield case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.194" offset="10804120">The liability that was there asserted was a liability of a bank on an endorsement which it made in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.181" offset="10844139">That was a transaction between issuance and payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.545" offset="10861589">It was a transaction not directly dealing with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.627" offset="10885831">Of course, one person's duty is another person's right and in that sense the Government was seeking to assert liability on the bank arising out of its endorsement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.772" offset="10938493">But we say that the liability of that endorsement which was an operative event in Pennsylvania, in the Clearfield case was not one dealing directly with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.714" offset="10990216">It was one of these transactions and there -- say you say between transferees of the paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.391" offset="11020936">Now, thirdly, I want to point out that my learned friend in page 20 of his brief makes a great deal about the case of United States versus Guarantee Trust Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.938" offset="11071091">Now, if you do not distinguish that on the ground that it involved the foreign bills sent to a foreign country, the case clearly evaporates when you consider that it is a free Clearfield decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2978.291" offset="12016515">Now, the fourth point is that in the Clearfield case, it was clearly held that when that check was issued for a WPA worker, that was the payment of a debt of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3003.474" offset="12117243">Now, we say that that is also and equally true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.767" offset="12134484">When the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland redeemed these Government bonds, it was exercising a constitutional power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.791" offset="12178578">So that obviously, insofar as Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland is concerned, we have a question, a transaction governed by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.310" offset="12216613">And we say that if it governs one party to the transaction, the federal law governs also the other party to the transaction, namely, the First National Bank in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.881" offset="12262902">And I venture to go a step further and say that the whole entire process of redemption is a matter governed by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.755" offset="12302399">They didn't sue here the postal clerk who registered the letter or the mailman who delivered the bonds at Cleveland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.553" offset="12333537">They might as well have in our view, because the whole process of redemption is one governed by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.929" offset="12367078">We don't say that all transactions about bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.456" offset="12381184">I remember the -- the case about transferring a radio station in Nebraska or you might have a sale of a motor carrier requiring approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission or the Communications Commission and you could have some questions under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.837" offset="12450670">Similarly, you might have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.418" offset="12457044">But here, we're dealing only with the redemption of Government bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.273" offset="12480449">And we submit that here, Clearfield applies and that it should and must apply in order to protect the nature of these securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.109" offset="12531858">I call attention to the Standard Oil case about the soldier sovereign relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.011" offset="12559444">And if the Court says that if the Federal Government can create the relation, it can protect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.131" offset="12583894">And so here, that Congress and the Secretary of the Treasury have determined that these shall be negotiable bonds, the Government has an interest in their free negotiability and that the rule suggested by the minority below requiring a record to be kept of the roots.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.414" offset="12661008">The others say that these bonds passed through in order to validate the transactions under state law would substantially impair the exercise of the Federal Government's policy in shaping the public debt structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.114" offset="12739793">So that, now, I think I have made clear that our first point is that Clearfield governs, federal law governs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.109" offset="12771767">Secondly, in fashioning the rule, you should take a workable rule, a just rule that will exempt parties in this position and not mechanically apply the procrustean categories of the Negotiable Instruments Law of Pennsylvania.</text>

            <text syncTime="3323.232" offset="13396302">May the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.595" offset="13409782">In the short time alloted to me, I would like to call the Court's attention particularly, I think, to the most important factors of the case as it is before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.600" offset="13469759">First, if I may borrow, Mr. Griswold's own definition as I noticed he used it of the basic part of this action conversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.376" offset="13512913">He defined it as a conversion to his own use or as the case may be, it's own use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.787" offset="13538513">And I think that is the problem which we have before us here now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.818" offset="13554604">And the problem that the courts, United States State Courts also have been confronted with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.345" offset="13588773">And in mentioning that, it leads me to a discussion which it was referred to that I would state next with reference to the First National Bank of Blairstown versus Goldberg case, a Pennsylvania case and I believe the lead case on the Pennsylvania law on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.142" offset="13671946">I will mention it in passing here so that this Court may know that that was a case in which not only was Goldberg an individual party, but a bank as a transmittal agent or conduit as the case maybe was also a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.509" offset="13733386">And in the Pennsylvania decision, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed a judgment in all the in favor of that bank stating that there was no proof upon which to support a verdict against the bank and that therefore the judgement in a way should be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.824" offset="13806634">I mention that as Pennsylvania law we can go to New York law and find that same scienter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.636" offset="13837876">To go on from there, to the problem of the Negotiable Instruments Law as such, the problem there is that the petitioner is trying to use a section of the Negotiable Instruments Law whether it be used as a source of federal law here or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.922" offset="13927111">And we maintain most vigorously, although I will not have time to advocate that particularly that it is, for that matter, subject to being examined insofar as the source of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.868" offset="13990849">But the section of the Negotiable Instruments Law which the petitioner is attempting to use utterly will not fit the circumstances of the defendant, First National Bank in Indiana, the respondent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.714" offset="14046229">The section which he refers to, presupposes a purchaser situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.508" offset="14081442">This bank is not a purchaser and as is done everyday throughout the course of commerce bear instruments both the United States Government and otherwise are taken by in by banks unquestioned, almost without meeting the party, in many instances without the meeting the party who brings it there to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.980" offset="14163257">It's brought by a messenger, in many instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.375" offset="14172871">In the great value of United States Government Securities, today, is the fact that they can pass freely from hand to hand that a messenger from a brokerage house may carry them to a bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.137" offset="14227937">And that they maybe transmitted on from there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.874" offset="14242879">The petitioner mentions the ex post facto Uniform Commercial Code as a guide to what might be a modern trend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.367" offset="14304841">And I would call this Court's attention to the section which the -- to which the petitioner refers and call the attention particularly to the fact that it says, “except in case of purchase”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.018" offset="14355414">That then this one year or two-year limitation on the fact of the attachment to the coupons applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.056" offset="14391568">And in coming then to the fact of the coupons being here attached leads us to the federal regulations with reference to United States Government securities of all kind and including those which are guaranteed, of course, by the United States Government as in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.527" offset="14481429">The regulation states, specifically, that upon call, the coupons, inoperative coupons, I believe, in the briefs, as have been submitted by petitioner in this case, they very often probably, inadvertently, referred to them as overdue coupons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.716" offset="14562200">It's an easy error to fall into.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.381" offset="14576933">However, it is important to note that these were merely inoperative coupons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.025" offset="14595427">That as of the date of the call, those coupons should be left attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.263" offset="14612459">And we refer in our brief particularly, to that point that the United States Government regulation state that these coupons shall be left attached to the bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.968" offset="14655195">And I think it will be found that the Federal Reserve Bank would refuse to carry them through regular channels, had those coupons not been attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.644" offset="14693961">The -- the suspicious circumstance, in other words, would have been had those coupons been taken off, for some reason or other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.441" offset="14717158">These bonds were taken in a condition received by the Bank in Indiana and transmitted by registered mail a distance of 60 miles, I believe it is, approximately from Indiana, Pennsylvania to the Cleveland branch of the Federal Reserve Bank at Pittsburg, Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.251" offset="14792391">They were then, of course, as has been stated by a counsel previously, return -- the -- the credit was then returned by mail to the bank in Indiana and only at that time did the bank then pay, describing clearly what has been our position from the inception of this case even in pretrial argument or pretrial discussion, in the pretrial of the case in the District Court level that these bonds were carried -- carried through in the exact procedure that the United States Government prescribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.841" offset="14958738">The federal regulations further contemplate that member banks of the Federal Reserve System, which by the way, the First National Bank in Indiana was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.519" offset="15009416">It contemplates in a section in which we have referred to in our brief that the bond shall be carried for redemption, that it's cleared for redemption through member banks of the Federal Reserve System.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.127" offset="15079842">In stating that the authorizing -- the credit be made by the Federal Reserve Bank to member banks upon the redemption of such bonds as these.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.857" offset="15130833">It is, therefore, our present position and may I state in conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.369" offset="15168867">That I think a most important factor to look at, is that nowhere in the briefs of petitioner has there been suggested any remedy or any means whereby the United States Government bonds may be redeemed safely and securely through the ordinary channels of commerce, unless this Court applies the United States law, the federal law on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.375" offset="15284851">The bonds were negotiable in the very highest sense of negotiability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.980" offset="15311287">And we think, therefore, that it was on -- the burden was on the petitioner to show that which it charged, the act of conversion which had the element, not just of touching the bonds but of converting the bonds to its own use.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="3822.986" offset="15395297">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.201" offset="15404178">I think there really isn't any possible basis for doubt as to the law of Pennsylvania in this case nor reason why the case should be remanded for determining that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3838.257" offset="15456423">That the very case to which both counsel have referred in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, the First National Bank of Blairstown against Goldberg is quoted from on page 13 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.081" offset="15511698">And that is a recent case in Pennsylvania, 1941, and is the latest and leading case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.945" offset="15539179">And the language of that case is, it was incumbent upon plaintiff to prove only its ownership and loss of the bonds and the burden would then have to shifted to the defendants to show that they came into possession of the securities under such circumstances as to relieve -- to relieve them from liability of a conversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3879.687" offset="15622144">Now, that is the precise length which the trial court used and discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.639" offset="15641893">It's obvious that he based his charge upon that Pennsylvania case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.447" offset="15665194">And just one other fact in the picture which I didn't cover in my original statement, the testimony of Rocco that when Parnell brought the money to him in cash and he, Rocco, paid Parnell, $5500 to $6000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.560" offset="15741576">Now, Parnell testified that he got $650 as a retainer and counsel fee, but Rocco's testimony not subjected to cross-examination, in any way, was that Parnell got a 10% share and Rocco's words were that, I don't remember whether I gave him his or whether he took it, which seem to us to be some indication of the nature of the transaction that was involved.</text>
