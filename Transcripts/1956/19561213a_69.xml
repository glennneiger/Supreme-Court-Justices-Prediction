            <text syncTime="1456.235" offset="5928312">With the Court's permission, I intend to attempt to convince this honorable body that in case at bar is not similar and should be distinguished from the Rochin case which the petitioner has more or less hung his head on and with the further permission of the Court, Assistant Attorney General Kegel will discuss the applicability or the lack of applicability of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments which has been mentioned briefly by petitioner's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.336" offset="6084733">I intend to use less than half of the time then give Mr. Kegel the balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.251" offset="6108348">In the Rochin case, the opinion was written by the Honorable Justice Frankfurter and one of the questions he asked in there was that had to be determined was whether or not the actions in the Rochin case and to refresh the Court's memory briefly, there, the officers had forced themselves into the home of the defendant, forced their way into his bedroom, saw these capsules of dope laying on the table, that's what they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.276" offset="6216495">The defendant quickly swallowed them then attempted right there to force the capsules from his mouth and enable to do so, they handcuffed him, dragged him down to a hospital, forced the medicine to his stomach and caused him to regurgitate, we covered that evidence which was used against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.254" offset="6284413">And one of the questions Justice Frankfurter asked was whether or not such actions offend the counts of decency and fairness which he expressed the notions of justice of English speaking people, even toward those charges of the most heinous offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.991" offset="6335300">Justice Frankfurter stated that these actions in the Rochin case certainly shocked the conscience of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.367" offset="6368841">In distinguishing the case at bar, I should like to emphasize the fact that in the Rochin case, they started out by an illegal breaking and entering of the defendant's home without any type of processed warrant, whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.710" offset="6422235">This does not exist in the Breithaupt case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1594.797" offset="6482526">There was an illegal arrest made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.863" offset="6490781">They're not able to obtain the capsules, not even be ensured they work though -- having no actual reason to make an arrest, they arrested the defendant in the Rochin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.067" offset="6527666">In this case, the arrest was completely legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.487" offset="6545324">There was an accident, crest of a hill on the wrong side of the road, as far as the defendant was concerned, three limit women lay dead upon the highway.</text>

            <text syncTime="1635.053" offset="6643545">There was no brutality shown in the case at bar as was discussed by the Honorable Justice Frankfurter in the Rochin case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3499.040" offset="14099519">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.779" offset="14106520">I think that in the discussion perhaps there is this one item which has not received as much attention as it might and that is the point that regardless of whether a given act shocks or does not shock, of course, it must be a violation of some right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.615" offset="14205785">And it does not secure every shocking that encompasses the violation of a right, what may be shocking to me or to anyone else they'll still be perfectly within all legal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.993" offset="14263359">And first, we must find some basic right which has been violated and then determine whether that right is so basic, so fundamental as to come within due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.996" offset="14323336">Before getting into that, however, I would like to discuss the violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.310" offset="14356564">First, because some members of the Court believed that per se they are adopted by the Fourteenth Amendment and if there is a violation of those here, then there is automatically a violation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.521" offset="14413406">And secondly, I would like to discuss them because it's apparently the contention of petitioner to some extent that the rights which are violated here are akin to the Fourth and Fifth Amendment violations if they're not violations of those practices, sort of a situation where a violation of the Fourth plus the Fifth equals the violation of the Fourteenth that apparently is the interpretation which petitioner has placed on the Rochin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.104" offset="14551751">As to the supposed violation of the Fourth Amendment, I think there are three reasons, basically why that has not controlled here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.493" offset="14605354">In the first place, the Fourth Amendment prohibits only unreasonable search and seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.518" offset="14637432">Here, there is no question, before there was a valid arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.647" offset="14657912">Where there is a valid arrest, a reason for search is permitted and here I believe that with that arrest, the search of petitioner's body or the blood is just as valid as the search of his house, of his pockets, or of his fingers for fingerprints.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.283" offset="14744534">It all -- it was back to the same basic principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.000" offset="14771388">Historically, also, the privilege granted by the Fourth Amendment was not a privilege of the person but was a privilege of property affects a man's home is his castle and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.546" offset="14829589">And furthermore, there is one additional reason why that could not possibly apply here and that is because it's certainly unreasonable to require more of the states than as required to the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.437" offset="14901164">And under the Weeks case, the evidence, although illegally obtained, if we're worrying about search and seizures, only, would not be excluded unless there was a motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.219" offset="14952260">And of course, here, there was no motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.530" offset="14965530">The only motions which or the grounds of the objection of the trial court were solely on self incrimination, the Fourth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment were never mentioned until the matter came up on habeas corpus.</text>

            <text syncTime="3814.608" offset="15361755">Now, as to the -- as to the Fifth Amendment, of course, it isn't applicable in itself to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.847" offset="15410761">But in addition to that, as far as Fifth Amendment itself is concerned, I think traditionally, it is limited to testimonial compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.215" offset="15448273">I think that is the effect to the ruling of this Court in United States verus (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.077" offset="15475649">That is certainly according to the majority of the students on the subject including Dean Wigmore as opposing counsel stated has been the rule that it is limited to testimonial compulsion and it is largely and these blood test cases, the early ones particularly, where there have been departures from that rule and I think largely because it was appealing amongst Courts at least in the early stages and the development of this scientific test of a type of revulsion against it and this of course was before Rochin and they would look at the possible means of excluding it and the reasons for excluding it and decided that they didn't want to exclude it and either pick the Fourth or Fifth Amendments usually the equivalent state Constitutions as a means for excluding this test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.473" offset="15737292">The Texas case which was cited by counsel for petitioner about the Doctor versus State follows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.075" offset="15771669">And yet, the rest of the Texas law is practically uniform holding that the privilege of self incrimination does not apply with anything except testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="3950.663" offset="15906043">They say, we're not going to permit it and if you want to know why, look at such and such or we believe that this is contrary to these great principles which we have long has espoused but don't -- significantly don't cite too many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.275" offset="15968423">There are, I believe, more cases as far as case law is concerned on the side of permitting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3973.720" offset="15998203">Mr. Justice Douglas in his concurring opinion in -- in Rochin cited a great number of those cases together with cases on other subjects which -- of compulsion rather than blood test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.421" offset="16065076">Well, it seems to me that question which we have here today is just as open as it was before Rochin was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3999.292" offset="16100498">I don't think that Rochin controls the test as Justice Frankfurter stated in discussion that it is -- is not a new test.</text>
            <text syncTime="4014.092" offset="16159744">It's a question of whether a right that's applied to a given factual situation is fundamental, is something in the words of Cardozo, implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, the test which go back to Palko verus Connecticut and Snyder versus Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.444" offset="16233200">And it's the contention of the State of New Mexico that when you take what is done here and compare it with certain rights which we've all considered to be rather fundamental rights which this Court has said are not embraced in the Fourteenth Amendment and are left to the states to decide, we feel that this right to be free from having blood withdrawn while unconscious and used in a trial involving intoxication to determine either guilt or innocence as the test may show, is not for example as fundamental as the right of trial by a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4077.174" offset="16412087">And yet, the right of trial by jury is not guaranteed with the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.413" offset="16441031">We say, also, it is -- it is not as fundamental as the right of testimonial, the freedom from testimonial self-incrimination, which likewise this Court has said, is not guaranteed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4098.584" offset="16497664">We feel that in comparing these cases, which have gone through and said this is a right which is left to the states to determine and exercise their judgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4113.893" offset="16558895">But here, again, we have another situation which is in the same category.</text>
            <text syncTime="4119.997" offset="16583346">We, likewise, feel that perhaps or at least we like to be that this case was the case that the Court was thinking of in the Rochin case where it exclusive cases involving modern Methergine devices for bringing wrongdoers to justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4140.585" offset="16665684">However, the state cases which have been decided since that time have been very split on whether that is the case that was being considered.</text>
