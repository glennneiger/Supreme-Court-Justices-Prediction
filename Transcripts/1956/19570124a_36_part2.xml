            <text syncTime="697.561" offset="2893615">We say that if that be so, Your Honors, may do that as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.035" offset="2923499">Your Honors, after waiting nine months to clarify their status doing that volitionally and without making any -- and knowing that the -- they had divested themselves of control of CNO on January 19, 1954, and that they were in the Netherlands, so to speak, an unregistered investment company.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.396" offset="2996955">They waited for nine months to make their application and they finally filed it on September 20, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.472" offset="3021302">Now, in that application, curiously enough, they'd invest for Interstate Commerce Commission approval of the control of the New York Central system.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.284" offset="3060485">In fact, they quite candidly say in their briefs and here, and said it then, that they don't have to make such an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.760" offset="3086399">On the other hand, what they did do is they claimed that they already had control of the New York Central system with its 73 companies, most of which are carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.243" offset="3128299">And they merely asked for the approval of the merger, of let us say the 73rd company with the 72nd, claiming that that excused the necessity for applying for approval of all 73.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.397" offset="3184933">And we say that -- that our proposition is illogical and fallacious upon its phase and we say it was a wholly and consistent position for them to take and that is precisely what Division 4 for so held at record 426.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.462" offset="3245223">So strange was this merger application, so curiously worded was it that it evoked from Judge Dimock this observation, “The prayer for the approval of the merger is treated as if it were an effective but meaningless incantation to propitiate a medicine man.”</text>
            <text syncTime="805.559" offset="3325576">Now, Alleghany argues that it's subsequent if it didn't have control on May 26, 1954, its subsequent purchases of New York Central stock and it's acquisition of voting rights gave it a control which it did not previously had.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.180" offset="3380120">The first answer to the question is that the ICC findings weren't predicated on subsequent control -- subsequent acquisitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.564" offset="3409586">It -- they did mention 600,000 shares but they found that the control existed as of May 26, 1954 by virtue of a proxy contest, a concept which is statically impossible in the light of the stockholdings of the parties as I have given them to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.644" offset="3469981">It was Young and Kirby control of Alleghany, we say, that was crucial because the issue here is not how many shares of stock New York Central that Alleghany owned, the issue is who controls Alleghany's right to vote the shares which Alleghany owned or to exercise the voting rights which Alleghany acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.149" offset="3536018">And whether Young and Kirby control of these rights, plus their own Central holdings, gave them, as distinguished from Alleghany, control of New York Central, gave them in the language of the statute the power to exercise control.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.779" offset="3594533">Interstate Commerce Commission dealt, not at all, with this aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.488" offset="3613341">Alleghany has argued that under Section 15 (2) of the Act, the ICC orders must be continued and being continued in effect until they are terminated by a subsequent order and that the 1945 orders vesting control of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad in Alleghany perpetuated Alleghany's control, and it's -- perpetuated its carrier's status through these entire proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.671" offset="3726085">Well, we say that it was not possible, legally possible for this to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.505" offset="3741341">The full Commission found that Alleghany was in fact a prison, not a carrier after January 19th, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.452" offset="3777181">We say that on that day, as a result of that finding, Alleghany became an -- an unregistered investment company.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.013" offset="3807378">As such, it could not acquire control of the New York Central system validly without violating Section 7 of the Investment Company Act, which prohibits an unregistered company from acquiring control of any company engaged in Interstate Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.060" offset="3863594">And furthermore, we say that if the 1940 SCC registration was automatically revived by virtue of the loss of the Chesapeake and Ohio on January 19, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.328" offset="3916675">Then in terms of the Investment Company Act, Alleghany violated Section 18 (d) of that statute by issuing a security which did not meet standards of that Section as found by the SCC a few months ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.494" offset="3965367">Now, we say, if the District Court and the United States, and appellees are all wrong about this proposition, about the continuation of the orders and if, as Alleghany claims, that the 1945 order continued and effect throughout 1955 or is still in effect then we say that Alleghany violated the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.365" offset="4044884">Because under the CNO order of 1945, they were granted control of the CNO and given carrier status under Section 5 (3), only under the stipulation which they voluntarily made and which is incorporated in the Commissions order that if they acquired any -- of the stock of any carriers, subsequently any carriers other than the CNO, they would have to put them in a voting trust so as to insulate them against Alleghany voting control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.238" offset="4152299">And we -- and we say also, it violated that provision of the -- of the 1945 order which debarred Alleghany from having an interlocking -- locking directorate with any railroad other than the Chesapeake and Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.528" offset="4201514">And yet, the first thing that Young and Kirby did when they took control of the -- of Central in May 26, 1954, was to elect Young, the chairman of the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.726" offset="4242265">Now, we say therefore, that this argument of continuation and control is sterile one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.788" offset="4262536">It has no impact on this case because no matter how you view it, it's merely an attempt to create a defense to another case in another court and it has no bearing on the issues of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.373" offset="4308825">Now, Alleghany argues that it was never necessary for it to make any control application because when it controlled the 73 companies, it was only controlling one, 73 equals one is the demonstration that they make an effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.296" offset="4376534">The legislative history, which I won't have the time to go into here is set forth from pages 68 to 70 of -- of our brief, and at page 70 we show that as a result of the senate investigation of -- of Alleghany and other investment companies who are holding securities and carriers, the Congress determined to dispel any ambiguity and to close any loophole that might have existed with respect to this very question and by the enactment of the Transportation Act of 1940 and the text language which the Congress enacted at that time, if there wasn't an ambiguity, there wasn't a loophole, it was closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.529" offset="4541524">The text matter that set forth in our brief below, the quotation of the statute at page 70 illustrates our point in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.850" offset="4582797">But Division 4 had no doubt about this, Division 4 had no illusions on the subject of what control of 73 carriers means in terms of ICC standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.747" offset="4626369">But this is what it said in this case, “We have long recognized under Section 5 that railroad systems are comprised of two or more carriers and that control of a single system may not lawfully be effectuated without our approval and authorization."</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.123" offset="4691884">Because that principle is considered basic, almost as a definition, so much so that the question of acquisition of a carrier system has never been contested before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.298" offset="4732531">And as far as we know, there have been no Court decisions touching on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.167" offset="4752071">I know the full Commission repudiated that the finding of the Division 4, but we think the full Commission was wrong and Division 4 was right, and the District Court agreed with the construction that we placed upon it and that Division 4 placed upon at this aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.481" offset="4817272">We say that Alleghany itself acquiesced in this interpretation in 1945 when a proceeding to administer certain sanctions to Alleghany for a failure to have made a -- application for control of CNO reached the stage of a proposed examiner's report and -- in which examined the both that time upheld this very same construction of the statute that we're now claiming for and insisted that an application would have to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.164" offset="4936077">As a matter of fact, it was in settlement of the -- of the potential sanctions that Alleghany was faced with in the 1945 proceeding that the CN order -- CNO order of 1945 finally emerged and the CNO order contains a direct finding that Alleghany had acquired control of the CNO.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.018" offset="5019460">At that time it had control of no other carrier and yet the Commission found it necessary to incorporate it in its order -- in its report in this finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.154" offset="5056031">We further find that acquisition by Alleghany Corporation of control through ownership of stock as above described of the Chesapeake and Ohio, Nickel Plate, Pere Marquette and their subsidiaries and affiliates is a transaction within the scope of Section 5 (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1683.391" offset="6836955">It was an acquisition of lessors and not carriers, and there's a fundamental distinction between lessors and carriers, and it's a distinction recognized both in the statute and by the judicial cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.603" offset="6889827">The term carrier is defined by statute, Section 5 (13) of the Interstate Commerce Act, there's no reference to this in -- in the opposing briefs, “As used in paragraph (2) to (12), and that includes the Section (5) that we're talking about here inclusive, the term carrier means a carrier by railroad and an expressed company subject to this part, namely part I of the Interstate Commerce Act”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.569" offset="6989615">The second sentence of Section 1 (3) (a) of the Act says that, “Whenever the word “carrier” is used in this part, it should be held to mean a common carrier.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.993" offset="7023365">And Section 1 (4) says, “A common carrier has the duty to provide and furnish transportation to establish reasonable through routes with such other carriers in just and reasonable rates.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.198" offset="7072162">Now, we say the necessary effect of that distinction is current upon the phase of the statute, but it's been recognized by at least one -- at least one case that went to the Court of Appeals nor it was the statutory court decision in the group of Boston and Providence Railroad Corporation Stockholders against Interstate Commerce Commission, decided 1955 and affirmed by this Court at 350 U.S. 926.</text>

            <text syncTime="1783.870" offset="7238823">What they sought in that case was not an acquisition -- to approve an acquisition of control that had to do with rate matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.586" offset="7261706">And so the precise question that Your Honor puts to me was not in formulated form before the Court is prepared, it wasn't presented by that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.190" offset="7296084">But -- but if the lessor actually makes an application for control, presumably the -- if the application is granted, it would convert it into a carrier by virtue of the fact to be taken control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.051" offset="7343626">In any rate the question is not here and it wasn't in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1837.664" offset="7454072">Even if we're wrong on the rest of the arguments that we've made, the failure to join Young and Kirby as controlling persons were required Alleghany's application to be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.411" offset="7497017">There is no discussion about this in the ICC brief and we find no reference to it in the Alleghany reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.006" offset="7527424">I believe Mr. Ginnane conceded here there's at least one case that the ICC decided, in which it held that individuals may be necessary and controlling parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.133" offset="7571937">But the findings in this case make it clear that the controlling parties were the individuals, and therefore, when necessary the parties to the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.830" offset="7606732">Division 4, for example, found as a consequence a holding company and those in control thereof admittedly acquired control of a carrier which controls subsidiary carriers, the references to Alleghany and to Young and Kirby.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.130" offset="7667858">The full Commission found that Alleghany and its allied interests have succeeded in electing sufficient members of the board to permit them to organize and elect their own officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.025" offset="7711431">And the finally, the District Court held, “The position taken by the plaintiffs throughout has been that Alleghany was but an instrument employed by the Young, Kirby, Murchison group in the control of the New York Central and was in no sense in control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.532" offset="7773497">It is to be observed that the findings of neither Division 4 nor the ICC met these issues squarely.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.516" offset="7797426">And then the court goes on to say, “We are forced therefore to the conclusion that the findings do no more than say that Alleghany, with someone else, controls New York Central, they do not even say whether did someone else alone has control, does that satisfy the statute?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.812" offset="7874644">That was the question that the District Court opposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.256" offset="7888436">Now, everyone in this case agrees that the Marshall Transport case requires the joinder of controlling parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.780" offset="7914454">That was what it held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.050" offset="7923545">We say that control of New York Central being invested in the individuals, namely, to prior acquittal to use the language in the -- of Division 4 which was adopted by the full Commission and by the Court vested in “those in control.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.390" offset="7984880">And that by reason of the fact, those in control were necessary parties and the application had to be dismissed for failure to join them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.907" offset="8030960">Now, Your Honors, I come to the hearing question which is not a necessarily determined question in this case, unless we our wrong on every other point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.309" offset="8088639">We needed -- we say we didn't need a hearing in order to establish the nullity of these ICC orders, we sell -- we say that they fell by their own weight and by the jurisdictional infirmities which I pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.655" offset="8149974">But we say if we're wrong on every such question, the failure to grant us a hearing renders the orders null.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.816" offset="8182680">Now, with great deference to other side, who suggested here that there was a hearing, I must say that there was no hearing in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.373" offset="8224893">I think they -- what they meant is that we got a hearing when the ICC glanced at our pleadings and in camera so to speak made its decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2326.920" offset="9411062">And therefore, it will have the standing to make the merger application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.716" offset="9430288">The fact is that in the report of the ICC, there is no finding of an acquisition of control by virtue of the merger.</text>

            <text syncTime="2589.671" offset="10462020">I haven't examined it in that light, but I do say this to you sir, that the ICC's jurisdiction is not diminished in one wit because if these lessors did anything at change, they control the railroad, then they would be caught or the Central, the parent company would be caught by the carrier provisions for the first three clauses of Section 5 (2), not the non-carrier provisions of the fourth and fifth clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.426" offset="10541119">So this is not diminishing in one wit the ICC's regulatory powers over these kind of companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.872" offset="10562853">All we're saying here is there was no basis in ICC -- in the ICC statute to find that was an acquisition of control of a carrier by any of these transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.324" offset="10604648">And in the Bridge Company, of course, Big Four is a lessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.235" offset="10624293">And the only carrier who's control is legibly is acquired is this two and a half mile company called the Bridge Company out of some thousand miles of New York Central System.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.517" offset="10677478">And that brings -- it gets one other point, Alleghany claims that it didn't have to make a control application for control of the 73 carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.051" offset="10715617">Although, the statute says in Clause 4 of Section 5 (2), that two or more carriers, whenever their control is acquired, must be authorized and must be approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.188" offset="10760129">And it was Alleghany itself which -- whose activities in 1937 lead to the Senate Interstate Commerce Commission's investigation, which lasted from 1937 to 1940, 27 reports were issued by that committee of which half of them dealt with Alleghany and it was to close the very loophole in the statute which they alleged existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.405" offset="10844975">Then Alleghany alleged -- Mr. Young and Mr. Kirby alleged existed so they -- didn't have to bring a scrutiny of Chesapeake and Ohio control to Alleghany to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.198" offset="10880188">It was that very loophole which was singled out in Senate Report Number 180, mentioned in our brief and which it should be closed if it exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.277" offset="10924492">We don't think it exists under one interpretation, the courts may find it doesn't exist under a null kind of interpretation of the 1933 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.083" offset="10951659">But if it does exist, it should be closed and we don't think that any fine spent arguments now when it's right, this should await further action by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.486" offset="10985305">In 1940, Congress amended the statute and made, in its own words, clarifying changes, that's in the conference report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.054" offset="11015607">I don't want to detail the statutory changes that are on page 70 of our brief but they do say in effect, if you acquire control of two or more carriers through ownership of their stock then you have to come to -- to the Commission, that was the 1933 statute, through ownership of their stock, mind you, from -- in -- in that posture of the statute, New York Central was the only stock whose -- whose acquisition is of course being acquired by Alleghany.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.488" offset="11133367">It didn't go to the 72 other carriers because no ownership of the 72 carriers stock was being acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.100" offset="11163773">Therefore, the statute was amended to say, if you acquire control of two or more carriers through ownership of their stock, or otherwise, those two words we put in, or otherwise, therefore, when you acquire the control of New York Central Company, just one stock transaction, it didn't acquire control of the 72 through ownership of their stock, you acquire control of them or through the otherwise clause because Central had that stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.810" offset="11258650">And the Senate Report said, this is an -- an ambiguity in the statute, they used that very word, there's an ambiguity here and the proof is ambiguity, Mr. 's Young and Kirby and the people before them were crossing around the control of a great railroad system as if it were a tie balloon, that's the words of the chairman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.226" offset="11320299">It was chairman of the committee in 1937 and chairman in 1940 and that's why this -- this statute should be amended to prevent this kind of -- of transfer of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.869" offset="11358856">I want to make one more reference to this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.768" offset="11366484">Mr. Ginnane refers to the difficulty of proxy contestants if this interpretation of the statute which we think is the law is adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.026" offset="11399502">He says that everybody who acquires control in the proxy contest would have to come to -- to the Commission, that isn't so sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.575" offset="11429700">Because if nobody has acquired controlling blocks of stock as Young and Kirby did with their associates, their million shares, then of course, without any controlling blocks of stock for 10,000 stockholders have control, but they don't exercise it until that one day they come together for the meeting and they voted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.787" offset="11502529">And they merely had voted, the directors take office and the stock control is dissipated again among the 10,000 units or whatever the number of stockholders maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.047" offset="11535548">If the only coalesces of each election, there is no acquisition of control within the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.298" offset="11560521">And it's only because of this that the -- this argument that Alleghany seeks to avoid scrutiny of the public interest finding that it has acquired control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.417" offset="11593017">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="2881.653" offset="11630007">You'll touch on the Boston and Albany are you?</text>

            <label>Mr. Whitney North Seymour</label>
            <text syncTime="2884.106" offset="11639829">Yes, I will, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.865" offset="11646830">First, the requirement that there should be an application to the ICC for approval of the Bridge Company merger and lease and of the Boston and Albany transaction is squarely required by your decision in the New York Central Securities case, which has been followed for more than 20 years and which lays it down that any change in form of control as an acquisition of control under the statute, there's nothing new or novel about the doctrine, it's been followed by the Commission in hundreds of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.655" offset="11826030">The Government seeks to distinguish it in this case because it says that that case involved a lease transaction but so does the Bridge Company proceeding here and my very friend, the Solicitor General, simply overlooked that in making that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.453" offset="11905233">Now, counsel on the other side persuaded the court below that a special urgent deficiencies court should enforce other statutes and not merely review the ICC orders, and apparently he seeks here to try his minority stockholder suit which is pending in a one-judge court below because his argument has been full of references outside the record, many of them, in exact, and I shall try to medium on those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.296" offset="12032606">Your Honors will have notice that, again and again, he referred to things which are not in this record at all, which transpired after this docket has closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.784" offset="12070536">And on the question that control of New York Central, I submit that the findings of the Commission clearly determine that New York Central was controlled by Alleghany, certainly it -- it was controlled by Alleghany along with Alleghany's nominees and this is taken directly from a statement made by the plaintiff or appellee, Breswick, at page 322, in which he said by a reason of said prohibited and unlawful acts, Alleghany Corporation and it's nominees were successful in acquiring on June 14, 1954 the control of the New York Central Railroad Company and its system companies and that it's continued since.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.853" offset="12266768">Now, I don't think it's an inadequate answer to that kind of a deliberate statement to the Commission that that's only the first, out of seven or eight pleadings which varied all over the line, I think the Commission was entitled to take into account that it is not dealing here with amateurs but with professionals who make these statements and that when a statement like that is made, the fact that later for other reasons, some other statement may be made is no reason to disregard this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.330" offset="12376691">There was adequate evidence to sustain the Commission's findings and under the decision in the Rochester case, which is referred to this morning, the Court shouldn't consider disturbing those findings.</text>

            <text syncTime="3087.417" offset="12453073">I think plainly they were not necessary parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.247" offset="12468328">The Commission has not followed the practice of adding individuals to touch a control to such a proceeding and as regarded, as I understand it, the control over the holding company as the supervision that it need, but even assuming that it went to that point, I don't see what standing the plaintiffs have to make an objection to that -- to -- to that result.</text>

            <text syncTime="3125.513" offset="12605419">And I'll come -- I'll answer that right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.187" offset="12616077">The point is made -- was made for the first time in appellee's brief that there's some distinction between a lessor and a carrier as to the requirement of getting approval under Section 5 (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.240" offset="12664351">We've analyzed that argument in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.630" offset="12673860">It's perfectly clear that even though for some purposes a company may be a lessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.710" offset="12706252">If it is a railroad company and a carrier, it must get approval under 5 (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.983" offset="12735300">The case cited by counsel is a decision dealing with the question of whether a particular company was entitled to a separate rate and hasn't anything to do with the question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.731" offset="12778245">And Mr. Ginnane tells me that there are two decisions in the Commission holding that a -- because the company may be a lessor, it's nevertheless a carrier in 261 I.C.C. 623 and in 257 I.C.C.796.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.317" offset="12844596">And I think -- submit there's nothing in the point that Boston and Albany case, standing alone without anything more, is enough to establish continued regulation by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.383" offset="12892871">And it's perfectly plain that if any defects existed in any earlier orders, the Commission would have asserted jurisdiction again over Alleghany in connection with that proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.852" offset="12938742">And except for the point about the lessor, which is absolutely without merit, no one challenges the validity of the exercise of jurisdiction by the Commission in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3229.084" offset="13019721">Counsel has referred to alleged over reaching by Mrs. Young and Kirby to allege profits by Mr. 's Young and Kirby.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.544" offset="13053576">And to things of that kind, I submit that if there were time, we could litigate those questions here but this isn't the place for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.975" offset="13095267">Those are matters which have been repeatedly denied and have no proper place in -- in the -- the disposition of this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.077" offset="13131630">The SCC made no such findings, the staff finding is to the contrary and that finding was not disturbed by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.187" offset="13168097">Finally, on this point, counsel rather suggested that the SCC always challenged the jurisdiction of the ICC and I submit that while the SCC showed a preference for having the jurisdiction transferred to it, a preference which Congress had pretty well taken care off by the terms of the Investment Company Act, it always recognized the jurisdiction of the ICC and there is still an outstanding order of the SCC continuing that jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.273" offset="13304456">And therefore, I submit that the judgment should be reversed in its entirety.</text>
