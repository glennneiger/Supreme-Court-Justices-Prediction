            <label>Mr. Donald S. McNamara</label>
            <text syncTime="38.391" offset="256920">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.352" offset="272802">Virgil Herdman, the petitioner in this case was the complainant, the plaintiff in the original trial of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.651" offset="310000">This case was tried in the District Court of Columbus, Ohio and submitted on the basis of res ipsa loquitur.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.800" offset="334555">Only the complainant, the petitioner and his two doctors testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.207" offset="356185">At the end of the case, the Court directed the verdict for the respondent railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.929" offset="379068">Virgil Herdman worked for 22 years for the respondent railroad as a brakeman and as a freight conductor.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.047" offset="423581">Back in 1951, his work then was as a freight conductor.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.020" offset="455450">He worked from Columbus, Ohio to Richmond, Indiana and back on the following day working seven days a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.775" offset="490454">His work as a freight conductor was that of the paperwork on the freight train.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.998" offset="519398">He rode in the caboose and performed his work as the train moved along at prescribed route, from one city to another and from one railroad yard to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.337" offset="564746">He had the responsibility of the bills of lading and as he said, he checked them and wrote them up as the train moved from one place to another and he set of the bills of lading when the cars were set off in their prescribed place.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.140" offset="647920">It was customary that all the paperwork be concluded, by the time the train reached it's -- the end of its destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.721" offset="686268">In the caboose was provided not only a bunk to rest on but a table and chair on which the petitioner was to perform his paperwork as they move from city to city.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.556" offset="737573">Herdman, as he testified, was in charge of the train from the caboose forward to the coal tender, not including the coal tender, the diesel locomotive and the steam locomotive that made up this train.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.359" offset="800789">In February 1st, 1951, the train in which he was riding consisted of about 67 freight cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.944" offset="831195">A diesel locomotive, coal tender and a steam engine on the head end.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.325" offset="852720">They had left Richmond, Indiana and was proceeding eastwardly through Dayton, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.896" offset="874977">Virgil was working in the caboose as prescribed with his paperwork.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.021" offset="899427">When they reached the point within the yard limits or what's called sometimes the Dayton limits of the respondent railroad near the City of Dayton, at a point were there was no reason to stop about three miles as a matter of fact from the next stop, three miles from the next yards, a certain -- a running of a slack occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.099" offset="1011754">The caboose was jerked violently forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.115" offset="1031816">The petitioner was thrown from his position, the edge of a bunk forward into the caboose into the wall and down.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.823" offset="1066715">The man working in the caboose with him landed on top of him, and he sustained personal injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.111" offset="1099839">He got out of the caboose.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.806" offset="1110601">Some few minutes afterwards, he walked outside, heard the air coming back through the air line of the caboose and got back in.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.162" offset="1163995">The railroad owed Virgil Herdman, by common law and under the FELA, a duty to provide him a safe place to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.629" offset="1205896">This is a continuing duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.365" offset="1216867">His safe place to work supposedly was within the caboose area.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.606" offset="1233795">It was there he was to do his work, the same as the engineer in the engine and the fireman in the engine on the locomotive.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.168" offset="1272038">When that violent running of slack occurred, his place to work was then made unsafe.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.994" offset="1303385">He was thrown from one end of the caboose to the other and sustained the injuries to the extent that he has not returned to work since then, that's February 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.846" offset="1358764">He testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.881" offset="1366915">The facts showed that after he got out of the caboose and he heard the air coming back in, he knew then that something had occurred in the frontend of the train to cause the sudden stop of the train and the running of the slack in the subsequent injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.260" offset="1436400">He got back on the caboose.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.908" offset="1442983">They rode on into the Dayton yards, completed their work, come on into Columbus, Ohio and completed the run of the train some time around midnight that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.266" offset="1492407">If the Court please, it is the claim of the petitioner that those facts, so setup showed the duty of the respondent railroad to provide a safe place to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.394" offset="1552906">Those facts show a breach of that duty, which constitutes negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.520" offset="1577462">It is the petitioners claim then, that on the basis of that -- of those facts, he had a right to expect his case to go to the jury on the basis of res ipsa loquitur.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.120" offset="1635871">To go on with the facts a minute, because the defense of the case has been rested primarily upon the facts that occurred after this point, they come on into Columbus, Ohio about midnight.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.288" offset="1688534">Herdman as the freight conductor is charged with all of the paperwork of the train.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.056" offset="1715597">About arriving in Columbus, according to information that came out in the trial on cross-examination and which was objected to, the engineer told Herdman that he had applied the brake in the maximum manner because a car, an automobile went across the crossing.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.394" offset="1816952">Somebody wrote out a report.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.807" offset="1830640">It was Herdman's duty to report, to do the paperwork of making all reports and so forth, and Herdman signed the report that somebody else wrote out that that was what occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.308" offset="1876616">Herdman, 67 cars, a diesel, a tender and a steam locomotive to the rear, of course had no personal knowledge of what took place at the front end of the train.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.349" offset="1916740">He could have no personal knowledge except what somebody else told him had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.045" offset="1943594">When plaintiff's -- the petitioner rested his case on cross-examination they asked Mr. Herdman if he had not made such a report and the testimony as in the record is that he signed the report that somebody else wrote, that he had been told by the engineer that that was what had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.229" offset="2028335">He personally had no knowledge whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.782" offset="2042546">We respectfully submit to the Court, that the evidence shows that the stopping of the train occurred by reason of some conduct, Herdman said, that occurred at the front end of the train.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.994" offset="2107329">Now, there were two locomotives up there.</text>

            <text syncTime="549.544" offset="2301576">The Court - “I will overrule the objection, note exception.”</text>

            <text syncTime="628.797" offset="2618598">Only the petitioner and his two doctors testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.912" offset="2643048">The Court -- the trial court sustained a motion for a directed verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.372" offset="2668857">It was respectfully submitted that this Court has held many times that res ipsa loquitur is a rule of evidence that applies in federal employer -- employee liability cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.035" offset="2723506">Under FELA, the doctrine does apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.044" offset="2743568">This Court has held for Bailey versus Central Vermont in U.S. Administrative cases cited in there show the continuing duty to provide the petitioner with the safe place to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.658" offset="2810023">The act in itself, we think shows a violation of that duty to a point where there is a situation that the jury, an inference of negligence may be drawn by the jury and under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur as it has been described, it is compulsory that the matter go to the jury to determine whether or not there was negligence for which the respondent railroad should be held responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.306" offset="2944606">Now, in the head end -- at the head end of this train, the evidence is that the engineer on the head end on the steam engine could have applied either intentionally or accidentally that control brake to throw this train into a sudden stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.069" offset="3015659">The engineer in the diesel could have intentionally or accidentally thrown the train into this sudden stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.210" offset="3052231">The control arm was described, I guess sort of like, "old street tires" control arms that swings around in a semicircle and can -- as Mr. Herdman said, "There are two ways in which to use that control arm to apply the breaks."</text>
            <text syncTime="757.903" offset="3134986">They have what they call a service application, an application of the break that will bring the train to a smooth stop, which is a matter of common knowledge to everybody in riding trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.035" offset="3179499">That it is possible to bring trains to a smooth even stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.509" offset="3201442">You can then, in the alternative throw the break, the maximum, what the railroad or sometime referred to as big hauler.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.726" offset="3234252">There's a niche-like at the end and they throw it around there and it holds it in position and they big haul it and puts it on the breaks in the maximum condition which then will permit or cause a running of the slack and cause the caboose on the rear end to be jerked forward suddenly and then all of a sudden it runs into the rear of 66 other cars and stops.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.931" offset="3371133">If the Court please, this -- this Court had before it, this fall as a matter of fact, the case that is cited in the brief, the Kansas City Southern Railway in Justice case versus Justice which they denied the petition for a writ by the Kansas City in Southern Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.424" offset="3445112">It was a case where the man in the same position as Herdman, a freight conductor was riding and there they knew that a stop was to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.904" offset="3490983">In the Kansas City Southern case, they knew that a stop was to be made for an inspection and a rush stop occurred sufficiently to throw the conductor from one end of the caboose to the other and he sustained injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.923" offset="3539048">The case went to the jury on res ipsa.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.237" offset="3548348">There was a $45,000 recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.972" offset="3559215">The Circuit Court of Appeals down there, I believe it's the Fifth Circuit sustained it.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.858" offset="3578755">The Railroad then files a petition for a writ here, claiming that the case should not have been allowed to go to the jury on res ipsa and this Court overruled, in October of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.284" offset="3624521">Clearly, I think the elements of res ipsa are all set forth the movement of this train.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.369" offset="3660884">Its actual control movement was in that of the engineers who in substance are the respondents.</text>

            <text syncTime="898.353" offset="3696828">The exclusive control of the movement of the train was in the defendant railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.133" offset="3723891">There is no negligence, no inference of negligence on the part of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.195" offset="3748133">He was working in the place where he was assigned to work and virtually a haul at the rear end of the moving train, where he has no idea, no observation of what goes on and no way can control what goes on, so that the exclusive control is vested in and was in the respondent railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.099" offset="3827754">There is no question that the petitioner was not guilty of any negligence of his own when the sudden stop occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="1732.223" offset="7032247">The issue before Your Honor is a simply one of the plaintiff that has established prima facie case, so well the District Judge and unanimous Circuit of Court of Appeals was correct in directing a verdict for defendant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.198" offset="7080208">The petition in this case was filed in 1951 based on the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.583" offset="7117720">Now, the Court knows that Federal Employers' Liability Act, it is not an insurance law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.045" offset="7139558">It is not a workmen's compensation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.705" offset="7150216">There is liability under the Federal Employers' Liability Act only if the employer is negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.615" offset="7177801">Plaintiff in his complaint filed in 1951 reflects that fact and it has three specific allegations of negligence for which the railroad is charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.783" offset="7218552">One was that the negligence failed to supply a safe place to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.119" offset="7235897">Negligence failed to operate the train, making an emergency stop and finally, negligence to fail to warn the plaintiff to stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.557" offset="7261602">Immediately after filing the complaint, the plaintiff indulged in most elaborate discovery procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.652" offset="7290023">Two different sets of involved detail and regulatories were filed to which sworn answers were prepared and filed to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.807" offset="7318549">Then, the deposition was taken of the engineer, the fireman, everyone else who had any knowledge of this particular accident taken by the plaintiff and prepared and ready for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.308" offset="7360554">And yet, when the plaintiff came on to establish his case, to establish these allegations of negligence, only the testimony of the petitioner or plaintiff, Mr. Herdman was introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.208" offset="7408201">The detailed depositions were not used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.648" offset="7421994">The detailed interrogatories were not used along with the testimony of Mr. Herdman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.860" offset="7446862">A large portions of the record before Your Honors seemed to us to be totally irrelevant to the issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.754" offset="7470373">More than that, some of -- some of the assertions of fact that I have just heard my judgment are completely a departure from those of the record and I should like to review the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.204" offset="7512168">Their facts show that Mr. Herdman had been a conductor for the defendant railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.494" offset="7533380">As such conductor, he was in charge of the train, responsible for its general movements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.111" offset="7551770">It was his -- it was his responsibility to report all incidents in the operation of the train.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.496" offset="7577370">On February 1st, 1951, Mr. Herdman was the conductor of a regular scheduled train running from Richmond, Indiana to Columbus, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.955" offset="7619166">The -- it was a very cold day, an icy day, a slippery day, snow moved through the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.659" offset="7642049">Mr. Herdman was discharging his functions as a conductor riding in the caboose of the train.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.631" offset="7665873">The train had proceeded into the City of Dayton on the mainline of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.652" offset="7685935">It was going through a closely build up section at a speed of some eight to 10 miles an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.550" offset="7713520">As the train approached at Great Crossing on the main streets of the City of Dayton, it went to an emergency breaking situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.355" offset="7748838">Mr. Herdman testifies that it's a result of the brake that he was thrown about in the caboose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.369" offset="7772871">Incidentally, a fellow trainman who was riding with him was not called to testify as to what actually happened at the time of the stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.347" offset="7808711">The question of Mr. Herdman's injuries are not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.186" offset="7820100">Although plaintiff took the liberty in its brief to suggest that Mr. Herdman was seriously injured indicated here today that he hadn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.881" offset="7846849">I think it's only fair that we suggest to Your Honors that we categorically deny that Mr. Herdman was in fact seriously injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.910" offset="7870986">But even as it may, as soon as the emergency stop was made, Mr. Herdman, as it was his responsibility jumped off the caboose and started forward to determine why the emergency stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.000" offset="7915395">After he'd gone past the couple of cars, he heard the air coming back in the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.219" offset="7932217">He turned around and jumped back on the caboose and testified that he had first looked at the -- the air pressure shortly before the accident and then the air pressure came back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.875" offset="7974849">It was normal at the exhaust so he knew there was nothing wrong with the equipment that something had gone on, on the front end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.277" offset="8004524">Shortly after the air pressure came on the train left, went three more miles and the main line of the railroad departed and went into a switching yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.044" offset="8039528">As soon as it has gone the switching yard to let some cars off and pick up some cars, again Mr. Herdman went forward and talked to the engineer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.938" offset="8067114">The engineer told him that the reason he had made the emergency stop was because an automobile of -- appeared to be school children at 3 o'clock in the afternoon had come up to the crossing, stopped, slid over and became stopped directly on the railroad tracks and that for that reason he threw the car, the train into emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.615" offset="8153840">Mr. Herdman then when they arrived in Columbus about midnight made a report of this particular incident and Mr. Herdman the next day filed a written report with the railroad as it was his duty to report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.832" offset="8210683">Now, that has been discussed and I want to again call the Court's attention to the fact that the report was marked for identification purposes as defendant's Exhibit A.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.893" offset="8250911">It was shown to Mr. Herdman on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.046" offset="8259584">Mr. Herdman himself undertook to read that report and did read the report into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.096" offset="8283721">And then, Mr. McNamara said, “We are willing Mr. Barton to read it, if the Court please, if the witness can't make it up,” and then, Mr. Barton read the report with the witness following the report and that report is then this was filed, Mr. Herdman immediately after the accident, "CN 28, Engine 8800 and 5680 moving east through Dayton, with 67 cars, at estimated speed of eight to 10 miles per hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.221" offset="8396257">Automobile drove over crossing just east of Dayton Rubber Works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.724" offset="8418304">To prevent striking the automobile, engineman applied air in emergency causing rough stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.534" offset="8445471">I was standing in the cabin observing air gauge and when stop was made, knocked me to the floor of cabin bruising my hip."</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.844" offset="8474728">Now, if it please the Court, there has been no objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.472" offset="8485282">There was not one objection to this report, the official report, the report made in the ordinary course of business by Mr. Herdman to the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.718" offset="8518196">There was no objection to that report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.993" offset="8527391">They introduced and is a part of this case in chief and is a part of this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.119" offset="8547871">Immediately thereafter, Mr. Barton asked Mr. Herdman about it and he said, “Now, is the fact the way the accident happened, the way the statement -- that statement says” and Mr. Herdman said, "The engineer told me that was the way he did it."</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.312" offset="8600639">But again, there has been no objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.095" offset="8607744">The first objection that was made to any of this testimony was on a third repetition of a portion of it and Mr. McNamara then said, "I object on the grounds of hearsay and improper cross-examination."</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.617" offset="8653824">That objection was overruled and Mr. Herdman has not taken an appeal even at the Circuit Court of Appeals or to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.353" offset="8684753">Mr. Justice Black, it is true that where evidence which is hearsay of this is introduced and is before the Court in the record, it is entitled to its full formative value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.258" offset="8728430">But more than that, gentlemen, this evidence was not hearsay evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.192" offset="8744103">If it was hearsay, it was entitled to admission under the res gestae exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.873" offset="8766882">But more than that, the actual statement, the actual report is admissible under the Ohio statutes for a regular -- records made in the record course of business which under your rule -- Federal Rule 20 something -- 43 (a) is entitled to admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.875" offset="8842846">So, there was no basis to keep this evidence out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.438" offset="8857161">It was proper evidence and it is in record before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.249" offset="8872417">It supplies the answer to why this emergency stop was made and inference of negligence is drawn only at the completion of the entire plaintiff's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.031" offset="8907525">It's then you say from the facts which the plaintiff has approved, it is their inference of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.933" offset="8927065">An inference never was created in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.297" offset="8936573">There was no overcoming an inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.987" offset="8943365">There was no rebutting an inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.430" offset="8949112">There was no -- the Court setting itself in -- in place of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.843" offset="8962696">An inference never arose because the plaintiff himself in his own case established at the conclusion of his case the reason for the emergency stop which was a non-negligence stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.281" offset="9008462">Now then, this question of is an emergency stop a -- an unusual thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.999" offset="9043362">In that regard and I want to be accurate and I'll try to follow my notes regarding the emergency stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.440" offset="9073142">The plaintiff testified in this record that a railroad had to expect emergency stops, page 37.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.204" offset="9092159">That he had to think about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.563" offset="9101667">The record shows on the deposition just a few days before trial that the plaintiff told me that he himself personally had experienced while riding in a caboose many times when there was an emergency stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.954" offset="9155166">His particular testimony at that is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.824" offset="9178676">I said, “Have you ever been in a caboose before when there was an emergency application of steam?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.661" offset="9198007">He says, "Many times."</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.387" offset="9204903">"Was there anything different about this time?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.711" offset="9214203">“Emergency of air you mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.159" offset="9220054">I have said emergency of steam and air?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.076" offset="9227682">And I said, “Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.921" offset="9231026">And he said “Many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.647" offset="9237922">I've seen the tracks jump out.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.675" offset="9246072">And I say, “And you have had that happen to you many times?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.805" offset="9258611">“I am very much alert to expecting that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.910" offset="9271045">Now this was his -- his deposition a week before the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2371.774" offset="9590471">There -- there is a statement and that there were two questions asked to Mr. Herdman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.238" offset="9604368">“Is there any other way to stop the train?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.564" offset="9609592">He says, “By service application.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.133" offset="9615862">“What does that mean?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.694" offset="9618160">“Well, that gradually let's off the air, but that's all.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.347" offset="9628714">There's no statement that confront with emergency with a 150 feet of track ahead of you and a carload of school children on the car that an emergency application can be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.175" offset="9664031">There's no evidence to support any that there's any other means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.072" offset="9675630">In fact, emergency is emergency as Mr. Herdman says that he's experienced it many times that he knew of it for many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.733" offset="9706350">He says that the conductor himself, he has a conductor riding that can pull emergency stop for instance if I had the reason or if it was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.213" offset="9744175">“I can pull the air,” he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.861" offset="9750862">Now, this is in the regular operation of a railroad that an emergency stop can be made by the conductor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.357" offset="9772805">Anyone on the statement, the regular operation of a freight train and this is testimony that the engineman, the engineer can make emergency stops for a variety of reasons, if the trail line brakes at air plus or if the engineer is faced with an emergency, which is precisely the situation here that it is an expected thing of railroading -- railroading men must experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.833" offset="9858696">He says that emergency stops are common knowledge, something we have to know about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.011" offset="9883460">And then he concluded, “You've got to expect them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.181" offset="9896103">So, this was an act that happens in the ordinary course of railroading that happens without the explanation of negligence or inference of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.959" offset="9935182">Now, if it please the Court, that is the total proof in this record to establish the three specific allegations of negligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2503.602" offset="10117831">But on the other hand, if you're going very slowly, the application of the air brakes even in slight manner not as an emergency but even in a just -- just throttling it down would -- would slow you down with practically no -- no shock at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.569" offset="10193690">Now, I notice in this -- in this statement that the train was going eight to ten miles an hour.</text>

            <text syncTime="2635.267" offset="10644459">Now, confronted with this total failure of proof, plaintiff made a motion for a directed verdict at the end of plaintiff's case and that was argued by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.689" offset="10690121">The Court held in our favor and granted the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.352" offset="10700779">An appeal was made to the Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.306" offset="10708616">Briefs were filed and it was unanimously determined to be the District Court's duty to have directed our verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.868" offset="10738813">Now, the two of the three specifications of negligence, negligence take place over negligence of operation, failure to warn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.552" offset="10777579">The plaintiff abandoned the first and third in the trial in the Circuit Court of Appeals and we understand this case here that they're abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.416" offset="10800985">He's talking not only about the negligent operation of the train which we suggest to Your Honors has been totally the fruit for which has been a total failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.700" offset="10838183">Confronted by this failure and the plaintiff knew he could not establish any negligence nor could he establish any of the three -- these three allegations of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.763" offset="10878412">The plaintiff in 1954, the complaint was filed in 1951, in 1954, late in the afternoon of the day before this case came to trial, he filed a minute complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.899" offset="10927000">And at that time, asserted language which he thought might lay a foundation for this res ipsa loquitur argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.356" offset="10952808">It was 100% a Johnny-come-lately idea by this -- by the plaintiff after he knew he had no case to establish negligence against the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.483" offset="10993351">Now, this document is res ipsa loquitur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.692" offset="11006098">The doctrine appears to be a substitute for the requirements on the part of a plaintiff to establish by clear and convincing proof the -- his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.659" offset="11054059">And because of that fact, this Court and many courts, many tax writers have given considerable attention to the question of res ipsa loquitur to still down the various propositions seem to require this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.391" offset="11108916">The various discussions of very res ipsa loquitur seem to require that before you can use res ipsa loquitur in the case, each of four basic conditions must be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.881" offset="11150921">First that the actual cause, the events complained of is not in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.681" offset="11170147">Two, that the plaintiff does not have knowledge of how the occurrence happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.253" offset="11188433">Three, that the accident is one which does not happened in the ordinary course of events unless they are failure to use due care and four, that the instrumentality causing the injury must be in the exclusive control of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.305" offset="11240573">Now, not only does the plaintiff's case failed to satisfy all four of these conditions, in truth, it failed to satisfy any one of the conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.878" offset="11278921">This first one regarding the first condition that the actual cause of the events complained of is not in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.466" offset="11305253">Now, this has been stated in different ways and different cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.424" offset="11317060">In Johnson against United States, 333, Justice Douglas, you made the statement that the rule deals only with permissible inferences from unexplained events.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.145" offset="11355930">And Justice Frankfurter, you said, “It is after all a rule of necessity to be invoked only when necessary evidence is absent and not readily available.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.436" offset="11405145">Now, I submit to this course -- Court that in this particular case, the actual cause of the event complained of, namely, the emergency stop is in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.883" offset="11442866">There is no question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.512" offset="11449448">It is in evidence in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.937" offset="11455091">It explains why the stop was made, namely, the emergency stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.650" offset="11477974">The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur as I suggested, is a fact in which permits an inference from proven facts, but it is an inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.892" offset="11510888">It is a doctrine which applies only at the completion of the whole case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.485" offset="11529279">It's at the end of the plaintiff's case that you say is there an inference of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.102" offset="11547773">And at the completion of this plaintiff's case, not at his testimony in chief but at all of his testimony, the question asked, “Can an inference be drawn of negligence at this time?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.509" offset="11589360">And in the record that's before Your Honor, you can't read the record without knowing the reason for the emergency stop that there was no negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.765" offset="11622484">Therefore, there could be no permissible inference and the case or there was a properly a directed verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.024" offset="11651427">Now, I have talked about this word of -- word about the proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.766" offset="11666474">Recall that it was this plaintiff's duty to -- to determine the cause of the stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.110" offset="11691760">Seconds after the stop, he started out this charge of that duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.045" offset="11707538">Three miles down the line, he did determined and he did file a report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.965" offset="11723212">That report is in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.381" offset="11728854">The counsel for the plaintiff suggested that Mr. Barton read the -- the report and it was marked for identification purposes as our exhibit and is in reference here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.004" offset="11771382">I have discussed the question of the -- the -- that this evidence is relevant even if there had been objection, there was no objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.372" offset="11800848">One objection was made to only one statement and no appeal has been taken from that and the -- the general testimony regarding the stop is in evidence without any objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.314" offset="11844629">And I will repeat again the plaintiff's suggestion that the -- the question you've asked, Mr. Chief Justice, about the stop not being necessary, I repeat that there is no evidence in this record that you might ask.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.667" offset="11898023">He also said, “Well -- well, could you stop a train by just letting off the (Inaudible) cause to stop of course you could.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.587" offset="11921742">Everyone knows there's a service application, but there's no evidence that in the facts confronting the engineer and fireman here, automobile on the tracks that a service application could have done the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.858" offset="11966777">There was no jury question presented, no testimony which would support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.685" offset="11982137">The plaintiff himself said that the use of emergency stop in emergency situations and -- and on that point, I think the Court might be interested in the testimony of Mr. Herdman, statements of Mr. Herdman which answered the res -- just that question and -- and answer this question that again this is his statement, a little salt here, made no lawyers off this track to the courtroom and here is Mr. Herdman's deposition when he has stated that he had talked to the engineer, the question was, “What did he tell you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.661" offset="12101987">Mr. Herdsman's answer - "He told me when I got off, he had a pickup, he set off and whatnot."</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.787" offset="12126542">That was, he had some cars to change after been going down three miles from the stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.696" offset="12142111">And I asked him, "What in the hell was he trying to do back there?</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.239" offset="12156322">Are you trying to kill us in the caboose?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.550" offset="12165622">He said, "No, Virg," he said, "I didn't give it a thought."</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.841" offset="12178787">I had -- there was a carload of school children, some kids in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.973" offset="12199267">He felt they might be school children who are going home or whatnot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.761" offset="12214418">And he said, “They skidded out on the tracks and stopped," and he said, "My God, it was you, to get you back there, take a chance on you or kill them kids."</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.083" offset="12251721">And he said, “That was the reason he done it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.585" offset="12265723">Now, I suggest that with any test of hearsay and I suggest within any question confronted with this emergency, this firemen and engineer did the one thing he could do, was stop this train.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.491" offset="12309295">Certainly, that doesn't imply negligence, in the inference of negligence which supports the claim under the FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.782" offset="12338552">The next part that I have lost track of my time but I -- I think I can keep track of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.284" offset="12356524">The second condition which must be shown is that the plaintiff does not have knowledge of the event.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.473" offset="12385259">This again has been stated in many ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.616" offset="12393827">What in here is perfectly clear that the plaintiff did know, plaintiff not only testified as to the report that he made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.095" offset="12419741">He testified in detail as to the validity of the report.</text>

            <text syncTime="3258.411" offset="13137063">I call the Court's attention, the statement of Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Boldt in another case in which he said, “It is common knowledge that trainmen -- among trainmen, that air brakes are applied in emergency, not frequently yet -- but yet commonly enough to be an incident of freight train operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.856" offset="13210833">Trainmen must expect the occasional necessity for such applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.449" offset="13229119">When they are made in order to protect life, it is the performance of a duty.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.702" offset="13250226">And I submit that that's exactly what we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.590" offset="13261720">The engineer stopped the train to protect life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.281" offset="13272482">It was a -- a performance of the duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.029" offset="13283453">And finally, if it please the Court, the fourth grounds for proving a res ipsa loquitur must be shown is that the instrumentality be in the control of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.860" offset="13326817">But the instrumentality here was an automobile sliding out in front of the train and striking the similar effect that was presented in Smith against the (Inaudible) in which this Court denies certiorari in 346.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.975" offset="13371225">Their train was involved by a tractor trailer at a great crossing, and the plaintiff's fireman was killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.973" offset="13395257">The Circuit Court of Appeals said the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur has no application to the facts in this case for the reason that the tractor trailer which collided with the locomotive was not under the control of the appellee, just as the automobile was not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.009" offset="13455444">Now, I would like to say to the Court that there is no confusion in this record as to where this accident took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.431" offset="13477073">This accident happened on a regular schedule run from Richmond to Columbus as the train came in riding through Dayton, Ohio in a closely built up residential section as an automobile drove out, come to, and in front of this train.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.855" offset="13526810">Now, the counsel for plaintiff suggested in his argument, he suggest that every page in his brief or reply brief that this happened within the limits of the Dayton yards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.850" offset="13566725">There is that statement, but plaintiff knows that the Dayton yards is an administrative decision for a maintenance section on the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.603" offset="13597759">The fact show that this was on the mainline, that this was not a switching yard situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.335" offset="13616671">This was not a classification yard situation where the railroad controls the whole area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.830" offset="13634644">And if it has to make an emergency stop because someone got on the tracks then it is their own fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.834" offset="13654706">Here, it was at a great crossing and the train on the mainline, so they have no control over this particular great crossing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.266" offset="13688456">Finally, I suggest that because the -- not only has the plaintiff not shown all four conditions they must show, he has not been able to show any one of the four that this was not a proper case for res ipsa loquitur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.047" offset="13739551">I also would like to suggest the Court that there is no conflict in the district in the disregard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.802" offset="13758568">Just this past month, this Court in Number 361, (Inaudible) against Northwestern refused certiorari in a case in their own county where the Court had granted a directed verdict in an FELA case at the completion of the plaintiff's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.794" offset="13806529">The various Circuits have required these four basic conditions and plaintiff is not satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.055" offset="13827636">And therefore, we suggest it and -- and probably even more important is that there never was and in our judgment never will be another Herdman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.341" offset="13860760">You can't disassociate a res ipsa loquitur case from the facts to the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.365" offset="13880822">And in this case, we have a conductor charged with responsibility and finds out and goes in the record the cause of the accident certainly there is no conflict with any of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.618" offset="13921886">Finally, I would like to suggest that the FELA is not a workmen's compensation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.851" offset="13942784">Now, there have been numerous members of this bench that have suggested it might be well for Congress to -- to pass the workmen's compensation law for railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.710" offset="13970160">With that proposition, we certainly do not have -- deny or question or disagree what Congress does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.873" offset="14002866">The FELA remains an Act based entirely on negligence and negligence must be shown is not presumed and was not shown in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.384" offset="14040900">And finally, and I have just lived through the shortest 30 minutes of my life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.876" offset="14058872">I would like to call the Court's attention that on page number -- on point number three of our brief, we call the attention to the sound, the judicial discretion which should properly be accorded trial judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.877" offset="14106833">And I would like to suggest the Court in the trial of these cases, we have found occasionally when a motion for directed verdict is made that the trial judge is implying to reserve his opinion and let their defendant put in his case and then when it's renewed he again reserves his opinion and judgment on the motion until the matter has been submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.395" offset="14184991">We often suspect that maybe it is designed to -- to hope that the jury might protect the judge and require to make the -- it's his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.080" offset="14215711">I would like to say that it is refreshing indeed to see the evidence of a really courageous, straightforward, direct piece of judicial statements here and a Court approved a -- a motion for directed verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.005" offset="14271404">That was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.692" offset="14278092">The Circuit Court of Appeals has affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.534" offset="14285511">We resolutely and respectfully submit to this Court from that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.681" offset="14302124">May I have --</text>

            <text syncTime="3553.951" offset="14319156">-- very quickly, this record that they introduced is not plaintiff's evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.930" offset="14339114">It was marked defendant's exhibit and introduced in the cross-examination that it is not plaintiff's evidence which destroys the possibility of the application of res ipsa.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.497" offset="14389373">He said that he discussed the matter of a 150 feet of track or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.488" offset="14417272">He is bringing matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.369" offset="14420825">I don't know where he got them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.560" offset="14425631">There isn't anything in the record in an effort to pervert the attention of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.156" offset="14447992">Depositions are improperly used here and I would like for you to know, I will not take the time but if you knew what the engineer had to say, you would then understand why the engineer was not called to testify, why he was not made plaintiff's witness whom we could not impeach from the story.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.702" offset="14530226">He told the story is absolutely contradictory to the evidence that has been read here from a deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.640" offset="14553945">Now, it said, “Defendant's explanations may preclude recovery,” and that is exactly correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.346" offset="14576724">We do not say that we are entitled to recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.090" offset="14587695">We say that the duty, the violation of a duty and the evidence is here to permit an inference of negligence that should be decided by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.806" offset="14626565">The judge should not say that it was rebutted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.090" offset="14647777">In this case, there was no collision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.329" offset="14656658">He cited two cases that the Court said, had previously said where there was a collision with an automobile, everything wasn't in exclusive control of the defendant.</text>
