            <label>Mr. David Rein</label>
            <text syncTime="15.488" offset="61858">Thank you Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.550" offset="74188">This is an action to review and set aside a deportation order entered against the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.026" offset="104072">The petitioner here is an alien, a native of Germany.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.506" offset="126015">He is 73 years of age and he has resided in the United States since 1940 at which time he entered permanent residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.855" offset="167393">He has lived here in other words for a period of about 43, 44 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.390" offset="189544">He applied for citizenship in 1942, but citizenship was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.902" offset="219533">The deportation order here is based upon the statute Section 22 of the Internal Security Act which was enacted in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.444" offset="265718">This section provides for the deportation of aliens who were at any time in the past members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.923" offset="307618">The order here was based upon a finding by the Immigration and Naturalization Service that the petitioner had been a member of the Communist Party for about six months in the year 1935, that's 15 years before the passage of the act which authorized his deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.566" offset="386194">The finding of the Immigration Service in this case rests entirely upon a statement which was made by petitioner under oath to a representative of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.720" offset="442828">That statement is set out substantial in full in our brief appearing at pages 4 to page 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.241" offset="476891">I wish to direct the Court's attention at this time to certain portions of that statement which we believe are the more significant portions bearing upon the issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.797" offset="527151">Reading from page 5 of our brief a question was put to the petitioner, “What was purpose of your joining the Communist Party?”</text>
            <text syncTime="140.861" offset="563409">Answer, “The purpose was probably this, it seemed to me that it came hand in hand, the Communist Party and the fight for bread.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.968" offset="603847">It seemed to me like this; let's put it this way that the Communist Party and Workers alliance had one aim -- to get something to eat for the people.”</text>
            <text syncTime="161.914" offset="647628">On the same theme at page 10 of our brief toward the end of the statement, the question was again put to the petitioner, “Again referring to your joining the Communist Party in 1935 was this motivated by the satisfaction and living under a democracy?”</text>
            <text syncTime="181.445" offset="725682">Answer, “No, not by that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="184.108" offset="736340">“Just a matter of having no jobs at that time, everybody around me had the idea that we had to fight for something to eat and cloths and shelter.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.563" offset="782211">We were not thinking then -- anyways the fellows around me of overthrowing anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.045" offset="804153">We wanted something to eat and something to crawl into.”</text>
            <text syncTime="204.892" offset="819513">Question, “You say fight for something to eat and crawl into.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.808" offset="835187">What do you mean by that term?”</text>
            <text syncTime="210.438" offset="841665">Answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.111" offset="848353">“We had to go and ask those who had it -- that was the courthouse at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.184" offset="868728">We petitioned city, state and national government.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.544" offset="882103">We did and we succeeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.640" offset="890462">We finally got unemployment laws and a certain budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.470" offset="905822">Even at the few communist meetings I attended, nothing was ever said about overthrowing anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.900" offset="931527">All they talked about was fighting for the daily needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.524" offset="946051">That is why we never thought much of joining those parties in those days.”</text>
            <text syncTime="242.349" offset="969352">The statement also contains statement of the petitioner's beliefs in which he stated that he did not, never had believed in the advocacy or the overthrow of the government by force and also a statement of his own question of philosophy which I think that without going into any further detail, can certainly be characterized as an individualistic philosophy.</text>

            <text syncTime="474.639" offset="1898475">As we read Galvan, this was not equivalent to being an involuntary or unconscious member that concededly we raise no point about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="554.245" offset="2216960">I should clarify that when I say the laws that existed with regard to members of organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.939" offset="2243709">In other words, prior to 1950 there had been no statute providing for the deportation of a member of the Communist Party.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Rein</label>
            <text syncTime="672.071" offset="2688209">Yes, Galvan says that expressly.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.885" offset="2695523">As a matter of fact it says that in examining the debates of 1951 amendment, particularly the reference in the Congressional debates for the opinion of Colyer against Skeffington, Galvan expressly says that Congress are meant to exclude other categories from the class of membership or to include them with a nominal membership other than these three specific categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.827" offset="2799282">That's the -- that's an express statement in Galvan.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.847" offset="2815373">If I may say, it's on page 20 of my brief quoting from page 5 to 7 of Galvan, “Congress did not provide that the three types of situations that enumerated and the 1951 corrective statute should be the only instances where membership is so nominal as to keep an alien out of the deportable class.”</text>
            <text syncTime="724.927" offset="2899696">So we say that Galvan said that even if an individual did not fall into any of these three categories, he could still fall outside of the scope of the statute that these membership was of a nominal character.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.991" offset="2947866">And indeed that doctrine of Galvan finds support in the debates.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.420" offset="2981616">We have set out in our supplemental reply brief of a language used by Senator Ferguson in the course of the debate on the Senate floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.001" offset="3023935">Now Senator Ferguson's comments are particularly appropriate here because he was the mover of the amendment in the form in which it was finally adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.878" offset="3071478">I should say that the time in 1951 clarifying amendment was first brought in by Senator McCarran on behalf of the Judiciary Committee, it provided that it would apply only to members of so called fascist organizations and do not provide this clarification or exception for members of allegedly communist organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.929" offset="3159667">Senator Ferguson moved to amend that clarifying provision so that it would cover members of communist organizations as well as fascist organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.521" offset="3198015">That amendment was adopted and it was passed in that form.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.962" offset="3211807">So Senator Ferguson is really the author of the amendment in the form in which it passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.952" offset="3231765">We have set out two quotes from him in the debate and it is clear he says, that his understanding of the amendment is that it would exclude all those who are communists by conviction what we call mentally communists, but it would not exclude those who really in effect never have been what I call mentally communists and he goes on and repeats himself at a later portion of the Congressional record.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.616" offset="3334374">Also is significant, and I think this is of great significance here, is that Congress itself said that the meaning to be used in members here is to be found in the way it's been interpreted in the courts in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.532" offset="3402083">And they refer to one case as the chief source, as a matter of fact, it's the only case I know of which really discussed this problem, when one could be a member of a the Communist Party but on his relationship was still so nominal as to keep him without the scope of the statute and that is the District Court case of Colyer against Skeffington.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.120" offset="3488392">The Congressional memorandum quoted approvingly from that case and so did Galvan.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.522" offset="3510021">We have set out again in our supplemental reply brief other quotations from that case, which I think especially are in force with this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.265" offset="3548996">At page 3 for example, Colyer against Skeffington indicated and in fact set aside deportation orders and I am reading from page 3 of my supplemental reply brief, when I say the ‘reply brief' on re-argument in which the Court said, “Social, educational purposes and race sympathy rather than political agitation constituted the controlling motive with a large share of them,” that is aliens ordered deported on grounds of membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.695" offset="3678772">“They join the local Russian and Polish or Lithuanian socialist or communist club, just as citizens join neighborhood clubs, social or religious or civic or fraternal.”</text>
            <text syncTime="931.865" offset="3727360">The Court then in two other cases, this case involved a member of separate cases, which were being all reviewed in one decision in Colyer against Skeffington.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.384" offset="3777515">One of the cases significantly show that the sole evidence against the alien there was that he had paid dues to the Communist Party for three months.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.233" offset="3816908">The Court held that that was insufficient proof to show that character of membership to fall within the statute and it set aside the deportation order in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1367.861" offset="5471399">The questions addressed to him and which he answered were answered in 1947 and he was asked about what he might have known about Marxist classics or Lenin, and I might say that whatever he did know about them showed that he knew the names of these, certainly his views were different, but there is no evidence that his knowledge at that time, his knowledge at that time that he might have had in 1947 was knowledge he possessed in 1935.</text>

            <text syncTime="1402.702" offset="5610789">That is correct, and as a matter of fact the statement of the petitioner where he discusses these Marxist classics, he states his disagreement with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.573" offset="5646211">And as a matter of fact to one question he was asked about his opinion of the Communist Party to which he is answer is the Communist Party since I have known of them, there is no basis to assume that any knowledge he has of -- was current to 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.452" offset="5709740">As a matter of fact the fair inference of the statement is that it was since 1935, remember the statement was made in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.791" offset="5739102">Also I think and one factor which Your Honor has left out in considering the question of whether he was a nominal member or not, his own statement as to why he joined the Communist Party and what his interest was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.147" offset="5792496">He stated that his interest was not a political interest, but that he had a very limited interest in joining the party and that was the struggle for bread.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.955" offset="5827814">Now I think that has to be taken into account similarly as Judge Anderson took into the account the fact that the alien who joined the Communist Party was interested in a place where he could learn to read and write.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.684" offset="5874730">So I think gathering all those factors together, the membership here was certainly of a character that can only be described as nominal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1495.010" offset="5979951">That's correct and I think that was the inquiry adopted in Carlo against Anderson and that seems to be what's in the back of -- clearly if anything is in the back of Senator Ferguson's mind and we must assume there was, he uses the phrase that this amendment will not exclude those who were mentally communists or communists by conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.559" offset="6078171">In other words, Senator Ferguson would assume that someone who joined the Communist Party for reasons completely disassociated with politics, but for other very immediate reasons as in this case because of the fact that he was interested in an opportunity in a way of getting unemployment relief and his interest is his -- in this record was limited to that and never went any further that, that kind of membership is merely nominal membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.154" offset="6216516">We argue also that on the point raised earlier by Justice Harlan that he falls because of the reasons why he joined the Communist Party in his own statements, he falls within one specific exception as set forth in the 1951 Act, and that is that he joined for the purposes of obtaining the necessities of life.</text>

            <text syncTime="1610.090" offset="6440333">We say in addition to that, however, that even if the Court would disagree with us and say that it was, it's not the function of this Court to make that finding in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.652" offset="6486518">I think one thing that is perfectly clear, it's perfectly clear from the record here, the findings made by the immigration service and indeed even by the argument still presented by the government here that the concept of nominal membership is really never permeated the immigration service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.463" offset="6553809">They equated with voluntary and conscious membership, and so long as the fact that remains and the record shows that the individual was alive and awake at the time he joined that is enough for them and that is all they found in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.655" offset="6614518">But if that therefore at a minimum, even if the Court thinks that there was sufficient evidence here and we think there was not for the reasons set out in our brief, it is not for this Court to make the original determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.322" offset="6673241">We have cited authorities to that effect, I think the Securities Exchange Commission against Chenery and two Labor Board cases indicating that where a finding from an administrative agency comes before this Court and is based upon insufficient -- is based upon inadequate grounds, illegal grounds this Court's function is to set it aside and set it back and not to make an original determination as to how the service could have come out if it had used of the proper standings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.398" offset="6797584">It's also conceivable that if the case went back to the service it might have a better record, I think as Justice Frankfurter has said, the record here is a very bare one, and perhaps it might have better Act in which the issue can be explored on both sides as to the character of the petitioner's membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.528" offset="6914090">As I say we think the petitioner here also belongs within specific exception because of the fact that under the facts here it is clear that he joined to obtain the necessities of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.625" offset="6958498">Also and this is language in Galvan, but which comes out of Senator McCarran's quotation from Colyer against Skeffington is that an alien who joins an organization but who has no real knowledge of any of its platforms and purposes and is not aware that it has a distinct and active political organization, falls in the character of a nominal membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.096" offset="7068317">In that connection we like to indicate what seems to us the significant language in this record in which the petitioner in being asked why he joined the Communist Party said all they talked about was fighting for the daily needs, that is why we never thought much of joining those parties in those days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.963" offset="7147833">Now whether he meant to include the Communist Party and the other types of parties or the Communist Party and the Workers Alliance, it's perfectly clear from the meaning of that statement and I think it can lead only one inference that he was not joining this organization and thereby adhering to a set of political ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.264" offset="7229022">What he was doing was joining an organization which could help them in gaining the relief at that present moment and not going beyond that, (Inaudible)</text>

            <text syncTime="1875.177" offset="7500696">The case was not heard by this Court because in the following term in October the service filed a memorandum with a suggestion of mootness, in which they asked that, that case be sent back to them, because of the language in Galvan, they could consider whether or not that alien was a nominal member.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.597" offset="7586377">Now I don't know what they ever did with that case at all, but I have seen no decision of the immigration service in which there was any discussion as to whether or not a person is or is not a nominal member.</text>

            <text syncTime="1935.693" offset="7742694">I think the initial problem we have on that is the question as to whether or not deportation statutes are or not subject to Constitutional limitations and are or not subject to judicial review, under either the due process clause, the First Amendment or other provisions of the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.028" offset="7824091">The last time that this case was argued before this Court, our chief complaint against Galvan, was that we thought that it held that there was no judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.043" offset="7868082">I thought that after that argument was completed that all sides including the government apparently had conceded that statutes, deportation statutes could be tested as to whether or not they were in conflict with due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.894" offset="7927536">The government has since filed a supplemental brief, however, in which they now retain to the more extreme position, the most extreme position and that is that a deportation statute having been passed by Congress is entirely immune from judicial review at all, for any purposes or any reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="2000.637" offset="8002456">Substantive due process, that's correct or so far as I can see of any other position of the Constitution, that as a matter of law they say entirely within the political discretion of Congress and cannot be reviewed for Congress -- by this Court on any basis or ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.997" offset="8067971">The argument that presents on behalf of that theory seemed to fall into two categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.240" offset="8092944">The first one is the statement, that an alien having come here for residence, has no vested right to remain here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.360" offset="8137352">Since he has no vested right to remain here, presumably according to the government, his privilege of remaining here can be taken away from him for any reason, for no reason or for bad reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.612" offset="8194403">Now, I think that on the face of it that argument cannot stand up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.639" offset="8218540">Certainly the Constitution, and this Court has held repeatedly, protects people from the deprecation of privileges which do not fall in the category of vested rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.871" offset="8263471">We can give only a few examples and I think in the recent decisions of this Court, the Wieman and the Slochower cases in which what was involved was the privilege of government employment, there was certainly no vested right of government employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.770" offset="8327001">The Schware case decided by this Court last term involved what must be considered to be the privilege of becoming a member of the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.717" offset="8358766">There was a person who was not even a member of the bar and it was held that he could be denied the privilege of becoming a member of the bar, except on rational grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.854" offset="8407353">So that the concept of -- there is no vested right it seems to me, it does not meet the argument that the depravation of the privilege not be subject to ordinary Constitutional limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.595" offset="8458344">The second argument presented by the government is that deportation statutes are immune from judicial review because they are linked with foreign relations and I think that really seems to be the gist of their argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.409" offset="8537548">Now we say that, that notion in that Court is completely unrealistic, as related to the alien in this case or related with a great majority, the overwhelming majority of aliens in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.370" offset="8605466">I think it's common place to say that we are a nation of immigrant aliens, that aliens who come into this country, come in as immigrant aliens, with the notion of living here for the rest of their lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.788" offset="8659069">The government's brief seems to depend on a theory of dealing with a class of people who have come here for a very transitory purpose, as though they are flitting in and out, that talks about people as being a temporary guest, as though they were visit in someone's house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.140" offset="8728555">Now that's certainly not potential.</text>

            <text syncTime="3155.472" offset="12621845">Mr. Chief justice, may it please the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.332" offset="12641280">As Mr. Rein has indicated, this case presents two issues, one which is a relatively narrow issue of whether Rowoldt, the petitioner's membership in the Communist Party was of the type which the statute makes deportable, past membership in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.965" offset="12719856">The second which is a much broader issue is the issue of the validity of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.041" offset="12744098">Mr. Rein has argued the second question, the validity of the statute, as if there has been no prior adjudication of this Court either on this particular issue or on the general issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.458" offset="12797806">As the Court knows the precise issue was considered and decided three years ago in a case of Galvan against Press and a very closely comparable issue was decided five years ago in the case of Harisiades against Shaughnessy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.925" offset="12863634">And as the opinions of the Court in those two cases indicate the opinions were rested upon a long line of decisions of this Court, beginning with the Chinese exclusion cases in 130 United States and stemming with relation to deportation from the case of Fong Yue Ting in 1893 in 149 U.S. For these reasons the government did not see fit last year or think it appropriate rather I should say to reargue extensively the issue of the validity of the statute, but since the case was set down for re-argument, we in our supplemental brief set forth the argument which we had made in the Harisiades and the Galvan of briefs putting them together in connected form, so that they would be available for the justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.993" offset="13067912">I do not propose in view of the decision of the Court in the Galvan and Harisiades case to re-argue extensively the constitutionality of the statute unless some of the justices should be desirous that I do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.707" offset="13126740">But I would point out in answer to statements that Mr. Rein made, that nowhere in our brief or in our position, either in Harisiades or in Galvan, did we take the possession that there was absolutely no review whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.762" offset="13182955">We followed the view which we think the Court adopted in those cases, that you have to say that the Congressional determination was a fantasy or a pretense, before you could invalidate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.081" offset="13232274">We did not take the position, which I may say that Judges Learned Hand, Augustus Hand and Swan in the Second Circuit decision in the Harisiades case said was well supported on principal and authority, that is the position that there was an absolute authority of Congress to pass deportation legislation, but this Court did not seek -- find it necessary to take that position in Harisiades or in Galvan and we have not done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.423" offset="13341675">Now on the first issue of the membership of Rowoldt in the Communist Party, I think before I go on to that if the Court would pardon me, it's appropriate to say that there are five cases pending on the Court's docket which raise the issue of the validity of this statute, four of them are pending on petition for certiorari and one of them is a case in which the writ has already been granted, and that issue is collaterally involved, so that the issue is before Your Honors not only in this case but in other cases which are on the Court's docket.</text>

            <text syncTime="3369.297" offset="13477094">Constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.741" offset="13486916">The other cases, not all, but some of the other cases raise also the question of nominal membership, but there are five cases which definitively raise the question of the constitutionality of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.635" offset="13558491">And turning to the question of the membership of Rowoldt in the Communist Party in 1935, the first thing perhaps for me to say is that this is an administrative procedure -- proceeding in which there was a hearing before an Inquiry Officer and appeal to the Assistant Commissioner of the Immigration Service, a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals, and in those circumstances the Court has long ago laid down the rule that it can reverse the finding of fact only if it finds that there was no evidence or unless it finds that there was not some evidence to support the finding of the administrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.791" offset="13695164">Justice Brandeis laid that down particularly in a case comparable to this and that was a case of a man who distributed pamphlets advocating the overthrow of the government, the case of Tisi against Tod in 264 United States, in which he said the issue is not whether the factual determination was correct or whether it would have been supported if it had made by a district court, but only whether there were some evidence to support the finding of the administrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.302" offset="13805192">And Mr. Justice Douglas for the Court followed the same rule in another case, a comparable case involving membership in the Communist Party, Bridges against Wixon in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.362" offset="13853362">So it's in that context we believe that the facts in this case have to be appraised.</text>

            <text syncTime="4589.843" offset="18359275">And they were -- the legislative history of that statute is replete with statements that they weren't trying to establish something new, that they were trying to go back to the law as they understood that it had been administered by the courts and the administrators since 1920.</text>
