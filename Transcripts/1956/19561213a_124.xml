            <label>Mr. Karl Riemer</label>
            <text syncTime="9.123" offset="139891">Okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.306" offset="156609">Your Honor, there is no -- Your Honors, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.802" offset="170611">There is no material factual difference between the -- Allen-Bradley case on this.The only material difference between the two cases that I can see is that my Brother Peters won and I lost below.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.417" offset="253053">I'd like to review this amortization program for a moment that came in, in 1940, when we were faced with an emergency and when American business and industry still had a depression psychology.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.123" offset="319822">Mr. Peters said that there was much responsible opinion to the effect that our physical plant was overbuilt at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.943" offset="359111">American business and industries were afraid of a post-war depression.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.524" offset="381471">That's why it did not want to invest its capital in new productive facilities, which it might not be able to make economic use of after the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.610" offset="429850">In those circumstances, Congress made a compact with business and industry that if they would build these facilities, that this cost could be amortized to give such profits as could be earned during the emergency period.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.554" offset="509576">Now, there had to be a cutoff date.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.242" offset="528384">Congress legislated in the summer of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.894" offset="542908">First, it said that no facility completed after July 10 could be treated -- could be treated as an emergency facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.693" offset="586167">Later, it pushed the date back, but it made this provision that to the extent that a facility has been completed after the critical day, it could be certified that amortization could apply to the cost attributable to construction after the critical date.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.445" offset="681148">That was one problem that the percentage certificates in the early days of the program saw.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.665" offset="714062">The second problem that those percentage certificates in the early days saw was this.As Undersecretary Patterson said in the report, which is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.527" offset="761501">In the early days, there was difficulty in determining especially where a facility had been begun before the Blitzkrieg broke loose, whether it was really designed for defense or for -- for facility -- for civilian purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.790" offset="838510">So in those early days, if the certifying agencies decided that 30% of the facility was for defense and 70% was for civilian use, they issued a certificate of 30% of cost up to 30% of cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.450" offset="917191">Now, taxpayers who got those certificates have no complaints because limiting amortization to 30% of cost of a facility that is only 30% necessary is only a practical and convenient means of reflecting the determination of necessity made by the certifying agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.219" offset="1016247">Now, that leads me to what the certifying agencies did in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.929" offset="1047071">First, I think the record can leave no doubt that they found as to each of these facilities that they were necessary in the interest of national defense, period.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.301" offset="1096600">Those are the statutory words.</text>

            <label>Justice Stanley Reed</label>
            <text syncTime="250.936" offset="1107153">Hundred -- hundred percent?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="karl_riemer" startTime="252.850" stopTime="1077.355">
            <label>Mr. Karl Riemer</label>
            <text syncTime="252.850" offset="1114781">Well, necessary in the interest of national defense, Mr. Justice Reed.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.906" offset="1139022">Period.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.983" offset="1143306">I don't think you can express that in terms of percentage.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.898" offset="1158980">You can say that a facility is half necessary, that is half of it is necessary, but that's something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.672" offset="1194088">They found first that these facilities were necessary in the interest of national defense and that's what Congress told them to find.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.219" offset="1236198">They found also, as to the facilities which are involved in these cases before you that it was to the advantage of the Government that the facilities be privately financed.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.431" offset="1289070">Now, I don't quarrel with the fact that the War Production Board undertook to determine that, to make a decision as to that.But there's not a word in the statute which imposes a duty upon them to make that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.663" offset="1370049">They made it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.694" offset="1378200">They also found in respect of each of the facilities that's before this Court that the facility had postwar utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.917" offset="1426996">Now, assuming that that's something that's easy to decide or can be decided at all in the midst of a war.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.106" offset="1463777">Assuming that, there's nevertheless, not a word in the statute that lays that function of making a decision on that point to the certifying agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.028" offset="1515499">Fourth, the certifying agencies found in respect of the facilities that are here involved that the difference between normal peacetime cost of these facilities and their cost during the war was X percent, 35 in this case, 80 in another and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.055" offset="1599613">That is the amount that the War Production Board tried to limit our amortization to and the record shows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.453" offset="1641200">It shows that the certificates were limited as to percentage of cost only because they were determined to have postwar utility and that they had excess war cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.959" offset="1699192">There was no qualification of the necessity, whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.645" offset="1725942">Now, I'd like to pass to another point that is obviously of interest to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.965" offset="1751228">Why are we here in 1956?</text>
            <text syncTime="416.079" offset="1767737">In the first place, the War Production Board and its predecessor agencies had no protest system.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.694" offset="1806190">As a practical matter, all of us who were here during the war know this.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.135" offset="1827924">You couldn't take up your time protesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.284" offset="1840462">It was futile anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.851" offset="1850807">Second, Congress set up no provision for review of determinations of necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.497" offset="1885393">Much less did it set up a provision for review of determinations of excess war cost and postwar utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.831" offset="1922696">There was no review available within the administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.649" offset="1949968">Second, in 1947, the United States Graphite Company went to the District Court in the District of Columbia where they petitioned for mandamus to the Secretary of Commerce, the -- the successor to the WPB to correct a certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.533" offset="2041501">Now, that wasn't very long delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.322" offset="2056652">The District Court of the District of Columbia decided no mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.121" offset="2075878">Mandamus will not lie to correct administrative discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.991" offset="2103359">We think that's good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.748" offset="2110360">The Government thinks that's good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.696" offset="2118196">With all due respect, Mr. Justice Harlan, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals said mandamus would lie if there was an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.539" offset="2161560">That's where we quarrel with that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.059" offset="2187577">The taxpayer, U.S. Graphite, appealed that decision to the Court of Appeals, the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.525" offset="2221432">It lost by a divided Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.390" offset="2236897">It sought a petition for certiorari here and that was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.115" offset="2255809">That occurred in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.785" offset="2270542">Now, since the courts over the country generally do not have jurisdiction over mandamus against a federal administrative agency, since you can only bring such a case here in the District of Columbia, taxpayers generally know it was futile to seek mandamus to correct these errors in 1949 and from thereon.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.152" offset="2387989">The same taxpayer, then called the Wickes Corporation went to the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.887" offset="2414947">The Court of Claims was convinced that even if mandamus didn't lie to correct an error and we say that's right because there might be a reasonable basis for what the administrator did in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.894" offset="2479000">Nevertheless, what the administrative did was wrong and therefore, the Court of Claims granted relief to the Wickes Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.206" offset="2520168">At that point, the question came up, should the Government ask this Court to review?</text>
            <text syncTime="610.583" offset="2545664">The Government did not ask this Court to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.017" offset="2563427">At that point, it seems to me that taxpayers generally could have assumed that the tax question had been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.824" offset="2606686">The next defense of interest is that the National Lead Company Case, which incidentally are involved in many other issues was scheduled for trial in the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.291" offset="2656528">Just before the trial, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue announced that he would not follow the Wickes decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.761" offset="2694457">So as far as National Lead is concerned, we had to go to the Tax Court with it or let it drop forever because our hearing would soon be over and we would have no way to contest to change the tax liability for the years here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.691" offset="2790170">Now, Mr. Zarky has read to you the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.056" offset="2815561">Perhaps it is not the best legislative draftsmanship, but I don't have too much trouble with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.189" offset="2860178">There shall be included only so much of the amount otherwise, constituting such adjusted basis as is properly attributable to such construction as -- as either the Secretary or the -- or -- or the Secretary of the Navy has certified, as is attributable to such construction as has been certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.211" offset="3012211">Mr. Zarky wants you to read that as though that properly attributable clause were not in there as though the statute said there shall be included only such -- so much of the amount as either the Secretary of War or the Secretary of the Navy has certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.659" offset="3097997">I say that is a misreading of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.771" offset="3126418">I come also to this question of partial certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.785" offset="3150555">Of course, the certifying agencies had power to certify parts of facilities and they did certify parts of facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.150" offset="3196008">And that power comes not from the section, which we are discussing, subsection f(1), but from the very definition of an emergency facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.376" offset="3260897">That term according to the statute means any facility, land, building, machinery, equipment or part of their armory, which either Secretary has certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.150" offset="3319933">Now, I can't think of any problem of partial certification of any facility, which is only partly physically necessary to the national defense, which couldn't be certified under that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.744" offset="3386389">50% of a factory, that's all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.421" offset="3401017">One production line instead of another, that's all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.782" offset="3418467">Part of a facility could be certified, but this authority to certify a part does not come from the so called "only so much clause" of Subsection f(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="846.016" offset="3487431">The Commissioner dismissed it, almost through the wave of a hand the immensely difficult problem of postwar use.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.137" offset="3539884">We had an amortization law under -- in World War I.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.406" offset="3557021">That is three months after the war had ended, Congress passed a provision providing or allowing reasonable deductions for the amortization of facilities paid for by the taxpayer and used in war production.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.449" offset="3641135">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that it would be reasonable to allow as such a deduction, the difference between cost and value in use after the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.869" offset="3702888">Now, that's a logical enough concept, but it created endless practical difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.755" offset="3730369">It was one of the principal subjects, which interested the famous Customs Committee investigating the Bureau of Internal Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.430" offset="3777076">It was a difficult problem and Congress knew it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.906" offset="3795048">Congress knew in 1940 that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.867" offset="3810826">It meant to avoid those difficulties and it did avoid those difficulties by leaving the problems of postwar use and excess war cost out of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.354" offset="3864743">The Commissioner says the problems of the World War I Law were solved by fixing the period, the five-year period or less.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.251" offset="3908420">The one thing that was sure about the World War I Law was the period because the war was already over when Congress acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.112" offset="3967770">Now, whether the War Production Board was wise or unwise in injecting into this amortization scheme, these problems of postwar utility and excess war cost, these are factors requiring a degree of clairvoyance.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.092" offset="4043734">That's not the issue here whether they were wise or unwise by standards that we might apply today.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.960" offset="4079261">The issue here is the -- the issue of power of an administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.473" offset="4105279">That experience has shown that a statute should have been more comprehensive is no wants for extending it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.430" offset="4145089">I come to the principle which in the last analysis, the supposed principle, which in the last analysis must give the Commissioner his chief support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.541" offset="4205484">He cannot find a word in the statute to indicate that Congress was concerned with cost or with postwar utility or with excess war cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.979" offset="4259297">The precise language of the statute and the illuminating legislative history belie that possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.092" offset="4287718">They make the Commissioner's position untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.060" offset="4303600">So, he espouses what we regard as a novel and dangerous doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.459" offset="4333171">He said that the power of an administrative agency is to be measured not by what Congress granted it but by what Congress didn't say it could do or didn't say it couldn't do.</text>

            <text syncTime="1127.203" offset="4612159">I want to say this about the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.126" offset="4623862">There has never been -- I should say -- there never was a regulation of the War Department, of the Navy Department or of the WPB which referred by so much as one word to the matter of excess war cost, postwar utility which are the only reasons why there was a limitation on these certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.361" offset="4732844">There was no published regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.566" offset="4745592">It was internal policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.809" offset="4754578">I don't think the world whether it knew or not was bound by that internal policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.274" offset="4788433">That most the regulations did was say in the latter day that no certificate would be granted unless it was found to the advantage of the Government to have them privately commence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.697" offset="4874115">Now, Mr. Justice Harlan, as to the decision of the Second Circuit, the Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit, in the first place, I think the court below, with due respect, misinterpreted the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.763" offset="4966379">Perhaps, that was my fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.587" offset="4977768">I don't think the Court understood that there was in fact in this record and if not so clear in the record in the clear understanding of the parties, the determination by the WPB that these facilities were necessary, period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.466" offset="5065226">And that the limitation of -- was bottomed only on the determinations as to excess war cost and postwar utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.365" offset="5124786">I have no doubt, but that Court was impressed and I am sometimes ashamed of the time it takes to dispose of tax controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.061" offset="5183613">But that question wasn't raised until the Commissioner filed his brief in the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.870" offset="5226872">It was -- the question wasn't, in brief, for the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.143" offset="5247979">We have no opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.139" offset="5259891">We tried hard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.555" offset="5261563">We made a motion for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.707" offset="5270235">We tried hard to explain to the Court that there was no undue delay here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.914" offset="5299075">That there was no opportunity to protest to the WPB that there was no system of review or appeal of WPB decisions, that mandamus had been sought in the District of Columbia and that the District of Columbia's Court said, “Mandamus will not lie to control administrative discretion, which we think is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.903" offset="5419029">If the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit thought that there was any real doubt that there was a finding that these facilities were necessary, just as necessary as any aluminum plant built early in the war, there can't be any doubt of it involved bearing factory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.315" offset="5516622">I don't care when you build it, was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.410" offset="5533027">The limitations were attributable to other policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.777" offset="5554448">I say if the Court up there had any real doubt as to what the fact was as to the finding made by the WPB, it should have sent the case back to the Tax Court for findings on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.808" offset="5638562">We asked them to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.858" offset="5646817">They refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.167" offset="5652041">We would still ask this Court to remand if there is doubt, if there can be doubt, we say there can be none in the face of the record that there was a finding of necessity and that the subsidiary findings were due to other unrelated policies whether wise or unwise.</text>

            <text syncTime="1563.678" offset="6358079">If the Court please -- I -- I think that at least enclosed in the knob of the controversy between the parties here, must be a determination of what the -- what War Production Board did and what it didn't do and we can't reach the illegal questions until we first find out what the facts are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.757" offset="6446373">National Lead says that the War Production Board determined that these facilities were necessary in the interest of the national defense, period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.940" offset="6487124">Allen-Bradley says that we admitted that these facilities were necessary in the interest of the national defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.535" offset="6521501">I think neither statement can be accepted as correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.607" offset="6545847">The best place to find this is in the record and if the Court will bear with me, let me read from pages 12 and 13 of the record in National Lead and they say this consists of an affidavit given by the Chief of the Tax Amortization branch and this affidavit has been used in all these cases beginning way back with the case in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.018" offset="6639470">So, these are the facts which all the taxpayers have accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.139" offset="6663920">The first question is what was going on in 1943?</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.617" offset="6693804">And here's what the affidavit says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.166" offset="6708015">We are entering into a face of total wealth -- wealth warfare under which our materials and manpower went short supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.849" offset="6738735">It would seem no investment of capital should be made unless it was fairly necessary, goes down to say would increase tax rate, necessity certificates had become attracted, but the cost of Government was a real sacrifice with -- to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.393" offset="6804982">And for these reasons, the matter was reexamined and submitted for policy considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.894" offset="6842911">Now, on pages 14, the affidavit said and this is after the policy decision had been laid at paragraph 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.920" offset="6879065">I-- I'm sorry, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.862" offset="6882826">I got the wrong page.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.165" offset="6904038">On page 15, he describes the war production policy as being one where certificates would not be issued unless they were in the interest of the national defense and the Government's financial risk was being safeguarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.785" offset="6982510">Now, what the War Production Board then did, then becomes clear when we take this memorandum of instructions issued for its personnel and the standard was the war production set for its own guidance as to what it would do in future cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1793.193" offset="7276126">Let me make it clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.052" offset="7279574">Let's say here, the Act that comes in says, “We want to construct factory, extra business so and so.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.315" offset="7304652">The first question is “Do we need a factory of that type?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.888" offset="7322937">And let us assume the War Production Board said, “Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.088" offset="7331715">This kind of factory is essential.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.922" offset="7347075">But that's not all that the War Production had to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.308" offset="7360554">It had to decide, “Do we want to construct it by this taxpayer or do we want it construct by the Government?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.040" offset="7391483">If it's constructed by the Government, it may be at a considerable saving.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.822" offset="7410709">If it's constructed by this taxpayer, it may affect our whole economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.879" offset="7426905">It's not just a question of cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.027" offset="7435473">It's the questions of price control, in which the tax rate played a heavy role.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.957" offset="7455222">Questions of the sacrifice of materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.698" offset="7462118">Is this particular taxpayer better equipped than somebody else to do the same thing or the same kind of factory?</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.588" offset="7485733">There was a host of problems, which the War Production Board had to decide in its own mind before it could come to the particular decision with respect to a particular taxpayer whether a particular certificate would be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.100" offset="7543724">So that one of the elements, among many if they had to take into account was this element of what will it cost the Government?</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.487" offset="7573295">How it would affect the revenue?</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.123" offset="7579878">How it would affect price control, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.671" offset="7590013">And all I want to do and make at this point is to make clear that that is the fact in which they did take into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.459" offset="7617181">So, they didn't say, "This is absolutely necessary at 100% of cost by this taxpayer."</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.523" offset="7641422">They made a relative determination saying if this is sorted by for only this percentage of cost, then it's in the interest of the National Government and all I'm submitting is that is not a certification that this is absolutely, irrevocably, essential to the Government no matter what the circumstances are with respect to which we thought and with respect to which we'd issued the certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.649" offset="7746017">And all I want to do to make it clear at this point is that these were the very factories which the War Production Board did take into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.996" offset="7779349">In other words, the War Production Board, had it been told, that it must issue either 100% certificate or no -- no certificate and even if it had determined that it did need this particular types of plants, it could have still said in its discretion, "but we don't want it and built by this taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.441" offset="7857089">We will issue no certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.114" offset="7863777">We will ask the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to build us a plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.118" offset="7879868">Ask this taxpayer to lease it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.082" offset="7887705">If he doesn't want to do it, we'll get another contractor for the Government, if not, the Government will run it itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.693" offset="7910170">But we don't have to jeopardize the revenue, the total tax collections and the impact upon the price doctrine by saying that this taxpayer must have this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.542" offset="7953533">It's essential to the war, sure, but not that this taxpayer do it at this price to the Government."</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.571" offset="7985612">And that's the very standard, which the Board set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.741" offset="7994284">It said, ‘We will not issue a certificate for 100% in the future if these plants had postwar utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.430" offset="8029080">We will only issue them if they don't have any."</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.854" offset="8038797">That means the taxpayer will utilize the full value of the facility in creating income during the emergency and after that, he'll have nothing left of value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.780" offset="8074533">He should deduct 100% of the cost during the time he's earning the income.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.010" offset="8095431">But he was still going to have -- they have here perhaps a machine tool, will last 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.313" offset="8120613">The war may last only another two years.Why should the Government subsidize this taxpayer to have machine tools that he'll -- could barely use another 18 years with the cost already written off when the Government could buy the same machine tool, make them available, get the same production for the war and still have the tools for itself after the war.</text>
