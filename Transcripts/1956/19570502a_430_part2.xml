            <text syncTime="816.611" offset="3369775">Well, Your Honor, with respect to the legislative history of Section 3616, a section which states back -- which dates back to 1798, our research has indicated there is the gravest doubt as to whether it applies or contended to apply to federal income tax as we have known it since 1913.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.545" offset="3477504">Now, back in the civil war days when you have the Acts of 1861, 1862 and 1864, where they included a statute which was very similar to 3616 within the Act itself, I think it is safe to assume that that Act did apply to this civil war income tax which did not have any other sanctions of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.760" offset="3586382">And again in 1894, when the income tax law was passed which was held unconstitutional by this Court in the Pollock against Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Company case.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.880" offset="3642911">There again, we had no sanctions within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.910" offset="3655032">So, and it seems fair to assume that the sanctions of section -- had become in 1874, 3179 of the revised statutes was intended to be the specific sanction which would apply to that particular Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.622" offset="3729847">But when we come down to the War Revenue Act of 1894, which were not an income tax law but a General Revenue Act, that Act had specific penalties and it provided that if any manufacturer or maker makes a false run through declaration, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor with a sentence of six months in prison or $500 fine or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.109" offset="3835800">Now, there we had specific penalties applying to that particular Act and it would appear that the general earlier provision of the 1874 revised statutes were superseded pro tanto.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.589" offset="3909778">Again in 1909, when that corporation exercised tax of that year measured by corporate income was passed -- it had passed specific penalties for the making of a fraudulent -- false or fraudulent return with intent to defeat the assessment of one year in prison or $1000 fine, which incidentally with the same penalties as those in the 3179 of the revised statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.684" offset="4026075">In the Revenue Act of 1913, which is the first of the various revenue acts that followed thereafter and from 1913 to about until 1939, it was the practice of Congress to enact a new revenue act about every two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.038" offset="4099532">Each of those acts would be a complete reenactment of the income tax laws as they had existed up to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.619" offset="4141850">In the Revenue Act of 1913, the first of such acts, Congress provided that whoever made a false or fraudulent return with intent to defeat the assessment would be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a year in the prison on a $2000 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.034" offset="4219486">The fine in this -- in that Act, the $2000 was greater than the $1000 fine imposed by Section 3179 of the revised statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.665" offset="4262013">And we think that that indicates that the specific penalty of that particular Act was intended to apply to the crime of income tax evasion rather than the more general provision carrying a lesser penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.267" offset="4360443">The Revenue Act of 1917 had the same provision as to a false and fraudulent return with intent to defeat an assessment and added a new provision making it a misdemeanor to evade or attempt to evade a tax in any manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1452.559" offset="5913579">When Congress did that as I mentioned in my earlier argument specifically stated that it was not changing existing law and Congress of course must have been aware of the fact that the Government had been prosecuting for more than two years prior to the Revenue Act of 1954, many cases under Section 3616 (a) for income tax violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.783" offset="5994454">I've also pointed out that as far back as 1926 in the Noveck case, the Government argued that Section 3616 (a) wasn't applicable to income taxes but it was nevertheless proceeding over a period of years in many cases to argue that it was applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.693" offset="6058193">In the cases I've cited at page 15 of my reply brief and there are many cases there I've cited.</text>

            <text syncTime="1499.696" offset="6102183">Certainly, in those cases, the Government was of course consistent throughout that period of time in the time when saying it was applicable.</text>
