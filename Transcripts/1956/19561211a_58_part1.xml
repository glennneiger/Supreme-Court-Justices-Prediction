            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 58, Albert Roviaro, Petitioner, versus United States of America.</text>

            <label>Mr. Maurice J. Walsh</label>
            <text syncTime="27.968" offset="215228">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.097" offset="235708">This is a review of a conviction in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois at Chicago, which was affirmed by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.699" offset="282206">The indictment in the case was in two counts charging two events from a transaction, an alleged transaction or event occurring on the evening of August 12, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.451" offset="337168">Count one charged the petitioner did on August 12, 1954, at Chicago, Illinois, sell to John Doe for an unknown consideration, a quantity of narcotics without an order from John Doe on the form prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury in violation of Section 2554(a) of Title 26, U.S.C.A.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.795" offset="434552">Count two charged that the petitioner on August 12, the same night, 1954 at Chicago, Illinois, did then and there, fraudulently and knowingly received concealed, fraudulently and knowingly received concealed, buy and facilitate the transportation and concealment after importation of a quantity of narcotic drug knowing the same to be imported in violation of Section 174, Title 21, United State Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.788" offset="558477">Now, after the plea of not guilty, the defendant filed a bill -- filed for a bill of particulars in which he asked for disclosure of the name of the identity of John Doe.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.808" offset="622634">He asked for the exact date which was alleged under the (Inaudible) he asked for the day -- for the time of the day and the place by street and number in the city of Chicago, where the offense or offenses occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.517" offset="689403">In the bill of particulars, the request was denied in all respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.259" offset="708420">The trial was before a District Judge, without a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.476" offset="729318">Jury was waived by all concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.718" offset="746245">The Government introduced oral evidence of four witnesses and that took up a single day.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.969" offset="775293">The four witnesses were two government agents and two Chicago city policemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.848" offset="798804">And then there were the physical exhibits which are usually introduced in such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.890" offset="818970">And it was stipulated by the parties that if the government chemist was called, he would testify that these physical exhibits that were offered when analyzed as narcotic drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.098" offset="875813">At the close of the government's case, the defendant moved for acquittal and his motion was overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.317" offset="896606">The defendant offered no evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.867" offset="910817">Now, the evidence, well at first, I'll describe the questions as we contend they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.157" offset="944044">And I think that they can best be summarized in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.528" offset="969435">That John Doe in this case was not a mere informer whose identity the Government could keep to itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.576" offset="1017710">John Doe was a participant, active participant in those entire transactions which was described by the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.322" offset="1052609">And under those circumstances, the defendant was entitled to know his identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.428" offset="1077060">I think that he was entitled to know his identity on his request for the – under the bill of particulars.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.740" offset="1102346">Now, in the lower -- in the Court of Appeals, we contend that his conduct permeated all of the events that are involved in both charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.202" offset="1140172">And that the Court of Appeals below was in error when it contended that Roviaro's possession, which I'll get to later, of a narcotic drug, justified his conviction under count two in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.884" offset="1202866">And that, therefore, they would avoid applying the reasoning of three cases which were urged upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.278" offset="1236511">Those were the Portomene case, the Sorrentino case, and the United States versus Conforti, all of which are described in the -- in the briefs and discussed by both parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.685" offset="1286144">Now, in connection with that, I have urged in this -- in this brief, this -- this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.275" offset="1316446">Rule 7C provides for an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.481" offset="1337344">The constitution, the Fifth Amendment provides that a person must be prosecuted for a felony by indictment, unless he waives, of course, in accordance with the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.783" offset="1378513">Rule 7C provides for an indictment and if the indictment conforms to the rule, that is, it is a concise statement of the essential requirements -- essentials of the offense, then that is an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.001" offset="1435355">And you have been indicted in accordance with the Constitution with that amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.215" offset="1456253">But I say that under the present rules of pleading and as prosecutors have been become prone to do, we are no longer securing conformance with the Sixth Amendment which requires that the accused be informed of the nature and cause of his acquisition, another amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.179" offset="1532113">And while the indictment may be sufficient under Rule 7C, and comply with the requirement of the Fifth Amendment, the Sixth Amendment has not been complied with in a great many cases by the type of pleading which has been described by some authors as notice pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.047" offset="1611525">And then, there's a refusal in the discretion of the trial court of the bill of particulars on the theory that it is not a matter of right in the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.367" offset="1664815">It is a matter of discretion in the trial court for substantial error to be determined later, later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.839" offset="1706715">And, of course, in the hodgepodge in -- in the proceeding of trial, the defendant's contention concerning his requirement that concerning his need for information as he goes into trial, his need for the information as to the nature and cause of his acquisition that some degree of particularity disappears in the (Inaudible) of the trial because there's an overwhelming set of facts brought in against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.134" offset="1819878">And it's so easy to say, no substantial error.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.230" offset="1836283">His proof was -- his guilt was apparent.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="435.720" offset="1846209">Do you make the point that you were entitled to a bill of particulars independently of your demand for as a disclosure of this informant's name?</text>

            <text syncTime="445.460" offset="1885184">Yes, I -- I make the contention that the denial of the bill of particulars in this case was reversible error.</text>

            <label>Mr. Maurice J. Walsh</label>
            <text syncTime="456.804" offset="1930637">And that I -- I believe that on the other points we were entitled to the bill of particulars but I think that the substantial error has been so embellished by the occurrences through the trial regarding the identity of John Doe, that that is our principal point.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.400" offset="2016946">Now, our second point, now, the -- every witness in this case, who was offered by the Government, the four witnesses, was enquired upon cross-examination concerning the identity of John Doe.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.310" offset="2080580">Some were even asked if they knew whether he was a living person.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.852" offset="2098761">None denied that they had the knowledge but the objection of the prosecutor was sustained as to the question and pursuit of that line of cross-examination was denied with each witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.476" offset="2161246">Now, the second point, the second question we have is that one of these witnesses, we believe, was contradicted upon a material matter by another government witness and by an exhibit that was introduced into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.090" offset="2235747">And that it was then indicated by the Government that this man has made other extra judicial statements concerning the events of the evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.205" offset="2276185">And a demand was made upon the Government to produce those statements during the trial and this situation developed by examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.419" offset="2313070">And that the man was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.524" offset="2321429">We consider that was violative of the principles of the Gordon decision by this Court in 344 U.S. 414.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.709" offset="2370226">Now, the third point regards the, as much as anything else, the construction of statute 174, Title 21 USC.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.958" offset="2419231">That statute provides that whoever fraudulently or knowingly imports or brings any narcotic drug into the United States, contrary to law, or receives, conceals, buys, sells or in any manner facilitate the transportation, concealment or sale of such narcotics, knowing the same to have been imported contrary to law, and so forth, shall be punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.029" offset="2531453">And then it has a paragraph, "Whenever on trial for a violation of this subdivision, the defendant is shown to have or to have had possession of the narcotic drug, such possession shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction unless the defendant explains the possession to the satisfaction of the jury."</text>
            <text syncTime="628.582" offset="2617657">Now, that the -- the Court of Appeals below avoided construction of the Portomene, Sorrentino and Conforti cases to the facts involved here by stating that since the defendant had possession, under the testimony of a witness, plus inference, therefore, he could not be heard to complain of conviction on count two, even though errors may have occurred through his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.606" offset="2793827">It is our contention that the inference that has been adopted by some of the Courts of Appeal, the effect that any knowledge or excuse me, any possession, any possession; is sufficient to bring this presumption into play, is an erroneous one.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.530" offset="2873448">It is, simply put it, it is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.222" offset="2884211">That I may possess this book.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.409" offset="2905004">Certainly, it is not presumptive that I have them.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.632" offset="2921932">That I know everything that's in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.143" offset="2931963">The -- the possession of a sealed package, fleeting, cursory as it was in this case, passing, in this case and while it was -- is -- while it's described by the witnesses as having been in the possession of the defendant, it was in his possession for a mere few seconds and at that time they were unable to describe its physical characteristics, it's size or shape.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.487" offset="3045334">But in any event, it is the contention of the Government that that possession of that sealed package brought home to this defendant, not only knowledge that it was imported in violation of the law, but had him know that it was narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.281" offset="3128508">Now, it is the presumption that he knows that it's narcotic, that I quarrel with.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.873" offset="3154840">I say that it is not reasonable and especially where the proof in all of these cases requires that a government chemist, a technical person testify as to the chemical content and to show, in order to show that these packages do contain narcotics.</text>

            <text syncTime="792.401" offset="3273017">So that the other question, you're not -- you're not drawing any argument from what was or wasn't allowed in under count one that's bearing upon count two.</text>

            <text syncTime="802.706" offset="3314186">We haven't done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.935" offset="3327143">Now, there have been some constructions of that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.261" offset="3352430">The (Inaudible) case, and the Government has relied also on the Casey which is not a construction of that statue, but a construction of 2554 or 53 of Title 26, the purchase and sale of -- of narcotics though, Title 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.211" offset="3424214">But in that statute there's also a presumption, but there the presumption is only that such possession shall be prima facie evidence of a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.240" offset="3484296">In this statute, the presumption, justice shall be deemed, the possession shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction unless the defendant explains the possession to the satisfaction of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.576" offset="3549706">Now, I'd like to describe the facts in the case very briefly, and then go back to these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.952" offset="3579173">The -- all four witnesses, the agents and the two policemen described the meeting at a certain corner in Chicago on August 12, 1954 with John Doe.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.365" offset="3624835">They were in their automobiles and various preliminaries occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.782" offset="3642493">That he was -- there were two meetings, actually, and he was searched each time, but when we get into the action which triggers these events, ultimately, we -- we find that he was searched and then he was permitted to get into his own Cadillac automobile, which had already been searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.153" offset="3723995">And he drove to a certain street corner and the agents then took up positions close by in their automobiles, from which they could keep observation of this Cadillac.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.475" offset="3773315">That one of the agents was in the trunk of the Cadillac, and peculiarly enough he was the tallest and heaviest of the agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.311" offset="3808632">He was six feet three and weighed 230.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.892" offset="3818977">But in any event he concealed himself in the trunk of the Cadillac.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.912" offset="3839039">They remained for an hour and five minutes at this corner, awaiting something.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.733" offset="3862340">At the end of the hour, at 11 o'clock the automobile -- an automobile, a Pontiac automobile arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.137" offset="3899956">The defendant got out from behind the driver's seat, entered the passenger seat beside the driver in the Cadillac, and the Pontiac was driven away by a person who had accompanied the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.029" offset="3947499">That is, I say the defendant, that's what the witnesses for the Government said.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.150" offset="3964008">And all three, other than the man in the trunk, identified him at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.389" offset="3996923">The Cadillac then took off in a circuitous route according to these men, first followed by one automobile and closely and then that tail was taken up by a -- a second automobile in which there was a single agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.365" offset="4056795">The one containing two, gave up the -- the following after several blocks and then the single agent stayed behind the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.394" offset="4100995">From a point of about, I think he called it exactly, he said he had measured it later on, at 94 feet away, at 11 o'clock at night or somewhat after that, by the aid of a street light and a bright moon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.299" offset="4168600">He saw the -- the Cadillac stop, and the door immediately opened, the defendant leave the Cadillac, walk to a tree five or six feet away, bend over and pick up a package, the physical characteristics of which he was unable to determine at that time, he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.765" offset="4250415">Walked back to the Cadillac, which was parked and leaned in as though depositing something on the seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.535" offset="4281553">The defendant then waived his hand as to say farewell and walked away, and was later seen to get into the Pontiac and drive away.</text>

            <text syncTime="1091.805" offset="4470575">Now, the play on the word "package", "the" and "a" is considerable in this case, but in any event, the witnesses described, of course, that he picked up a package.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.867" offset="4518849">Now, this is two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.140" offset="4523969">One is a man standing on the street 96 feet away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.504" offset="4541419">The other is the man concealed in the trunk and each says he picked up a package.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.144" offset="4559914">One, and one only Durham, says that he leaned into the car as though depositing something in the -- on the seat and when his hand came out it was empty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.915" offset="4615084">The defendant walked away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.236" offset="4620309">Immediately after this, Durham, this agent, approached the Cadillac, went to the right front seat, to the passenger's seat and found an envelope on the floor of the car, beside John Doe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.483" offset="4681331">Now, bear in mind, John Doe, there -- there is no testimony to connect this man with -- with any offense at all until he enters the automobile of John Doe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.102" offset="4731800">Then he drives or he doesn't drive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.740" offset="4742353">John Doe drives and there's conversation saying about -- talking about details and things of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.551" offset="4773595">There's a little controversy over the admission of that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.205" offset="4788224">The judge -- the trial judge stated that unless Bryson, the man in the trunk could identify the defendant as being the person who was talking, he would not admit it, but he would rule on that later, because there was no jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.248" offset="4852381">There, he -- he did not -- he would exclude it later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.336" offset="4868681">He did not exclude it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.617" offset="4873801">I assume that he considered it, but in any event, there was some conversation along that, and I would say in fairness that the other the -- the three witnesses having seen Roviaro, get in the car and the car taking off immediately and having them followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.976" offset="4939316">That it was probably a fair inference that Roviaro was talking, if we're to consider the testimony of the witnesses, which in the light that we must.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.672" offset="4974111">But in any event, this package is recovered now by, according to this version, by Durham, from the floor of John Doe's personally owned automobile, the Cadillac, in John Doe's presence, while John Doe has been present with the door of his car open watching, well, there isn't testimony to that effect, but I assume it can be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.116" offset="5107858">He could have watched, watching Roviaro, walk to the -- walk to the tree, pick up the package, and come back and either that is the package that was found in the car or it wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.625" offset="5169821">Now, the trial judge apparently took the inference that it was, because -- and I -- I assume that we're -- we're faced with that, as a matter of fact at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.228" offset="5220289">But in any event, there is display in the testimony and he picked up a package and from thereon, there is conversation by the witnesses, by the government counsel throughout the case, at every stage of just the package.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.969" offset="5287267">Now, that's the possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.635" offset="5305866">That's the possession of Roviaro.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.390" offset="5320913">From the tree to the seat of John Doe's car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.455" offset="5345155">I submit that the package was actually recovered from John Doe's possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.687" offset="5366157">I submit that the possession with that car open, that John Doe was driving, Roviaro, walking to get the package, is it in any sense a mutual possession that they were acting together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.374" offset="5428851">Certainly, either it could have been indicted as the aider and abettor of the other, if each was a criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.953" offset="5455182">Now, John Doe has been described here by the agents as an informer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.917" offset="5475035">Well, of course, we don't -- we don't really know that, other than their mere claim -- other than their mere claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.121" offset="5519862">He has never been produced, his name has never been disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.142" offset="5535953">His identity has never been disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.351" offset="5548805">Now, after about an hour, now, the -- bearing in mind the suspicious attitude of the agents, naturally, in following this car, nevertheless, they watched Roviaro walk away and now this seems an unnatural situation in a way that a contraband of that nature would be deposited in a vehicle which could move at high speed and that stood still and the pedestrian walks away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.821" offset="5694673">And he walks away within the observation of the agents and no attempt is made to apprehend him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.131" offset="5715884">About an hour and half later, they went to his home in another part of Chicago.</text>

            <text syncTime="1568.110" offset="6375842">And John Doe, for some reason of detection or something, I don't know what it was, they claim he was their informer, is asked, “Do you know this man?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.564" offset="6429654">He said, “No, I never saw him before.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.871" offset="6442820">He said that of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.985" offset="6451284">That was developed on cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.085" offset="6459747">At one point the trial judge struck that out and with another witness he permitted it to stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="1647.134" offset="6691924">And in order to prepare for either, it was necessary to know who John Doe was, if we were to make any effort to determine, what he might have to say if called as a witness.</text>
