            <text syncTime="35.916" offset="246993">The issue in this case is whether with respect to an alien who has been ordered deported but whose deportation has not been accomplished, the Government may exercise supervision, not only to insure his availability for deportation but also to prevent a continuation of the type of conduct which led to the order for deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.572" offset="389622">In the present case, Mr. George I. Witkovich, the alien, was indicted for refusing to answer certain questions which would put to him by the Immigration Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.346" offset="444792">He had earlier been ordered deported and attempts had been made to remove him to Yugoslavia.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.562" offset="481573">However, more than six months have elapsed since the order of deportation and the deportation had not been accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.257" offset="524413">Meanwhile, an order of supervision had been served on him requiring him -- requiring him to report monthly to the Immigration Service, not to change his residence without giving notice and not to engage in Communist activities or to associate with Communists.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.910" offset="623052">The Immigration Act provides that an alien subject to a supervisory order shall give information under oath when requested with respect to his nationality, his habits, circumstances, his associates and his activities, such of the matters as the Attorney General may deem fit and proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.259" offset="724407">In an attempt to find out whether Mr. Witkovich was continuing his activities with the Communists, an -- an investigator for the Immigration Service asked him a serious -- series of questions dealing with his associations and his activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.702" offset="802147">And these he declined to answer, not claiming -- specifically, not claiming the protection of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.538" offset="837569">Now under the Act, it is a crime to refuse to answer such questions if these were proper questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.526" offset="873514">Mr. Witkovich was indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.358" offset="884799">The District Court dismissed the indictment on the ground that the statute must be construed to permit questions which deal solely with the alien's availability for deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.519" offset="945403">And since the questions involved did not deal solely with this question but rather with the question of his activities and associations with the Communist Party that the indictment was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.052" offset="999528">And since this -- the dismissal results from a construction of the statute, we are here on direct appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2623.974" offset="10599320">The second -- the second clue we have to the meaning of this language is its -- its location in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.303" offset="10628577">It -- it follows -- this section follows immediately after the section dealing with retaining an alien in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.540" offset="10669537">And as I mentioned before, that section was before this Court in Carlson against Landon 342 U.S.524.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.878" offset="10706840">And presumably that the purposes of the strict custody of -- of retaining a man in confinement and the elastic custody that can be called out of -- of the supervisory order are -- are related.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.644" offset="10773922">And this Court -- this Court, both the majority and the minority, specifically interpreted the custody provisions as in -- as authorizing the Attorney General to keep the man in confinement if he had reason to believe that it was necessary for the security of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.561" offset="10857618">And the third way to find out the meaning of this statute I suppose is the legislative history and we speak with it at some length in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.884" offset="10894921">The truth of the matter is that from 1939 and 1950, Representative Holmes pressed for legislation to protect the country from deportable aliens, not only submissives, but other aliens guilty of other -- of other offenses to protect the country from -- of their presence here when they've been ordered deported and couldn't be deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.856" offset="10990843">And when he was finally able to -- to get this enacted into law was when the Internal Security Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.666" offset="11026056">This provision was originally a section of the Internal Security Act and it this was well known, the prime object of that Act was to protect this country against communist activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.430" offset="11085093">Now, in the legislative history, we have a presidential message.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.231" offset="11104319">We have a recommendation from the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.519" offset="11117484">We have reports from the judiciary committees of both Houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.708" offset="11134203">We have statements by Representative Holmes on -- on from the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.827" offset="11150712">And they all, without exception, tie the supervision of these aliens in with the question of their continued antisocial activity rather than with their availability for deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.962" offset="11207241">And if there were -- if there were further need for -- for interpreting the statute, I might point out that this provision was reenacted by Congress in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.311" offset="11252590">It originally passed as part of the Internal Security Act in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.901" offset="11270980">After that, this Court construed the custody provisions in Carlson against Landon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.301" offset="11292609">And after that, the Court reenacted -- the Congress reenacted the section in 1952 so that we have here a case of reenactment of -- of this provision after interpretation by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.835" offset="11354676">It seems -- it seems clear to me that the court below must have reached its interpretation because it felt that unless it limited the statute to availability for deportation, it would have grave constitutional questions as to whether that was a power under the Constitution to -- to hold the -- to hold the alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.057" offset="11439626">But I think it's of somewhat doubtful humanity to mutilate a statute by cutting off two arms and a leg in order to uphold the remnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.602" offset="11485811">If we are right, the Congress clearly intended the Attorney General to have power -- supervisory power over activity, by then the Court was stepping into the legislative field when it interpreted the statute as it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.076" offset="11543698">And it seems -- it seems clear to us that the statute as written is constitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2882.606" offset="11633768">The basic constitutional issue is -- and the appellee restates it in -- in many guises, but the basic constitutional issue is whether the exercise of supervisory restraints over these aliens deprives them of liberty without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.849" offset="11706807">The argument is that they have not been found guilty of any crime and indeed this alien hasn't been found guilty -- guilty of any crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.770" offset="11734497">And that therefore, any attempt to restrict his activity is a punishment which is imposed upon him without indictment, jury trial or the other safeguards of the criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.272" offset="11784443">And if these were a punishment, if the aim and -- and the result of this kind of a supervisory order were a punishment, I believe the statute would be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.507" offset="11829373">In similar situation, the -- the -- this Court upset a -- a Immigration Act way back in 1896 in Wong Wing against United States which was a case of imprisoning Chinese without jury trial, without any trial in administrative imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.679" offset="11902098">And the Court had no difficulty in saying that that was a punishment and that it should -- that the -- and was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.771" offset="11934490">But the -- this type of restraint which we have in this case is not imposed as -- as a punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.737" offset="11962284">It is imposed because there is some necessity of -- of preventing aliens which have been found engaged in antisocial activities and ordered deported from continuing to perform the same activities in the interim before they can finally be removed.</text>
