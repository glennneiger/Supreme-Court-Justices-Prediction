            <text syncTime="26.787" offset="210526">In the early summer of 1954, Mr. Butler, the appellant in this case, sold a book to an adult police officer in Detroit, Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.347" offset="264756">For this, he was promptly arrested, prosecuted and convicted under a statute which, from the very outset of the litigation to this very day in Court, we have contended is an invasion of the freedom of press and of due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.128" offset="343855">After our conviction in the trial court, we sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Michigan and the prosecutor, in consenting to the appeal, certified to the Court that in his opinion, the statute needed clarification.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.936" offset="419088">But the Supreme Court of Michigan denied our application for leave to appeal and we had no clarification.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.151" offset="459943">Now, before I start on the main argument of the case, I should like to just clear the atmosphere for a second to indicate what is not in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.255" offset="496410">We fully recognize that this is not a case of prior restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.805" offset="514591">We were convicted for selling a book.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.541" offset="529533">Second of all, we also recognized that a properly drawn statute forbidding and punishing the distribution of obscene literature, just as simply as that, would be certainly valid under the exercise of a state of police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.323" offset="596616">In other words, if the statute said it is a crime to distribute obscene literature, we say that that would be valid under the state police power.</text>

            <text syncTime="350.886" offset="1506931">And it also appear that in some of these stores, school supplies may be sold.</text>

            <text syncTime="444.088" offset="1879751">There was no problem about that but it was not on the open shelves where children might get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.706" offset="1902216">Now, just take the position, of course, that if the library had a copy of the hardcover, which you would pay $3 or $4 for and it was -- you wanted to replace it or get a new one, if they wanted us to get this -- the same book for 50 cents and save the library's money and wanted this edition of the book, nobody would dare to sell it to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.097" offset="1995734">Now, the book itself, we've talked about the distribution and the format of this book.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.826" offset="2014647">The book itself is a -- has been paraphrased in my brief, it has been elaborately commented upon on the record but frankly, it's a story of a conflict within a man.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.116" offset="2055816">It's the story of a man who has tasted worldly life and earthly pleasures and as a student of musicology comes to this Benedictine monastery in the countryside of France to study the Gregorian chant.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.707" offset="2122167">He lives in the monastery and then from there, for the first time in his life, he feels a different spirit evolving about him, he feels a call to an inner peace and -- and happiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.551" offset="2165530">He starts to realize that his life head him to fleshly as it may have been is not what he is ultimately content with and he has this conflict developing in himself with how much of the world will he give up and how much peace and security are represented by the monastery.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.704" offset="2230209">Ultimately, he is one through the sanctity but not without some tempestuous problems on route.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.562" offset="2257586">Now, of course, he reminisces this from time to time as to his prior pleasures and dalliances and, of course, from time to time he lapses away from the monastic life.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.001" offset="2299382">Now, some of this language and some of the description, I admit, is in -- of -- of earthy nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.719" offset="2326235">It is realistic writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.246" offset="2332400">It is of the naturalistic vein.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.444" offset="2341177">There is some discussion and treatment of sex situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.077" offset="2355702">There was also the blunt and earthy idiom of the French countryside.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.124" offset="2375868">But view it as a whole, as I will argue later and say now, as it must be, these were in parts that were indigenous to the story and at least fairly, reasonably connected with its plot.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.570" offset="2425605">Now, at the trial when our constitutional objections were overruled, we went ahead and defended this book on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.686" offset="2458102">We -- the two eminent professors, one from the University of Pennsylvania and one from the University of Michigan, the very area where the prosecution was brought, testified that in their opinion, this was a serious work.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.039" offset="2507525">It was excellent writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.491" offset="2513377">It was high -- highly ethical -- ethically motivated novel.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.990" offset="2531349">And that viewed as a whole and by its dominating -- dominating themes, it was a good piece of literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.957" offset="2559248">It would be hard to fathom under that testimony how our proof beyond a reasonable doubt could be established, but we have to look to the statute itself to find out exactly how we were convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.621" offset="2625808">The statute says that if the book contains language in description which is obscene, and I'm coming to the other point just take it from obscene, it is a crime to distribute that book.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.752" offset="2690382">Now, I don't have to labor the point to -- to show that we certainly contained in isolated aspects, certain -- certain language which of -- is not related to the whole might be offensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.931" offset="2743045">But if -- the -- the statute in this case permits a conviction for the containing, not -- and does not, in the realistic sense, consider that the book must be treated as a whole and by its dominant theme.</text>

            <text syncTime="1518.107" offset="6175848">I come again to the statute and say that, what this statute also does is to say that if this book contains any languages and -- and descriptions which is -- which of -- is obscene for children, it can't be sold to anyone.</text>

            <text syncTime="1617.186" offset="6572074">Actually, the statute, itself, I term, a legislative clarification of the rule in the Hicklin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.856" offset="6598823">The old 1868 rule in England was that a book was to be considered obscene if the matter had a tendency to debase or corrupt the minds or morals of anyone in to whose hands it might fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.328" offset="6660681">Therefore, it was the children and the village idiot and the moron that might be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.221" offset="6684296">Now, by the last 20 years, most of the courts in this country have abandoned the implications of the Hicklin rule, not -- not every single court but most of them have abandoned the implications of the Hicklin rule and taken a better position and saying that it's the average person's sex instincts which are the -- used to be the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.741" offset="6770291">In other words, if the book is viewed as a whole and by its dominant themes, it's dirt for dirt sake to the average person or just stimulates the sexual appetite of -- of all classes of a community that it can -- can be considered obscene.</text>

            <text syncTime="2595.166" offset="10484067">In that case, publisher of a newspaper was taxed under this very law with publishing a story, I think, double meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="2698.154" offset="10895966">Now, for the life of me, I can't see anything vague or indefinite in -- in that language because the -- the keyword there is this word "obscenity" as the dictionary defines it and merely because you have phrases added to that doesn't deprive the person of his constitutional rights because it's all hooked up to that keyword.</text>
