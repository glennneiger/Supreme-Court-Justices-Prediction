            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 162, Shirley Kremen, Samuel Irving Coleman and Sidney Steinberg, Petitioners versus United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.778" offset="150444">Mr. Leonard.</text>

            <label>Mr. Norman Leonard</label>
            <text syncTime="12.927" offset="155042">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.137" offset="171969">This case is here on certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which had affirmed judgments of conviction rendered at the jury trial in the District Court in Northern District of California against the three petitioners here.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.560" offset="241664">The petitioners who before the Court are as the Mr. Chief Justice has just indicated, Shirley Kremen, Samuel Coleman and Sidney Steinberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.754" offset="274369">Originally, if the Court please, there were five defendants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.622" offset="289834">These three petitioners and two others, one Patricia Blau who was acquitted at the end of the government's case by the district judge and one Carl Ross who was found guilty, but who being unable to raise the bail that was required of him on appeal has served his sentence and so no longer a party to this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.837" offset="374680">In that connection, I might say that some of these other petitioners also have served portions of this sentence because of the difficulties that they had in raising bail, but subsequently, they did raise bail and they are now out but there are still substantial portions of the sentences remaining to be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.295" offset="432567">So that no sentence in this case is moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.086" offset="443747">But petitioner Kremen was able to raise her bail initially so she still has her full sentence ahead of her.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.875" offset="466840">The indictment which was returned is in four counts and it charged in the first count that when Robert Thompson had been convicted of conspiracy to violate the Smith Act in New York in 1949, parenthetically, I might observed that Thompson was one of the defendants in the Dennis case which was ultimately affirmed in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.549" offset="557537">And that first count continued to charge that all five of those named defendants, that is three petitioners here and the two others who I mentioned, were accessories after the fact to the Smith Act conviction in 1949 in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.670" offset="618036">It was alleged that they were accessories after the fact in 1953 in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.549" offset="637576">I might also say parenthetically here that we do not concede that count one properly stated the offense for which Thompson was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.980" offset="675297">I will come to that point later.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.225" offset="680312">That's one of the points on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.882" offset="686895">Here I simply wish to summarize the indictment with the Court as a prelude to the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.461" offset="709256">The second count of the indictment alleged that all five of those defendants, three petitioners here and the two others, conspired to violate the accessory after the fact statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.059" offset="747604">In other words, it was a conspiracy to commit the offense which was importantly described in the first count of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.774" offset="774457">The third count of the indictment charged that all of the defendants except Steinberg, that is the remaining four knowing that a warrant had been issued for Steinberg's arrest, harbored and concealed him contrary to the provisions of the harboring statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.666" offset="837987">Incidentally, I might observe that the warrant for Steinberg's arrest was in the proceeding in New York which later became known as United States against Flynn which Mr. Justice Harlan sat and the case was in the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.895" offset="882918">The certiorari was denied here, the so-called the second string Smith Act cases in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.725" offset="902248">There was a warrant up for Steinberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.528" offset="913533">He was found to use later in California and was alleged that these people had harbored.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.598" offset="933804">And the fourth count, the last count of the indictment alleged that all four of these defendants conspired to harbor Steinberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.907" offset="958986">So it was a conspiracy charge to commit the subsequent offense set forth in the third count of the indictment and in that conspiracy charge, Thompson was named as a co-conspirator but not as a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.668" offset="1006007">After the indictments were returned, various pretrial motions were made attacking their sufficiency, seeking particulars and other forms of pretrial discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.768" offset="1038399">Those motions were all denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.853" offset="1046758">I think more important for the argument today that should be noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.080" offset="1063685">But after the indictments were returned, motions seeking the suppression of evidence allegedly illegally obtained at the time these petitioners were arrested were also, those motions were supported by affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.985" offset="1111333">They appear on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.054" offset="1115617">The affidavits appear in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.102" offset="1123767">Pretrial hearings were held on motion to suppress and testimony was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.954" offset="1143202">Those motions were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.933" offset="1151143">At the time the evidence which we claimed was illegally seized was tendered on the trial, motions to suppress it were renewed and objections to the evidence were made on the ground but it was illegally obtained in violation of the guarantees in the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.736" offset="1214360">The motions to suppress were denied and the objections were overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.321" offset="1236616">While initially while I'm on the subject of evidence, I think this should be mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.130" offset="1255842">Much of the evidence that was received by the trial court was offered and received against an individual defendant -- the specific defendant with whom there was some apparent connection with a particular item of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.209" offset="1308191">Before the case went to the jury, the Government moved that all of the evidence be received against all of the defendants and that motion was granted and it was that posture of the evidence that the case went to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.331" offset="1360645">At the conclusion of the Government's case, motions of the judgment of acquittal were made and as indicated were granted only as to the defendant Blau that was denied --</text>

            <text syncTime="328.942" offset="1419160">Yes, Your Honor and it is particularly significant on the question of the search and seizure because as I understand the Government's position, it seeks to segregate some of this evidence and says that these petitioners were here before the court today may not complain if evidence that was illegally obtained from somebody else was received.</text>

            <text syncTime="383.079" offset="1635662">After the jury was out -- it was out for some substantial period of time, nine hours and reported an inability to agree on some counts at least and a verdict then have to some further instructions and return a guilty verdict against all of the defendants on all of the counts.</text>

            <text syncTime="425.124" offset="1803891">The questions which we presented by the writ and the writ was granted without any limitation are substantially these.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.367" offset="1836805">Whether the search of the premises which was occupied by the petitioners at the time of the arrest and the seizure of the books, papers, documents and other evidence that was so seized there were in violation of the Fourth Amendment whether or not the introduction of the evidence so seized was in violation of the Fifth.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.501" offset="1909426">The second point on the writ was whether or not the relevant sections of the criminal statutes involved were unconstitutionally applied to these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.446" offset="1941191">There are certain sub-points in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.796" offset="1950595">And the third question presented by the writ is whether the indictment, at least the first count of it, stated an offense and whether or not there was a variance between it and the proof whether the trial judge's charge is correct on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.771" offset="2006497">And again, that is a matter which I would like to develop when I get to that point of the argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="487.426" offset="2053099">We argued that primarily as an incident to the search point.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.602" offset="2073788">That's -- that's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.995" offset="2083401">At the -- after the verdict's return, sentences of varying lengths were imposed upon the petitioners and the cases of two of them, Coleman and Steinberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.641" offset="2121958">Those sentences were consecutive so that the Court is faced with the problem of examining the -- each of the individual counts in those cases because we don't have the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.870" offset="2162813">We have concurrent sentences and it can be sustained on one count, that's the end of it, because here we have this reversed situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.485" offset="2189354">And in the case of Kremen, although the sentences were concurrent, the sentence on the first and second count of the indictment was a one year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.560" offset="2229582">Our position which I will develop a little bit later on the argument is that at most there was an act of harboring here.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.015" offset="2255391">The statute on the harboring count permits a maximum sentence of only six months and so we contend that despite the fact that the sentences were concurrent, there was no warrant for the one year sentence under the accessory count because all we have here we say is an act of harboring which is a misdemeanor with a six-month sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="614.715" offset="2562278">I separate my discussion of the facts because I believe the law to be that the Court may only consider when it is concerned with the search and seizure point and the arrest point which we raised in a manner I indicated to Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.956" offset="2627166">The Court may only consider the evidence that the officers knew at that time, an evidence which was subsequently developed, of course is not relevant on the question of validity of the arrest of the search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.945" offset="2667186">So the evidence which was known as far it's revealed by this record, at the time that the arrest and the search and seizure took place was this, that four of these original defendants, three petitioners who were here and Ross were arrested shortly after 1 o'clock in the afternoon of August 27th, 1953 at a cabin or a house in Twain Harte, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.448" offset="2761122">Twain Harte is a small summer resort town near Sonora, California and the Mother Lode country in the foothills of the Sierras.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.567" offset="2789648">At the time that those four were arrested, there was also present on the premises, Robert Thompson, a defendant from the Dennis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.795" offset="2822562">Patricia Blau, the other defendant was arrested later in the day at a different place apparently arrested from some leads that the government agents obtained when they went through the -- premises of Twain Harte.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.204" offset="2864149">The fact that she was arrested later I think is enough for us to -- to pass over her arrest because certainly nothing that the officers learned when they arrested her five or six or seven hours later but retrospectively so to speak, justify the arrest at 1 o'clock in the afternoon so we have to go back to that situation I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.013" offset="2931440">Now, this record reveals and I think it's undisputed that for some period of time prior to these actual arrests, these agents had the petitioners under some substantial surveillance and that they're very carefully prepared these arrests.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.534" offset="2981491">The record shows that agents who had their headquarters in New York City had arrived in San Francisco at least two days before the arrests to participate in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.042" offset="3015555">And other agents from the San Francisco area had gone up to Twain Harte at least two days before the arrest or participate in the arrests.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.124" offset="3043871">Now one of them had actually gone to the premises the day before with an employee of Pacific Gas and Electric Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.934" offset="3079084">The agents sat on the truck while the employee went on the premises on a pretext in inspecting a light meter or gas meter or something in the agents premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.050" offset="3111581">Also, when they came out the next day they brought with them a (Inaudible) apparently aware of the fact that there was a female on the premises and they were going to arrest her.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.739" offset="3146376">Now, how much longer than the two or three days that the record reveals, the agents were actually engaged in preparing for this arrest, or how much longer they had these petitioners under surveillance is not revealed by the record for the reasons that although we sought this information both on the motions to suppress on the trial itself, the trial judge precluded us by his rulings to sustain government objections by finding it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.382" offset="3236864">And he wouldn't let us go beyond the point when the agents left their headquarters to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.906" offset="3259016">How much else there was?</text>
            <text syncTime="790.477" offset="3265285">We do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.210" offset="3268211">But we do know this that the arrests were carefully prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.773" offset="3290467">A continued surveillance was maintained for at least eight hours prior to the time of the actual arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.077" offset="3311679">Agents were stationed around the cabin.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.552" offset="3321605">They maintained an elaborate communication system with their headquarters and walkie-talkie setup so they could report to their headquarters what was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.686" offset="3354102">It's interesting to note that all the reports they made indicated nothing but normal activities that one would expect in a -- in a summer resort area.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.389" offset="3388897">Thompson was seen to come out practicing fly cast.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.436" offset="3401122">Other people were walking round the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.137" offset="3407914">Somebody was sitting down at the table outside the building and probably drawing or writing and Mrs. Kremen came out in the middle of the morning apparently and hang up some laundry.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.614" offset="3449814">By noon of that day according to the agents, they satisfied themselves with two of the people that they have under observation were Thompson and Steinberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.961" offset="3487222">They said they have some difficulty at first because there were -- there was substantial change in appearances.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.114" offset="3507806">Thompson didn't look like he had look when he was in New York a couple of years earlier when they had known him.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.083" offset="3523688">Steinberg had to put on some weight, but they satisfied themselves that these were the men that they were looking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.097" offset="3547721">They relayed this information to their superiors and were told to standby to assist a raiding party and that was their own characterization of what it was, a raiding party that would come up in effect the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.392" offset="3592965">And about 1 o'clock in the afternoon, something like 15 agents with the matrons swoop down on the cabin.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.538" offset="3621491">And at that moment, Thompson and Steinberg were outside the cabin about 40 or 50 feet away from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.262" offset="3644374">They were immediately taken into custody and they were advised that they were being arrested for the Smith Act violations on the outstanding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.884" offset="3670915">There was no show of resistance by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.618" offset="3677811">No attempt to flee.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.707" offset="3682200">No weapons of any kind were found.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.607" offset="3689827">No weapons of any kind were found in any place on anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.140" offset="3703933">The others, Ross, Coleman and Kremen were inside the cabin.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.892" offset="3726921">The agents were sent to the cabin and ordered them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.632" offset="3737893">At this point, I should like to say this that in the briefs, both sides, the Government and us have assumed that the arrests of those three, Ross, Kremen and Coleman took place inside the cabin.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.060" offset="3787630">However, a more careful reading of the record I think convinces me that I was in error in making that assumption in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.025" offset="3811453">And I think the record doesn't justify an assumption that those three were arrested inside the cabin.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.876" offset="3830888">I don't want to labor this point because our case doesn't turn on it of course, but I do think that the Court should know and I'd like to direct your attention specifically to page 101 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.102" offset="3875819">It appears in the first volume where -- when the agent in charge of the operation was being interrogated on the pretrial proceedings on the motion to suppress and his attention was specifically directed to what happened with the three people inside the cabin.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.733" offset="3950320">He says -- I don't think I need to read it to the Court at page 101 of volume 1 -- volume 1 of the record at page 101.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.278" offset="3988459">The Court will see he says that they were taken outside and advised that they were being under arrest and specifically the question is asked in the middle of page, "When was that?</text>
            <text syncTime="981.881" offset="4030882">While still in the -- in the house or after you had taken them outside?"</text>
            <text syncTime="984.983" offset="4043316">Answer "While they were all outside."</text>
            <text syncTime="987.390" offset="4052929">And then counsel restates it, "Is this correct, that you found the other three defendants in that house?"</text>
            <text syncTime="999.415" offset="4100995">"Yes sir."</text>
            <text syncTime="993.687" offset="4100890">"You gave orders because they're taken outside?"</text>
            <text syncTime="996.112" offset="4100786">And outside they were told that they were under arrest for the reasons you indicated?"</text>
            <text syncTime="999.860" offset="4102771">And were they handcuffed?</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.914" offset="4107055">They were all then handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.749" offset="4114369">So, I think this is circumstance as I say our case certainly doesn't turn by any manner it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.149" offset="4135999">But I think it's a circumstance to be considered in assessing the reasonableness of the subsequent search that the arrests of these people, two apparently even occurred outside of the cabin.</text>

            <text syncTime="2826.670" offset="11410056">I was going to say that the conspiracy requires proof of both the substantive offense and an agreement and therefore if he didn't prove the substantive offense -- but that isn't so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.203" offset="11440149">I think what he must have had in mind is this, that the failure of proof with respect to the substantive offense of harboring, indicates also that there was a failure of proof with respect to conspiracy for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.180" offset="11488110">Because he said that the reason he gave for believing that there was no proof of harboring was that there was no proof that these people had the requisite knowledge that they knew that the person was a fugitive or that they knew that there was process for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.766" offset="11542444">Therefore, the substantive count had to fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.865" offset="11550804">Well, if there was no proof that they knew that there was process for him or knew that he was a fugitive, there couldn't have been any proof of conspiracy to do that either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.038" offset="11579538">I think that was the basis of Judge Denman's reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="2885.718" offset="11646203">But to say this, the Government contends that there - it approved here two separate conspiracies, one conspiracy to harbor Steinberg, one conspiracy to be accessories after the fact of Thompson's arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.453" offset="11697194">They said there are two separate conspiracies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.649" offset="11705971">Again, we argued that the proof was identical, the overt acts were identical but quite apart from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.719" offset="11726242">If the Government's theory is set, they could have charged these people with three conspiracies, the Steinberg conspiracy and Thompson conspiracy and a joint conspiracy which they say occurred later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.605" offset="11765844">As a matter of fact, the record and the briefs reveal and I think the Government will dispute it that about this time although it isn't true today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.268" offset="11792488">At about this time, there was some five or six of these fugitives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.286" offset="11808475">Our contention is that certainly, it couldn'tbeen said that if all five or six of those fugitives were found there that there were five or six separate conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.281" offset="11836479">There was one conspiracy as a matter -- if there was any at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.254" offset="11848391">As a matter of fact, the prosecutor so stated in his opening argument to the jury, called this a Communist Party conspiracy to protect its leadership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.177" offset="11880051">The mere fact that they protected two leaders or three leaders or four leaders wouldn't make it two or three or four conspiracies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.312" offset="11900635">I don't think the offenses could be so multiply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.320" offset="11912652">Now, finally, we contend on our third point, I haven't touched all the sub-points or the second point, the time won't permit it but we contend that the indictment was defective for this reason, that it alleged that Thompson was guilty of a conspiracy to organize a society to overthrow the government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.171" offset="11996035">In violation of Sections 2, 3 and 5 of the Smith Act, 2, 3 and 5 of the Smith Act of course do not deal with that kind of a conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.103" offset="12023829">They deal with conspiracies to teach inevitably.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.456" offset="12033233">We said the indictment was inconsistent on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.707" offset="12046190">On the one hand, it says, he was guilty of the offense of conspiring to overthrow in violation of a statute which doesn't talk about all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.908" offset="12082970">The proof was a variance with the indictment if you eliminate the conclusion about the Smith Act from the indictment because the proof was that the conspiracy was to teach and advocate rather than to organize or overthrow and the trial judge erroneously instructed the jury that the proof conformed to the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.817" offset="12170637">But we think that the Court need not really reach those points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.250" offset="12184325">We think that this case is a square of search and seizure case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.294" offset="12200521">I don't mean I'm abandoning those points, I don't want to be misunderstood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.268" offset="12212433">But we do think that the basic issue in this case is whether or not the rights of these people under the Fourth Amendment were violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.735" offset="12238346">And we think that that's the issue on which it ought to be and should be decided in their favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.759" offset="12258408">The Government makes some arguments about -- about lack of possession, lack of claim of property on the part of these people, we think they are not irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.967" offset="12299264">We think that the mere fact that they were there is enough to give them standing to raise the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.957" offset="12319222">It certainly was enough for the trial judge to permit the introduction of the evidence against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.093" offset="12335731">That was the basis on which Judge Goodman offered the -- permitted the evidence against him to be received.</text>

            <text syncTime="3144.676" offset="12682115">I would like to briefly outline some facts of the case, the evidentiary facts which I feel should be born in mind with proper consideration of the legal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.526" offset="12725478">And to discuss an argument put forth by the Government to the effect that we do not feel this Court should reach the constitutional questions, the Fourth Amendment problem which been raised by petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.847" offset="12802800">Now, first with respect to some of the facts which were developed during the course of the trial, and these facts are set forth -- the facts that I am referring to are set forth on our brief from pages 6 through 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.623" offset="12861837">I'm just going to refer briefly to some of those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.137" offset="12883884">The evidence showed that Thompson, Steinberg, Ross and Coleman were all long-time into this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.820" offset="12918680">They all had offices in the same building at Communist Party headquarters in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.181" offset="12956087">On June 20, 1953, approximately two months prior to the arrest in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.617" offset="12989837">Petitioner Kremen using the false and fictitious name of Mrs. Lee Kaplan rented the cabin here involved in Twain Harte.</text>

            <text syncTime="3251.444" offset="13109164">The evidence showed that petitioner Steinberg identified himself to the owner of the cabin as Mr. Newberg and he referred to Mrs. Kremen as his sister.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.367" offset="13164857">Of course the evidence reflects that petitioner Steinberg not only is not the brother of Mrs. Kremen but he was not ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.520" offset="13213445">Mrs. Kremen said at the time of negotiating for rental of the premises that she liked the cabin because it was quiet and out of the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.427" offset="13277080">The evidence also show that the petitioner Steinberg seem to be the host or master of the cabin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.062" offset="13311666">On one occasion, he ordered Mrs. Kremen to pay a light bill to the owner of the cabin Mr. Germany.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.952" offset="13355133">Petitioner Kremen made several purchases, a large quantities of food from which an inference to be drawn that the food was for the purpose of feeding the two fugitives and the other people at the cabin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.552" offset="13413543">On one occasion, she and a male companion attempted to purchase hair dye, and in this connection, it is significant to note that Mr. Thompson at the time of his apprehension had dyed red hair and a dyed mustache.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.509" offset="13505390">The evidence also showed that on June 5, 1953 also about two months prior to the arrest in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.621" offset="13545827">The petitioner Coleman using the false and fictitious name or William Gordon purchased a Hudson automobile in Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.610" offset="13585847">And at the time of purchase, he explained that he needed the automobile in a hurry for a vacation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.740" offset="13614373">The keys to this automobile were found in Thompson's pocket when he was apprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.421" offset="13649063">On July 4th, Coleman still using the name of Gordon and Thompson were members of a party of four which rented boats at a resort in Bigfork, Montana, oh I'm sorry, in Camdenton, Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.621" offset="13725863">And during the early part of August, Thompson purchased a fishing license in Bigfork, Montana using the false name of J.F. Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.883" offset="13770898">At the time of his arrest, the evidence showed that he was in possession of various identification cards, I think 12 cards of different types, Social Security cards, fishing licenses and things to that sort under the false name of John F. Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.336" offset="13848743">There was nothing on his person at the time of the arest, nothing in the cabin to indicate that true identity of Thompson or of Steinberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.579" offset="13889703">Both of them were using fictitious names as were petitioners Coleman and Mrs. Kremen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.036" offset="13935470">At the time of the arrest also, both Thompson and petitioner Steinberg had altered their physical appearances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.547" offset="13981550">The evidence showed that Thompson had dyed his hair red.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.777" offset="14002448">He had gain much weight, had grown a mustache and that the mustache also was dyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.411" offset="14033063">Petitioner Steinberg had cut his hair short.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.723" offset="14050304">He had also grown a mustache and was much thinner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.803" offset="14090533">The evidence seized in the cabin also show that petitioner Kremen's purse contain various documents, means of identification in the name of Mrs. Lee Kaplan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.671" offset="14162108">There was no indication reflecting that the owner of the purse Mrs. Kremen actually was Mrs. Kremen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.466" offset="14201187">Now, going from that very brief outline of some of the evidence, it is our contention first that this Court should not reach the constitutional question raised under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.629" offset="14285928">The petitioners here were arrested in August of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.680" offset="14314141">In September of 1953 Mrs. Kremen claimed some of the property that was seized at the cabin and that property was returned to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.870" offset="14354892">I think it was referred to during the course of petitioner's argument and it is set forth in the appendix to petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.235" offset="14396270">I think beginning at page 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.468" offset="14421243">There is a notation that the following items were identified by Mrs. Kremen and returned to her on September 25 and those items consume four and a half pages of the appendix.</text>

            <text syncTime="4876.314" offset="19608639">But that is not so, because there was no positive identification by the arresting agents that Thompson, the person at the cabin was actually the Thompson that they were looking for or that Steinberg was the man they were looking for.</text>

            <text syncTime="5087.238" offset="20452289">And I think to require the arresting officers to go get a warrant for the other three people would not be permitting two arresting officers the degree of latitude which I think this Court has held should be accorded to persons who are daily in combat so to speak with the criminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5115.055" offset="20563571">It would be unrealistic it seems to me to require an officer coming across a situation such as this to go 60 miles or so to get a warrant before he makes the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5127.257" offset="20612368">The arrest -- the crime of harboring, reasonably and probably according to their observations were being committed in their presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5136.259" offset="20648417">And they had a right to determine and the circumstances of this case when to close the traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="5143.401" offset="20676942">Now, I think that in those circumstances and in light of the information known to the arresting officers, the arrests in this case were valid arrest based on reasonable and probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5161.481" offset="20749249">As this Court stated in the old case of Stacey v. Emery.</text>
            <text syncTime="5166.241" offset="20768371">The circumstances known to the officers must be such as to warrant a man of ordinary caution to believe or to entertain an honest and strong suspicion that the person is guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5178.784" offset="20818526">Certainly, from what the officers knew here, they could entertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="5183.768" offset="20838484">They believe the reasonable, honest and strong suspicion that these other three people at the cabin who had been there all night, who had not arrived in the cabin early in the morning who were obviously living with these two people were haroring those two people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5203.701" offset="20918209">Now, then to the -- going next from the proposition that the arrests were valid, this Court has held that pursuant to an incidental to an arrest, to a valid arrest, the person who was arrested and the place where he is arrested may be searched for the fruits of the crime, the tools of the crime or for weapons, contraband and like matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="5352.064" offset="21511607">Technically, I think in a very little sense, the cabin it self was a primary tool of the harboring process.</text>

            <text syncTime="5992.594" offset="24073697">This is the kind of thing that -- for all I know you and I would have done it -- I've been in -- we've been in their places.</text>
            <text syncTime="5998.627" offset="24097834">And I think from my point of view that's the vice of dealing with the problem in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6003.419" offset="24117060">The reasonableness with which -- by which this must be judged, the reasonableness must be projected against the Fourth Amendment which presupposes a fixed screw of requiring a warrant -- a search warrant, and a search warrant limited very specifically and subject to judicial determination to which there are these very narrow exceptions that we talk about and you talk about the tools of the crime as though there's some principle of law which is the starting point.</text>
            <text syncTime="6034.715" offset="24242239">Namely, you can grab everything that may deemed to be a tool of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="6039.202" offset="24260211">I can see that could be a wholly misconceive, misconception on the way of dealing with this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="6044.877" offset="24282885">You've got to start with the fact that it's prohibited and that the exception is a very narrow one, an extremely narrow one which had it's reason -- and reason namely you want -- for the safety of the arresting officers, you want to be sure that they haven't got a pistol of what not or a knife and secondly that he shouldn't go away with the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6065.740" offset="24366373">Now, if the reasonableness is restricted to those considerations, then we'll get a proper basis from which to judge these things instead of considering it, whether these are high-minded in inhumane law offices.</text>
