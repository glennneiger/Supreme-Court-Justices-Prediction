            <text syncTime="11.914" offset="47647">To continue my argument with regard to the Trop case, I'd like to first say that the authority for the Act of Congress, 401 subsection (g), consists of the war power, the power to regulate the Government of the armed forces, a power to raise and provide for the support of the armed forces and the Necessary and Proper Clause as it modifies those various powers.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="52.612" offset="210442">Was the power inherent?</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="54.776" offset="219011">I think there is an inherent power but I don't think it -- it has the same problem with regard to foreign affairs, in this case, that there is in Perez and Nishikawa and other cases before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.371" offset="289437">There's certainly the inherent power to conduct the affairs of the United States as a sovereign which is also present.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.136" offset="340532">Turning to the facts on page 4 of the transcript, I'd like to call briefly to the Court's attention the charge three that was involved in the court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.032" offset="412108">There, it has stated that the 1st Lieutenant Dirr (ph) testified that on May 23rd of the year 1944, and you will recall that this man escaped from confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.981" offset="471876">It wasn't as though he just left the Army as such.He was in confinement on his first escape on May 9th, 1944, that's uncontradicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.232" offset="520882">Then, after he was brought back on May 22nd, he again escaped and that was the time that the desertion charge was established against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.725" offset="578873">Now, in regard to what happened when he was found to have deserted, 1st Lieutenant Dirr (ph) testified that on May 23rd, he was in a truck going from Meknes to Rabat and saw plaintiff who was hold and I think that's typographical, it should be told him, he was from the hospital and he and a companion boarded the truck and were turned over to the military police in Rabat.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.542" offset="698096">Now, the next line, I think is important to our thinking about this charge of desertion and the seriousness of it.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="180.611" offset="722442">What was his statement, General, to the truck driver that he did what from the hospital?</text>

          <turn speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="187.814" stopTime="189.568">
            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="187.814" offset="751177">He was from the hospital.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="189.568" offset="758178">Oh, oh, just said he was from.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="191.033" stopTime="238.877">
            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="191.033" offset="764029">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.376" offset="769463">And he and a companion boarded the truck and were turned over to the military police in Rabat.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.425" offset="793600">They got in, the next sentence I think is quite important, they got in without any argument and made no attempt to leave the truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.439" offset="837695">Now, I don't seem to think that that language is open to the construction that they were just asked to be taken and voluntarily were going back to get straightened around with their unit because there wouldn't be any reason for saying that they got in without any argument and made no attempt to leave the truck if it was all voluntary at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.626" offset="954410">Then --</text>

            <text syncTime="245.099" offset="980323">I mean, when -- when they got into the -- to get them into the truck --</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="250.788" offset="1003102">Well, the language is --</text>

          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="250.856" stopTime="251.924">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="250.856" offset="1003416">-- did it say that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_lee_rankin" startTime="251.924" stopTime="561.614">
            <label>Mr. J. Lee Rankin</label>
            <text syncTime="251.924" offset="1007595">-- only that it -- they boarded the truck and were turned over to the military police in Rabat.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.829" offset="1035285">So, whether he was treating it as a custody, I can't tell from the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.700" offset="1058795">Then the Technical Sergeant Helen Alcock (ph) testified that she was in the truck and that plaintiff and another "willingly guarding the truck although nothing was said and that they were walking in the direction of Rabat" and then this is in the direction of Casablanca and away from Spanish Morocco.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.935" offset="1163703">Then the plaintiff himself said, "My organization is now in Italy," and I think that's very important in regard to the seriousness of this charge so that he had full knowledge of where his organization was at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.107" offset="1232353">â€œI thought it would be possible for me to rejoin my organization and there I might get a brigade commander that would reopen my case.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.135" offset="1272477">At the time that Lieutenant Dirr (ph) picked us up, we had decided to return to the stockade.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.041" offset="1296091">The going was tough.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.851" offset="1315318">We had no money to speak of, and at the time we were on foot and we were getting cold and hungry."</text>
            <text syncTime="336.510" offset="1346038">That's the end of the quote and that's all we have as to what was his purpose and intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.445" offset="1373727">But it doesn't appear that there's any clear intention, any repentance or clear intention to try to go back and straighten out his record and try to perform his duty as a citizen and get back into combat.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.665" offset="1430570">Now, if you take into account, in addition to that, the situation that was present, that the Court would take judicial notice of, in Italy in regard to the war, we find that the Axis forces had been defeated in Africa.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.620" offset="1514475">The fighting in Italy had proceeded and Naples was taken October 1st, 1943 but the offensive bogged down outside of Cassino, halfway between Naples and Rome where the Nazis had built there Gustav Line.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.113" offset="1596395">Now, the problem was to bypass this enemy stronghold and an attack was launched at Anzio on January 22nd, 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.963" offset="1651775">But the American and British troops were able only to maintain a beachhead there due to heavy Nazi bombing and shelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.469" offset="1681868">Of course, we're all familiar with the great losses that were suffered on that beachhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.243" offset="1700885">Throughout February, March and April of 1944, the Italian fronts remained stabilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.425" offset="1729620">It was only local actions taking place.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.642" offset="1742472">Then on May 11th, after several weeks of extensive air -- aerial bombardment, the allies launched their spring offensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.116" offset="1784372">Cassino was captured on May 18th, after tough and bitter fighting.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.869" offset="1807464">Now, if you relate those dates to that kind of condition in Italy, for he knew his unit was, and the threat to life, his life as well as all the others in his unit, to participating in that combat.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.897" offset="1867546">I think you get the picture as the court-martial looked at the situation when they examined this case and saw that this man was absent from confinement, first, and then about 13 days later, May 22nd, he was absent again.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.594" offset="1966289">And I think that the conclusion is very fair that it was for the purpose of avoiding this combat.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.878" offset="1995442">Now, you take into account the shortage of manpower that we had in this country and the demands that were being met -- being made upon our armed forces, wherever they were situated in the world, and the great need for manpower seems to me you also must take into account the fact that under this provision of Section 401 (g), it was provided first that before you come to the proviso, there was an opportunity for the man to proceed before he was -- got to the place where there isn't dishonorable discharge and perform his obligation of citizenship by going -- satisfying his superiors in going back to his unit and participating in combat like many others did, who were also involved in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.387" offset="2225528">So, being absent and desertion and --</text>

            <text syncTime="561.614" offset="2246426">General, is there anything in the record that would fairly support the conclusion that he was deserting to the enemy?</text>

            <text syncTime="1664.175" offset="6656627">There is a judicial hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.656" offset="6670524">In this particular case, there would be no issue of fact to be determined at the hearing, the identity of the individual being conceded.</text>
