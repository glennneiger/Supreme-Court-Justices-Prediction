            <label>Mr. Morton Hollander</label>
            <text syncTime="9.842" offset="142712">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.282" offset="148459">This case like Number 19 originated as an action by the carrier, Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway, against the United States in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.608" offset="205824">There, too, the claim was that the county had not been paid enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.918" offset="235081">This is -- this is the factual situation in -- in Number 19, Chesapeake &amp; Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.944" offset="271130">In December, late December 1941 right after Pearl Harbor and in the early part of the next month, January 1942, the Government moved over Chesapeake &amp; Ohio's lines approximately 50 carloads of military automative equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.909" offset="371022">The destination for these military supplies was China.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.418" offset="405086">It was to be shipped to China through Rangoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.705" offset="430164">For the domestic leg of the movement, the goods were transported from their point of origin, Pontiac, Michigan, to the seaport at Newport News whence there were supposed to be shipped through Rangoon to China.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.876" offset="518875">Prior to the movement of these 50 carloads of military supplies from Pontiac to Newport News, the Government had made all the necessary arrangements through the Office of Defense Transportation which coordinated all domestic rail and overseas ship traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.421" offset="605080">They had made arrangements through the ODT.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.074" offset="615633">They had obtained the necessary releases.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.110" offset="623783">They had assured themselves a sufficient cargo or vessel space at the Newport News destination at the seaport from which they were going to be shipped to Rangoon and then to China.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.993" offset="683342">The goods were at -- the goods arrived at Newport News in due course.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.052" offset="703613">They were there for a matter of two or three weeks when -- on March 8 -- March 8, 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.014" offset="735378">March 8, 1942, Rangoon fell to the Japanese.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.388" offset="764949">So this, of course, made it impossible for the Government to ship the goods from the overseas port at Newport News onto China.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.884" offset="822941">The goods were -- at that time moved to inland storage centers where they stayed for approximately two or three months and then a year later, they were transshipped across the United States to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.111" offset="895770">And at that point from that port from Wilmington, California, they were exported to India.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.797" offset="938611">The tariff rate question in this case arises --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="212.877" offset="954911">In connection with the -- in connection with the war also?</text>

            <label>Mr. Morton Hollander</label>
            <text syncTime="216.993" offset="971316">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.751" offset="974346">They were shipped back in the middle of 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.244" offset="1000364">The tariff rate question in this case arises with respect to the movement, the original movement from Pontiac, Michigan to the original overseas port, Newport News, where the overseas transportation was frustrated by the fall of Rangoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.029" offset="1063476">The carrier claims that they are entitled to the higher domestic rate which applies to a shipment of that sort because they say the goods did not leave the United States from Newport News, the original consignment port.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.495" offset="1153337">The Government's position in this -- in this litigation has been that -- now, it's -- it's unfair, it's unreasonable to apply the high domestic rate in a case of this sort where the overseas exportation has been frustrated by war or by any other circumstance beyond the shipper's control.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.734" offset="1230346">The Government insisted that the lower export rate should apply, a rate considerably less than the domestic rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.180" offset="1260126">The Government, in other words, contented that the lower export rate for the movement from -- in Pontiac, Michigan to Newport News should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.439" offset="1293145">The record -- the record shows very clearly that these goods would have followed through on the original plan and have been exported from Newport News to Rangoon to China had not -- Burma had been conquered by the Japanese in March of 1942.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="317.771" offset="1374438">But I understand you that -- that here the -- those are export rates are fixed if your -- the goods, the Government started some goods, intended to be exported but they were not exported and the Government has finally get the benefit of the export rate?</text>

            <label>Mr. Morton Hollander</label>
            <text syncTime="335.484" offset="1445282">Yes, Your Honor, that is precisely the -- the basic issue on the tariff rate question in both the District Court and in -- and in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.871" offset="1490840">The --</text>

            <label>Justice Harold Burton</label>
            <text syncTime="347.802" offset="1494601">Suppose they had never been exported to India, would that make any difference?</text>

          <turn speaker="morton_hollander" startTime="352.189" stopTime="390.787">
            <label>Mr. Morton Hollander</label>
            <text syncTime="352.189" offset="1512155">The Government's position is that these subsequent events occurring after the goods arrived at the original consignment port have no bearing on the Government's eligibility for the export rate on the initial shipment because the Government certainly had a bonafide intent to export that's conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.311" offset="1588642">The Government had made all the necessary arrangements, had taken all -- had taken all possibly diligent precautions to assure itself a vessel space from Newport News to Rangoon only the -- the only factor of frustrating the shipment was the circumstance completely beyond its control.</text>

            <text syncTime="390.787" offset="1666487">What additional burdens with the railroads put to on that change of situation?</text>

            <label>Mr. Morton Hollander</label>
            <text syncTime="396.094" offset="1687698">None -- none whatsoever, Your Honor, none whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.707" offset="1702222">The ICC in fact because of that has consistently ruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.122" offset="1719881">It's consistently ruled that in circumstances of this sort where the shipper exercises reasonable diligence to assure himself of adequate cargo space at the consignment port and where the shipment does not move overseas because of some circumstance beyond his control like war, the Africa war in 1939 is the first ICC case we rely on.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.769" offset="1810474">The goods were completely domesticated there.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.461" offset="1821236">They never did go overseas from any port.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.523" offset="1833462">They remained in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.237" offset="1840358">The ICC has consistently ruled that when you have those two factors, you have a bonafide intent to export, you have reasonable diligence in assuring necessary cargo space prior to the time the goods move out over the rails to the consignment port.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.315" offset="1892603">In -- in those -- in that situation, the ICC has consistently ruled that it is unreasonable, it is unfair to the shipper to require him to pay the higher domestic rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.512" offset="1933458">Now, we relied on those ICC rulings in the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.078" offset="1955715">We said that on the basis of those ICC rulings, we were entitled to a ruling from the Court, the District Court and the Court of Appeals, that we should have to pay no more than the export rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.790" offset="2010572">We further contended in the courts below that if the Court was not ready to give full effect for the Commission decisions on unreasonableness of application of the high domestic rate in these circumstances, if the Court was not ready to give effect to those Commission decisions, then we requested the Court to stay the proceedings, refer the question of reasonableness of application of these high domestic rates to these frustrated freight shipments, refer that question to the Interstate Commerce Commission and await administrative Commerce Commission's resolution of that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.260" offset="2176397">What the court below did was to say that they were to view that they were not ready to apply the ICC decisions on unreasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.334" offset="2236688">In fact as they saw it, as they read those decisions, it was perfectly permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.908" offset="2259048">There was nothing unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.664" offset="2266049">The court below ruled in applying the higher domestic rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.626" offset="2285902">With respect to our request that the proceedings be stayed so as to afford us an opportunity to go before the Commission, have the Commission itself apply its own rulings unreasonableness for the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.061" offset="2335640">There, the Court of Appeals too raised its hand like the Court of Claims did in number 9 -- in number 18 and said, “We're very sorry, very sorry, two-year period of limitations has gone by.”</text>
            <text syncTime="571.773" offset="2390497">The Commission has that power to entertain any referral and we will not refer the case to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.272" offset="2420485">Now, in the -- the date sequence in -- in the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio case is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.662" offset="2445981">The shipments as I pointed out were made in 1941, later part of December 1941 and early of January 1942, the shipments in question, that is the movement from Pontiac, Michigan to the Newport News.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.942" offset="2495091">The Government defected -- and the -- the carriers billed the Government at the high domestic rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.676" offset="2530095">In compliance with the mandate of the Transportation Act of 1940, the Government made prompt payment of those high domestic rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.372" offset="2560815">The GAO was in a position to audit these bills in 1946, approximately four years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.225" offset="2600312">At that time, GAO determined that there was an overcharge that we should have paid only the export rate and effected recoupment by deductions from other bills submitted by Chesapeake &amp; Ohio in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.551" offset="2665618">Six years later, 1952, almost exactly six years later after these deductions were effected in the record, and this case is very clear, Chesapeake &amp; Ohio comes into court, into the District Court and contests the correctness of the deduction, the -- the GAO's position that there had been an alleged overpayment when they initially received payment on the basis a higher domestic rate.</text>

            <label>Mr. Morton Hollander</label>
            <text syncTime="667.772" offset="2774497">There, as in this case, the carrier -- there as in the earlier case, the carrier waited for more than two years to go by, then it could, as the Court of Appeals in this case ruled and as the Court of Claims in the earlier case held, it was in a position to deprive the Government of its right and actually to -- to establish its defense of unreasonableness of application of the domestic rates to these shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.802" offset="2902601">The -- the Government's hands were tied under the opinion of the Court of Appeals, the passage of that two-year period of time while barring the right of the Government to obtain a referral in no way affects the carrier's right to file a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.243" offset="2956309">The carrier could come as much as six years later, lot of carriers come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.870" offset="2970833">However, the fact that the two-year period of limitations prescribed by Section 16 (3) of Interstate Commerce Act had elapsed -- had elapsed that the time the carrier came into court.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.828" offset="3014719">That fact prevented the Government as a shipper, as a defendant from going to the ICC to establish the unreasonableness of the rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.396" offset="3048991">In other words, under the opinions of both of these courts, it is up to the plaintiff carrier to dictate and to control the type of defense which may be asserted by the Government as a shipper defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.668" offset="3114088">The carrier has no such right of control or the case with respect to the private shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.879" offset="3134882">As far as the private shipper is concerned, the carrier is forced to come into court within two years to file its -- its complaint against the shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.324" offset="3168632">And as I pointed out earlier, even if the carrier as far as the private shipper is concerned, waits until the very last day of that two-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.534" offset="3201546">The expiration of that two-year period does not bar the shipper from getting before the ICC on a case arising out of the same transportation service because Section 16 (3) (b) of the Act explicitly gives the shipper an additional 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.718" offset="3266226">If the carrier should wait until the last day of the two-year period, then the shipper is accorded an additional 90-day period beyond the expiration of two-year period within which he can take advantage of a proceeding before the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.643" offset="3317948">That admiral relief is not open to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.944" offset="3327143">As I say in this case as in the earlier case, it is up to the carrier that the whim of the carrier, if the carrier wants to collect unreasonable charges from the United States as a shipper, if it wants to collect these unreasonable charges, all it have to do under both of these opinions is wait for the two-year period to go by, then file suit against the Government and the Government is -- is completely barred from asserting its defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="856.846" offset="3530794">And Congress has reserved to the Government the explicit right of recoupment by deductions of overpayments from later bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.111" offset="3559842">And I think it would be quite appropriate for the Interstate Commerce Commission to say that the -- the Government hasn't exercised the statutory right conferred upon it by Congress.</text>
