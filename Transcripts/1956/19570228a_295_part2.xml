            <label>Ms. Pearl M. Hart</label>
            <text syncTime="12.106" offset="151803">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.294" offset="164551">I would like to say at the threshold that it is all together likely that this case would not be before Your Honors and I would not be here this afternoon if I had advised my client to plead the Fifth Amendment in relation to the questions which were asked of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.188" offset="236126">But the integrity of the client and devotion to the proper administration of the law did not permit us to indulge in any subterfuges.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.532" offset="281475">And therefore, whatever answers we refuse to give, our position was that the questions were in violation of our rights under the First Amendment and also that the questions were not pertinent to any issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.356" offset="344795">And we feel that we have a complete right to protection for ourselves under the First Amendment just as much as we have under any other amendment to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.352" offset="404773">I would like to say too that briefly on the question of the right of supervision because that's the point, I think, in which we left that the kind of supervision attempted here would be all together feudal under almost any circumstances that we can conceive.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.034" offset="479483">For instance, if this defendant, when called upon by the person in the Naturalization Service, had bared his life completely from the cradle to the present time and had told all about himself, and nevertheless said, "Yes, I still am a member of the Communist Party and I still go to meetings of the Communist Party."</text>
            <text syncTime="119.292" offset="580524">What assistance would that had been to the Attorney General in the so-called supervision or what could the Attorney General have done having that information before him?</text>
            <text syncTime="131.627" offset="629844">On the other hand, suppose the defendant had taken the position that he refused to answer on the basis of the Fifth Amendment, how would the Attorney General have been assisted in this so-called supervision of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.697" offset="686164">In neither event, would anything happen then, it would have been a feudal act as far as the order supervision is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.515" offset="721481">And while that should not be determinative of the entire proposition, nevertheless, on the mere argument of the supervision, it gets the Court nowhere in my opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.934" offset="775084">Another matter to which I want to call your attention preliminarily is this, that there is nothing in the indictment and the indictment has to be considered, I believe, by this Court from its four corners.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.471" offset="829210">There's nothing in the indictment which has any reference at all to Communist Party membership or engaging in Communist and activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.052" offset="867558">It is a general indictment which says that the defendant who is then and there and the alien against whom an order of deportation had issued and been outstanding for more than six months, which said order of deportation was then and there, a final order having become final on a certain day and who is the project from the United States under the order of deportation had not been affected with in such six-month period and who was then and there pending eventual deportation subject to supervision was required to come in and answer questions, et cetera and he refused to answer the following questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.180" offset="1000051">Now, are we to assume, and I'm not making a great point over because I suppose you might as well meet the whole situation squarely, are we to assume from this that all of these matters in relation to Communist Party activity are pertinent to this particular kind of an indictment because there's nothing in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.605" offset="1073821">Now then, they proceed to give the questions which it was said he refused to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.439" offset="1097122">And the first question you will notice is, "Do you subscribe to the Daily Worker?"</text>
            <text syncTime="253.727" offset="1118229">I would like to tell you, and that does happened to be part of the record, that the question which immediately preceeded it was, "Do you rate the Chicago Daily Tribune?"</text>
            <text syncTime="264.041" offset="1159502">Well, of course, we objected to answering that under the First Amendment just the same as we objected to answering in regard to the Daily Worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.503" offset="1189386">However, we're not being embedded for not answering as to whether we read the Daily Tribune or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.415" offset="1217076">All of these questions -- I think there are 22 questions contained in the indictment which we --</text>

            <text syncTime="1168.920" offset="4779029">And as a matter of fact, the Court held that the Court have a right to review the discretion of the Attorney General in refusing bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.962" offset="4823228">After the six-month period is over, the deportee may not be held under bail but he has to be discharged and the practice is, in all of these cases, that his bail has returned to him and he goes home but he's called in to sign if he will and most of the time, he won't, a supervisory parole agreement under which these various things are set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.325" offset="4932629">And the law provides that he has to submit to physical and psychiatric examination at the discretion of the Attorney General that he may not associate with persons who are Communist and originally the supervisory agreement even included a wife but they have made an exception since that, if the Court please.</text>

            <text syncTime="1634.214" offset="6640201">Now, I should say through Your Honors too that in St. Louis, the Zedner case is gradually coming up this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.304" offset="6676564">The Zedner case was a civil proceeding in which it was attempted to enjoin the Attorney General from restricting people as to their movements from requiring them to report at certain times, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.354" offset="6728808">And the Court, it was a three-judge Court, ruled as to several of these restrictions that they were improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.275" offset="6764440">And the Government has appealed from that and Mrs. Zedner herself has also entered a cross-appeal in relation to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.242" offset="6808325">But in that situation, there isn't so very much danger.</text>

            <text syncTime="1680.099" offset="6823790">Because it's just a civil proceeding and it may be determined favorably to the petitioner or may not but at least there's no question about the person's liberty being lost to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.570" offset="6885648">Here, we have a working man who earns $72 or $82 a week with a family of five, who has to put up a $4000 bond on this indictment, who had to engage counsel to represent him and counsels here and it has been placed through all of these expense and great insecurity and great inconvenience because of a statute which, on its face to me at least, is strangely vague and strangely lacking insufficient notice to the defendant for him to know what is required of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.816" offset="7054608">It's a new crime which Congress tried to create.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.633" offset="7073938">Nothing like this has ever been before this Court before because the law was only enacted in 1950, I believe, and it's a case of first impression, I -- I make them as far as this Court is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.543" offset="7129527">Now, I have briefly covered what I feel is relevant under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.556" offset="7173622">What we read, whom we see, where we go, what we talk about are things which may not be revealed under circumstances such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.935" offset="7227120">Take a situation where a person is asked or is requested to testify either before a grand jury or before a court and refuses for some reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.978" offset="7271320">He may be held in contempt, but most of the time, he is given an opportunity to purge himself of that contempt by saying that he will testify and by so testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.171" offset="7320012">In this situation, we have nothing, no opening left to the defendant at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.143" offset="7347911">He says he will not testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.242" offset="7356374">There is no possibility of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.274" offset="7364420">There's nobody in the immigration service who has a right to review this situation, merely because some subordinate, sometimes unjustified, I believe, in calling him an under length.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.564" offset="7413635">Some person asks some questions which cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be regarded as pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.576" offset="7445713">We are immediately subject to indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.054" offset="7463581">That of itself, I think, ought to be a sufficient consideration for a court in relation to the right of the Attorney General to require a person to testify under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.793" offset="7522513">I've already shown in relation to other situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.730" offset="7554278">May I call the attention to the fact of testifying before congressional committee?</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.959" offset="7579251">There you have the protection by the law itself which says we are required to testify to those things which are pertinent to the matter which the Committee is investigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.837" offset="7622719">Here, there is nothing at all, not only is they have nothing to say it's pertinent, but the breadth given to the Attorney General is absolutely without any scope at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.852" offset="7670784">He can go as far as he likes and the only way you can test it is to have yourself indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.737" offset="7710281">One of the questions which I think is of serious import here is the manner of the procedure or the method -- matter of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.438" offset="7753122">The question was raised somewhat in the case of the United States versus Spector.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.481" offset="7785305">There -- there was involved, if the Court please, the question of proceeding on an indictment without proof of the tax leading up to the situation except that of an administrative order of the immigration service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.979" offset="7867329">In that particular case, it was said that if that question had been raised, it might have been considered but it wasn't raised there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.311" offset="7900662">And therefore, we are asking to have a right to raise it here and that does constitute a constitutional issue or one of the constitutional issues, what have we here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.991" offset="7947368">On -- an order of deportation entered by an administrative agency without really the protections of the Administrative Procedures Act, even though there is a review by the Board of Immigration Appeals, an order of deportation so entered becomes the basis for a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.957" offset="8063248">It's contrary in my opinion to the constitutional guarantee to have a right to face your witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.852" offset="8094804">You have a right to cross-examine your witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.513" offset="8109432">You have a right to subpoena them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.062" offset="8119672">Under this proposal, a mere order of an administrative agency without more forms the basis of a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.236" offset="8176306">Now, I'm aware of the Yakus case and I'm aware of the Cox case and some of the other selective servicemen's cases which say that I'm an order of a draft court, a criminal indictment can be brought here, all you have to do is to introduce the order of the draft court to justify such a proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.964" offset="8255195">But, Your Honors, there's a great distinction again because take, for instance, the Yakus case, that had to do with rates during the war emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.389" offset="8304933">It was a strong opinion written by the majority with a strong dissent as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.768" offset="8334399">But in that particular situation, the defendants, are those who were indicted, did not avail themselves of the right of review under the emergency Court of Appeals and that was one of the reasons before the fact that the Court held that under such a situation an indictment could be proceeded upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.514" offset="8417468">Now, the selective service cases are so totally different from this sort of a situation because there, every possible protective device by way of review is thrown about a candidate for the draft, so that he has an opportunity at various stages of the proceedings to show why he should not be drafted if he wants to or to have his situation reviewed so that he doesn't come into a court in this kind of a situation totally liking of and totally naked as to any protection to which he might be entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.057" offset="8575561">A person is indicted for robbery, for any crime at all and everybody who is a witness or who can be a witness must come in to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.276" offset="8628433">In this sort of a proceeding, all of the facts leading up to the order of deportation of which are gathered together in really a quite informal way are reduced to an order and that order that mere slip of paper constitutes the witnesses to the right of the Government to deport.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.334" offset="8720697">And on the basis of that mere slip of paper, the Government may proceed on this kind of indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.793" offset="8746506">I think that's definitely contrary to any kind of Anglo-Saxon criminal jurisprudence because it definitely deprives a person of the right to face his accusers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.216" offset="8800214">And there's nothing we can do about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.977" offset="8811290">That matter has not been disposed of by this Honorable Court and I sincerely hope that it might have consideration because it -- it's permissible in this kind of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.483" offset="8865311">Other situations will develop where it will also be permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.425" offset="8881089">And on that way by gradual process, those rights which we consider as belonging to us under the constitutional authority are gradually be eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.612" offset="8953814">I have touched briefly on the right of an individual not to have his right of locomotion interfered with as it is in this kind of a situation under this kind of a parole agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.659" offset="9017971">And I think freedom to which a person is entitled to and an alien has the same rights under the Constitution as a native and that too is elementary and I shouldn't take time to say it under that kind of a situation, an alien who is resident here now merely because the Attorney General can't find the place to send him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.360" offset="9108773">He should not be restricted in any way at all in his convict except to report for deportation when it is necessary or when it becomes possible to deport him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.447" offset="9153181">To do anything else is to punish him for being an alien because we don't punish other people who are not aliens in relation to this kind of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.192" offset="9200097">And there's authority, I think, for the position I take and the authority that's cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.622" offset="9225906">Another matter which occurs to me in connection with that situation is whether or not the Attorney General has a right to any of this at all under the Tenth Amendment because out of the Tenth Amendment, a department of the Government or an official of the Government only has those rights which are proper and necessary to carry out whatever other rights he has.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.458" offset="9325171">Now, what right has the Attorney General here other than to deport this individual?</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.631" offset="9353906">He has none at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.185" offset="9364146">Supervision, if you call it that, only consists, in my humble opinion, of knowing where he is, so he may be deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.586" offset="9401762">But on the question of supervision and making him behave in doing the right things after his ordered deported, you have the laws of 48 countries, the 48 states which determined what his conduct should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.453" offset="9453171">You have the laws of the Federal Government which determine what his conduct should be.</text>

            <text syncTime="2389.426" offset="9661106">The Carlson case is distinguished by me in only this way that the burden of that case is what rights the Attorney General has in relation to a deportee or prospective deportee for a period of six months subsequent to the order of deportation and not beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.020" offset="9751489">Now, the Carlson case arose because a person was denied bail by the Court and by the Attorney General during that six-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.291" offset="9796524">The case holds that the Attorney General has not an untrammeled right to hold without that that his discretion is subject to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.705" offset="9842186">And that particular feature of the Carlson case is also reviewed by Mr. Justice Clark in the Mezei case where he says that when they hold that the Attorney General may hold for a short period of time for the purpose of affecting deportation but it doesn't go any further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.529" offset="9957439">Now, the law at the present time is this that if he cannot affect deportation within six months, he's got to release the deportee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.940" offset="9991084">And he has to return his bail to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.466" offset="10001220">Now, is the man a better man after six months?</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.514" offset="10017416">Is he a worst man after six months?</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.944" offset="10027133">It's simply the question of what is -- of what the law provides and what is reasonable under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.087" offset="10055764">The Carlson case, I say, relates only to the first six months subsequent to the order of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.522" offset="10085439">And thereafter, it has no bearing except that it says the Attorney General has certain rights which are reviewable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2502.348" offset="10112815">Well, the language in the Carlson case that the Government relies on, as I understand it, is that in fixing bail during that preview for -- or the pre-six month period, they can -- the judge can take into account among other things the fact during the national security which would seem to have no relationship to the availability of the man as a deportee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.647" offset="10229948">And it's that language that I would suppose that you – you wanted to deal with.</text>
