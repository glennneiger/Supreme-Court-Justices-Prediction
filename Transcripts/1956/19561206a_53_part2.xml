            <text syncTime="10.641" offset="145951">As I stated before lunch, the only evidence against the petitioner to establish that he had committed this crime was his confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.714" offset="186180">The prosecutrix had testified that she had awakened to find a man sitting on her chest and he's had a towel draped over his head and they've had a lengthy struggle throughout this apartment that traveled over a distance more than 40 feet and she grabbed the knife from him and (Inaudible) from the apartment but she was never able to identify him.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.175" offset="252113">And consequently, the only -- and she so testified at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.153" offset="264025">The only evidence against the petitioner was his confession with this exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.824" offset="282624">As I stated, petitioner was indicted for at least six crimes and he had been tried for another one prior to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.694" offset="314180">The one which he had been tried was an actual case of rape, not attempted rape, but this one was.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.416" offset="337063">And he had been convicted but he was sentenced merely to 99 years and not to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.630" offset="357857">In this case, the prosecutrix who had testified in the first case testified in this case to the effect that she has been raped as evidence of the fact that this was a kind of man who would commit rapes and therefore, the burglary was with intent to rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.097" offset="423790">The petitioner in this case is a Negro, 27 years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.784" offset="442493">He was a service station attendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.723" offset="454301">He had entered the first grade when he was eight years of age and had graduated from the third grade when he was 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.284" offset="480528">There was testimony, if I may quote, that he was "thickheaded" and three psychiatrists testified that he was severely, mentally ill and had been for some time and they diagnosed the illness as something in the nature of schizophrenia.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.762" offset="546461">He was arrested by a civilian, not a police officer, while walking in an alley in a so-called White section of Selma which in fact is about a block or so from the so-called Negro section.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.546" offset="601527">And while, apparently doing nothing illegal whatsoever, a civilian grabbed him and with three other White men stuck him in an automobile to awake the police whom they -- whom they called.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.040" offset="655548">The police took him, arrested him on suspicion, and they did not as is required by Alabama law for the extraordinary case of a civilian arrest, they did not take him before a magistrate and indeed, this is not only required by the Alabama law, but this is the custom, the record shows, of the City of Selma when a man is arrested within the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.350" offset="760769">There are some evidence that if a man is arrested outside of a city, a different type of warrant is used and he is not necessarily taken for magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.603" offset="789817">But for someone in the shoes of petitioner, not only the law but the custom was to take him immediately before the recorder.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.071" offset="827643">He was arrested on a few minutes after midnight on a Sunday and although shortly after his arrest, the day after, he saw the Sheriff of another County and his employer, for what purpose is not stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.911" offset="886993">He was -- the following day, taken to Kilby state prison, a distance of 50 miles from Selma where he was kept as the Warden of Kilby testified a “safe keeper.”</text>
            <text syncTime="208.720" offset="938297">And as a “safe keeper,” the warden testified, he is not our prisoner, so we never feel like we can let anyone see him without getting an okay from the man who was charged of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.145" offset="983960">If a man does identify himself as a lawyer, we will do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.074" offset="995662">We will go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.873" offset="1002872">But the record shows that when a lawyer came to see the petitioner during the period he was at Kilby, he was not permitted to see him.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.013" offset="1047385">The lawyer came there, there's no evidence that he's been retained.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.443" offset="1057102">He said he'd heard of the case and he wanted to see petitioner because he didn't believe he was guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.306" offset="1076642">The warden testified at first that he didn't know he was a lawyer and then he admitted that he did know he was a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.711" offset="1106213">Then he said, “Well, he hadn't given me his address.”</text>
            <text syncTime="253.557" offset="1117602">And then when finally asked --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="255.235" stopTime="256.146">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="255.235" offset="1124289">He hadn't what?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="256.146" stopTime="358.492">
            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="256.146" offset="1127946">Given me his address.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.423" offset="1133066">The lawyer hadn't given his address.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.170" offset="1140067">He did testify that he did know him and know of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.386" offset="1152920">And then finally, he said that -- when asked why after the confession a lawyer was admitted without anymore identification or anymore question and during this period of time, he said that -- that -- he was our prisoner then and we can let him see anybody we like.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.351" offset="1228779">The reason for taking him to Kilby was allegedly for protection, for safe keeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.062" offset="1255633">But the record shows that there were other people in the Selma Jail who were suspected of similar crimes and there were no more reason for the public to be incensed against one prisoner than against another.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.503" offset="1309341">There were -- and in fact, there was a -- there were no threats.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.912" offset="1327000">There was no basis for believing that either anybody outside of the jail or anyone inside the jail was going to do any harm to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.111" offset="1367855">When he was taken to Kilby, he was kept in solitary.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.631" offset="1385932">The word was "segregation" but at any rate, he was kept in solitude and he was kept there for at least a period of 10 days during which 10 days he rendered the two confessions that are at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.831" offset="1442670">During the first five days, he was questioned intermittently, some of the periods of questioning, being as long as three and a half hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.324" offset="1480704">On one of the days, he was not questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.085" offset="1487705">He was just permitted to be by himself in his solitary cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.677" offset="1506095">At the end of five days, by the States' own testimony and its own admission, he was questioned a minimum of 20 hours.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="358.492" offset="1537337">Is there any evidence of brutality?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="360.810" stopTime="745.957">
            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="360.810" offset="1546637">There is no evidence of brutality, Your Honor, and in fact, the Police Chief who questioned him stated that prior to commencing each question in session, he advised the prisoner of his constitutional rights and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.658" offset="1602017">The -- when I say a minimum of 20 hours, the States' testimony is in such term, well we questioned him for several hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.775" offset="1638484">I have interpreted several as two.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.104" offset="1647783">It could -- certainly more than one and it could readily be in -- well, in excess of two, certainly three or four, but I have made the minimum interpretation of the word "several."</text>
            <text syncTime="400.724" offset="1706297">The -- this is the uncontradicted testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.998" offset="1715388">In addition, there is some conflicting testimony that one questioning session was at least nine hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.595" offset="1737749">This testimony was in a newspaper story in the Selma newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.770" offset="1758438">And when the newspaper left and took the stand, he testified that he got the information from the police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.370" offset="1780903">However, later on in the trial when he was interrogated by the State on this, he testified that he had just made the figure of nine hours up out of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.437" offset="1821132">But the non-conflicting testimony is at least 20 hours during this period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.325" offset="1844642">The end of 10 days -- at the end of five days, one confession was obtained and it was tape-recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.279" offset="1872436">At the end of 10 days, another confession was obtained and this second confession was obtained again on the basis of the States' testimony following at least 27 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.931" offset="1927084">That is not 27 hours since the fifth day, but from the first day.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.914" offset="1943071">A minimum, at least 27 hours of interrogation, he was in the state prison at that point, 10 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.442" offset="1977135">On Thursday, the day he rendered the tape-recorded confession, his father drove 50 miles to Kilby to see him, but his father was unable to see him on Thursday and finally did get in to see him on Sunday after the first confession but before the second confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.269" offset="2076400">The State appears to find some significance in the fact that he was told of his rights before each session or at least so the -- so the police officer testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.811" offset="2138572">Petitioner's position that a mere pro forma recitation of constitutional rights to a petitioner such as this is not the adequate procedural protection that the constitution requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.418" offset="2189040">I believe it was in Haley versus Ohio that the opinion of the Court referred to such a merely pro forma recitations of your right to counsel and your right to remain silent and so forth, and noting that in the absence of some more tangible evidence of actual protection of petitioner's right, such as taking him before a magistrate and so forth as required by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.940" offset="2283081">Well, that was -- did not remove the evidence, the conclusion of coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.918" offset="2315055">In addition to which, this petitioner, a graduate of the third grade at age 16 and at least severely mentally ill, is not a person who could be deemed to be adequately protected by a recitation to him by a police officer what his constitutional rights were.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.922" offset="2407111">In summary, on this particular point of the confession issue, we have a case in which the prosecutrix was the daughter of a very important person in the community, the mayor's daughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.173" offset="2456116">The police testified that they were under unusual pressure to solve the crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.513" offset="2473462">The petitioner is a Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.710" offset="2482239">He was obviously terrified by the civilian arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.683" offset="2494151">If one is frightened by an arrest by the police, at least there is the thought that perhaps he'll be brought to a police station and things will then start running there in normal and proper course but I -- a civilian arrest that petitioner submits is a far more terrifying experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.526" offset="2565517">He was arrested originally on suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.467" offset="2573249">Either there was no compliance with the Alabama law or in indeed the custom of the City of Selma.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.512" offset="2593416">He was driven out to the state penitentiary, where -- were not being interrogated.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.236" offset="2612328">He was kept in solitary and he was questioned from 20 to 27 hours prior to the first and second confessions respect -- respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.099" offset="2655796">And as -- not mute, but really articulate evidence of the -- the nature of this confession, we can really turn to the confession itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.270" offset="2708459">And on page 233 of the record, there is -- commencing on 232, there is the tape-recorded confession taken at Kilby, the first one after the fifth day.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.214" offset="2760182">And there's the captain of the police force interrogating the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.353" offset="2776795">And at about the eighth or ninth line down, the captain says, “Now, how did you get into that house, William?”</text>
            <text syncTime="676.884" offset="2810859">And William says, “Er, I went around to the side window and took a piece of wire and open the screen and come through that.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.717" offset="2842206">And the captain says, “In what kind of room were you in then?”</text>
            <text syncTime="688.153" offset="2855999">And he hesitates and says, “I was in a -- er.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.569" offset="2869687">“At this point, if I may interpolate, it's essential to the State's case to show he came into the bedroom window because the bedroom window is the window through which the prosecutrix testified the entry was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.775" offset="2914513">And so he says -- repeats again after the petitioner hesitates, “What kind of room was it, William?</text>
            <text syncTime="709.004" offset="2939382">Do you remember?”</text>
            <text syncTime="710.190" offset="2944084">And he begins to say, “I was in the kitchen.”</text>
            <text syncTime="711.808" offset="2950562">He says a part of the word kitchen, but he doesn't get the word out entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.724" offset="2970311">And the police officer says, “In a bedroom with a child?”</text>
            <text syncTime="720.325" offset="2984626">And the petitioner queries bedroom and then the captain of police goes on as if it were a bedroom saying, “Now, who was in that bedroom, William?”</text>
            <text syncTime="728.361" offset="3016808">And then William repeats, “The baby,” and so forth and the confession goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.563" offset="3033631">Petitioner submits that in the light of all the circumstances that have been related that is persuasive evidence of the coerciveness of the confession.</text>

            <text syncTime="889.526" offset="3661511">In the Stein case, the defendants were -- this Court held hardened criminals who during the give and take of the confession gave very adequate evidence of their ability to take care of their rights as a reference to the -- the bargain they were driving to -- before they agree to confess.</text>

            <text syncTime="1027.499" offset="4213321">In that first case, the prosecutrix testified that she had been raped and he was convicted and he was sentenced not to death as had been requested by the State but to 99 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.617" offset="4269850">Now in this case, which involves burglary with attempt to rape, there's no charge of rape in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.654" offset="4297958">The only other testimony apart from the confession is the testimony of the prosecutrix in the first case, now being used here to get the death penalty they couldn't get in the first case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1171.461" offset="4789164">Now, the Supreme Court of Alabama on this point held on page 350 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.105" offset="4827826">If he proposed to testify to facts showing that the confession was unduly influenced, he certainly ought to respond to questions as to his guilt in fact and to any matter relevant thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.218" offset="4888221">Two judges of the Supreme Court of Alabama disagreed on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.074" offset="4907656">They stated that I cannot agree with that part of the opinion holding that the defendant was not entitled to testify as to the facts and circumstances concerning an alleged confession without thereby subjecting himself to cross-examination as to matters pertaining to his guilt or innocence, sanity or insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.668" offset="4994069">And there is -- therefore, no question as to what the offer was and to what the ruling of the trial court was and to what the interpretation of it was in the Supreme Court of Alabama as there has been in some other cases in which this issue has arisen but has been held not to have been sufficiently mature to be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.146" offset="5095946">The Alabama Supreme Court also pointed out that notwithstanding a state statute which relieves counsel of the necessity of informing the Court in detail of what testimony would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.140" offset="5171911">In addition to the reason for this not being error was that counsel did not inform the Court in detail of what the testimony would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.771" offset="5202422">Of course there was no doubt in the mind of the solicitor when he objected as to what its nature would be and there was no doubt in the mind of the trial judge or the Supreme Court of the State and there was no objection on this ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.563" offset="5265638">And in fact, the Supreme Court of Alabama went on to adjudicate the merits of the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.096" offset="5291760">But petitioner submits that if this procedure should be held to prevail that is if when petitioner takes the stand to testify as to the admissibility and I emphasize admissibility as distinguished from -- in another portion of the case as to perhaps the credibility of the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.190" offset="5388100">The petitioner takes the stand to testify as to the admissibility of a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.543" offset="5405550">He must then open himself up to as the Supreme Court said, as to his questions, as to his guilt in fact or as the concurrent justices said, "Matters pertaining to his guilt or innocence, sanity or insanity."</text>

            <text syncTime="1364.527" offset="5561448">There was an objection to the presence of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.094" offset="5575764">At that point, the judge called a recess and asked the jury to leave and there was a conference between counsel and the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.156" offset="5612022">Then the conference -- recess ended, and the jury came back in and there is no further discussion as to why or how or for what reason the jury came back in at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.317" offset="5652668">However, it's clear that counsel wanted the jury excluded because on two subsequent occasions during the trial, not at this point but during testimony of other witnesses on the voir dire or the preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.612" offset="5701778">There was motion for the jury to be excluded and the jury was not excluded, an objection was taken thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.817" offset="5730617">But it's petitioner's position in this case that as to this point, it doesn't matter whether jury was in or the jury was out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.525" offset="5753501">Because if the jury's in as it was here, it's, of course, highly prejudicial for them to get this evidence as to his guilt or innocence when he's taken the stand for the purpose of protecting himself from the introduction in evidence of -- the only evidence that could convict him and it was unconstitutionally obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.107" offset="5831764">But even if the jury were out, then the State could obtain evidence from petitioner's lips at that point which it could introduce later in its case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1456.970" offset="5931238">But the Alabama case that I have read occasionally refer to the fact that the jury was out and I'm familiar with at least one other Alabama case since the jury was out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.288" offset="5988498">It's the -- petitioner submits that if this practice were permitted to -- were -- were upheld, then especially in this case where there's no other evidence against the petitioner, he is trapped into having to take the stand to keep out of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.375" offset="6072822">The only thing that can convict him, that was unconstitutionally obtained, then by this, the State can obtain the only evidence which -- by which they can later convict him and even if the confession is admitted into evidence and later, the Court would hold that it were erroneously admitted into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.969" offset="6155264">Under the ruling of Stein versus New York, the State could then come here and say that sure there was an illegal confession admitted into evidence but we have other evidence whereby we can convict him, and consequently, the decision below should not be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.088" offset="6231751">A number of state courts have considered this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.716" offset="6246275">It hasn't been canvassed through any tremendous extent, but it has been considered by a number of state courts and the Supreme Court of Louisiana has expressed itself most clearly on it and the -- the reason for the rule on -- quoted on page 17 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.639" offset="6321925">Louisiana has held that it would be a simple matter for an unconscionable person to extort from the accused while alone, a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.382" offset="6360900">And thereafter falsely testify that it was given freely and voluntarily, whereupon the accused would be compelled to take the stand to contradict the witness thereby subjecting himself to cross-examination on the whole case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.821" offset="6410637">Or he would have to let the extorted confession go unchallenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.643" offset="6425893">Either of these alternatives would do violence, at least the spirit of the Louisiana Constitution.And petitioner submits that that is the consideration that should govern here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.757" offset="6470405">Now there are some cases -- this case Wheat against United States, I believe in the Ninth Circuit cited by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.471" offset="6505305">But that case really points up petitioner's contention in this case because in the Wheat case, the petitioner sought to take the stand on -- after the confession was admitted into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.168" offset="6552012">And on the issue of -- to the weight that should be given to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.098" offset="6563715">And of course when he takes the stand as to a matter of weight and credibility, it could be argued that -- then he's testifying as to the merits of the case, not in the preliminary hearing addressed only to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.222" offset="6608227">And then he should be subject to general rules of cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.171" offset="6624005">And then of course, in Stein versus New York where the Court held that the question was not reached because it was not sufficiently definite as it is here that he would be subjected to such general cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.418" offset="6677086">In the Stein case, the respondent's quotation from the Stein case in its brief is, again, makes the very point that we insist upon here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1686.902" offset="6850957">There is an additional point in this case and that of the jury exclusion and I shall address myself with -- only for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.746" offset="6894320">In this case until the time of petitioner's indictment, there had never been any grow -- any grand jury in Dallas County, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.103" offset="6931832">When petitioner was first indicted, there was a motion to quash made on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.702" offset="6954193">And the motion to quash was granted although it is not clear whether it was granted on that ground or not whereupon the jury commissioners went about selecting a new jury list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.968" offset="7019290">They -- in using this list and in selecting this list, they selected from among persons whom they knew or from persons -- they asked persons whom they knew to give them names.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.064" offset="7075610">And they also consulted a number of what might be called "impersonal" sources such as the telephone book and the city directory, and I don't recall whether it was the voting list or the tax list but it might have been something of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.857" offset="7130781">But they used this only in a sense to refresh their recollection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.445" offset="7145200">They went down and they -- they saw someone whom they knew on the list then they might have put him into the jury box.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.240" offset="7172368">They also made a practice which is not required by Alabama Law of excluding exempt persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.599" offset="7197759">That is a -- like for example, a lawyer or a doctor or a teacher or a railroad engineer might be called for jury service and under the statute, would be given an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.054" offset="7235584">He could get out of it if he wanted to, but he was not excluded from jury service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.576" offset="7253661">They also made a practice of excluding exempt persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.754" offset="7270379">At least so they stated because the record did show that whereas there was no evidence of any exempt Negroes in the box.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.331" offset="7308727">There was evidence of a small but substantial number of exempt White persons and -- well, at any rate, they ended up with about the names of about 300 Negroes in the box.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.154" offset="7360031">Now, that may sound like a very large number but in view of the fact that it was 300 out of in excess of 1700, and a view of the fact that there are more Negroes than Whites in this particular county.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.429" offset="7413112">The number of Negroes in the box really was not in excess of those found in the Cassell case, for example, where 1 out of 12 was held to be token representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.258" offset="7468387">This case, that comes out to be somewhat more than I believe 1 out of 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.606" offset="7489808">They attempt to justify the small number of Negroes on the box -- in the box in their brief by stating that -- page 13 in their brief, that it was also shown that approximately 90% of the criminal cases in the courts of Dallas Country involved Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.534" offset="7557517">Of course that's meaningless because that 20 Negroes in Dallas County can constitute 90% of all the crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.340" offset="7580714">That does not mean that any substantial number of Negroes in Dallas County are criminals and that a great many of them live in adultery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.641" offset="7609971">There's no evidence of a systematic application of this standard to the selection of jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.813" offset="7634631">But at any rate, the evidence to which it refers indicates that a very large number of Negroes in Dallas County were married by common law marriage, which as I understand it, a perfectly legal and valid form of marriage in the State of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.392" offset="7700982">Petitioner submits that this built-in factor into the jury selection system that of selecting people whom you know and the fact of putting Negroes or knowing they're Negroes for the purpose of getting some Negroes into the jury box when, as in this case, it turns out to be under all the circumstance and really a token, violates the standards of this Court it set down in a number of cases and more exhaustively canvassed in the case of Cassell versus Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="3992.921" offset="16075107">He was held for five days before being charged and he was given no preliminary hearing for 18 days.</text>

            <text syncTime="4022.494" offset="16193390">Now, we have questioning here of only at the most three and half hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="4027.608" offset="16213765">And I think this Court, as many other courts have recognized that interrogation is one way to get information and the interrogation itself is not prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="4037.819" offset="16254621">And we feel that three and a half hours at a time with ample time in between for rest include sleep is not prolonged questioning.</text>

            <text syncTime="4104.270" offset="16520443">He had his mother testify that he was thickheaded or -- perhaps it was his father.</text>
            <text syncTime="4108.554" offset="16537579">You have the fact that he was somewhere around 16 when he left the third grade.You have a testimony by three psychiatrists that he is a schizophrenic or some sort of -- of character.</text>
            <text syncTime="4124.544" offset="16601527">However, those three psychiatrists examined him for two hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.314" offset="16624619">They had no background from which to draw the conclusions other than what they asked the petitioner himself and what he told them and as one of them said a brief conversation with the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="4142.232" offset="16672266">You get the background.</text>
            <text syncTime="4143.906" offset="16678954">Now, it may be that a person could be so insane that a psychiatrist can look at him and talk to him for two hours and definitely make up his mind, but this man was holding a job in the service station and worked there for a number of years, worked there all day, servicing cars, greasing and cleaning oil and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.303" offset="16776547">And further as evidence we think of -- or perhaps the cursory nature of their investigation of the defendant or petitioner, it was brought out that he had stolen some automobile tires a year or so or several years ago shortly after the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.090" offset="16863692">The psychiatrist rather than even apparently considering the fact that that might be some indication of criminal bent on the part of the petitioner, just assumed that that was the time he broke this behavior pattern and that he was crazy from that time on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4208.165" offset="16935999">And so, we think that the -- although the state put on no countering testimony as to whether or not he was sane or insane, that the evidence doesn't show that he was completely insane as is alleged and assumed here.</text>

            <text syncTime="5208.957" offset="20939212">Turning first to Adamson against California, now there, you had the California statute involved which permitted a comment on the failure to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="5220.195" offset="20984142">And the Court brought up this -- this particular statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5226.396" offset="21008906">We're talking about the -- the choice that any defendant has to make between testifying and remaining silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5236.354" offset="21048822">And they say that it's a dilemma which any defendant might be faced with.</text>
            <text syncTime="5240.547" offset="21065540">If facts adversed to the defendant are proven by the prosecution, there may be -- don't know a way to explain them favorably to the accused except by a witness who may be vulnerable to impeachment on cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5252.735" offset="21114337">The defendant must then decide whether or not to use such as a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5256.348" offset="21128756">The fact that the witness may also be the defendant makes the choice more difficult, but a denial of due process does not emerge from the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="5268.319" offset="21176613">Now there, we are talking about perhaps merits, probably merits, but turning to Witt against United States, a Circuit Court of Appeals case, there, the trial judge heard evidence concerning admissibility in the absence of the -- of the jury and they came back in and they had the same testimony over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="5291.424" offset="21269086">And a -- at the -- after the second attempt of his testimony, the -- the judge at first of course had ruled his confession was voluntary then they came back in and the witness for the government testified again.</text>
            <text syncTime="5304.918" offset="21323003">On appeal, the defendant claimed that he wasn't permitted to testify to the voluntary aspect of his conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5311.666" offset="21350066">That was his basis of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5312.917" offset="21355081">He said, “I wasn't allowed to testify.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5316.217" offset="21368247">And the Court after reading the record said this, “We don't read it that way.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5320.911" offset="21387055">He was permitted to testify all right if he wanted to, but the Court went no further than to suggest that if appellant testified, he would have subject himself to cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5332.164" offset="21431986">And the Court goes further to say that the appellant was obviously afraid to take the stand and speak concerning anything material matter inquired of him by his counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5341.321" offset="21468662">He could not well ask that the Court guarantee him in advance that he would be asked no embarrassing questions on cross-examination if he did do -- did so.</text>

            <text syncTime="5369.324" offset="21580675">Well there, the federal agent testified to certain admissions of the defendant on a trial and the defendant didn't testify at all, and the trial resulted in a hung jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="5384.463" offset="21641174">So they go into trial again and the agent gave the same testimony and the defendant in that trial took the stand and denied the statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="5395.178" offset="21684120">And so they began to cross-examine him and Court itself just asking why he -- why he didn't testify on the trial before.</text>
            <text syncTime="5412.553" offset="21753605">And then the Court and -- came to this Court and you -- this -- this Court stated the question as follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="5419.398" offset="21780982">Was it error to require the defendant wrap it, offering himself as a witness upon the second trial to dispose that he had not testified as a witness in his own behalf upon the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5432.156" offset="21831973">And you, Your Honors came to this conclusion that a waiver of his right not to testify is not partial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5442.478" offset="21873246">Having once cast aside the cloak of immunity, he may not resume it at will whenever cross-examination may be inconvenient or embarrassed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5455.222" offset="21924237">We may not -- we need not close our eyes to the fact that every person accused of crime is under some pressure to testify less the jury despite his carefully framed instructions drawn on favorable inference and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5467.370" offset="21972825">When he does take the stand, he is under the same pressure to testify fully rather than avail himself on a partial immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5477.394" offset="22012949">And goes on to state that the protection is not to be now and then drop and then pick up again throughout the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="6063.017" offset="24355401">But we have the proposition where in response to a motion to quash, an indictment was quashed and the entire jury box thrown out and the jury commissioners instructed to refill the box, which they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="6077.974" offset="24415274">The testimony shows that prior to this time, it might have been 30 names and it goes in the box in about 1200 or so White people.</text>
            <text syncTime="6085.426" offset="24445053">Now we have testimony concerning that it contains about 250 to 300 names of Negroes and about 1500 -- excuse me -- White people.</text>
            <text syncTime="6098.453" offset="24497194">Now, I'd like to call the Court's attention to the fact that in drawing the grand jury for this particular case, it's the first time that we have drawn a grand jury or petit jury in Dallas County, Alabama, where they had 250 or 300 names in the box.</text>
            <text syncTime="6124.457" offset="24601161">So you don't have a pattern to go by with this box and this jury and this indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6134.180" offset="24640136">The other testimony we feel should -- to be disregarded other than to shed light on what used to be the practice down there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6144.429" offset="24681096">I bring that out because in Akins against Texas, one of the cases upon which we rely where this Court held, again that numerical and mathematical precision is not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="6158.351" offset="24736789">The Court remarked several times that after this Court and the Supreme Court of Texas had reversed a number of cases because of the exclusion -- systematic exclusion of Negroes that the commissioners were obviously trying to follow the mandate of this Court and the Supreme Court of Texas in refilling the box and trying to do what the law of the United States and that the State required.</text>
            <text syncTime="6187.565" offset="24853608">Now, we don't contend that mere trying is enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="6191.363" offset="24868864">But we do say this that this effort being made and shown to have been made by the jury commissioners of Dallas County certainly shows that now, there is no planned and systematic exclusion of Negroes on the jury -- in the jury box of Dallas County.</text>
            <text syncTime="6215.768" offset="24966457">Now, this Court has held that in examining the record that you're going to give some great weight or some respect to the findings of the lower court in respect to issues such as this unless there's no evidence to support the findings of the lower court and we submit that when our Supreme Court of Alabama states that there is no evidence of systematic exclusion apparent in the record, that there is ample evidence to back that statement up.</text>
            <text syncTime="6251.386" offset="25108877">Now, in Thomas against Texas, we find the same reflection by this Court that it may be that they don't have the full pro rata with the White race in the selection of grand and petit juries in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6265.497" offset="25165406">Still it wouldn't be evidence of discrimination if they fairly and honestly endeavored to discharge their duty and did not in fact discriminate then no right has been denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="6278.595" offset="25217755">And we feel that by looking at the testimony of all the jury commissioners and the clerk of the jury commission that were before the trial court, the Court can't help but see that there is no discrimination being practiced now.</text>
            <text syncTime="6297.408" offset="25292988">Now, something was said about whether or not the qualifications of the Negroes would explain the disproportionate -- proportion in the jury box.</text>

            <text syncTime="6794.996" offset="27283310">In fact, at the outset of this case, the typewritten record indicates there was a request for sanity, a lunacy board to be convened and test his insanity and the State denied this.</text>
