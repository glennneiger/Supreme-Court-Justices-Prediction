            <text syncTime="2705.944" offset="10928128">I should say that Honig testified that Schneiderman not only was a delegate of the American Communist Party to the Seventh World Congress of the Communist International in 1934 and 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.037" offset="10980582">But he was the -- the only delegate."</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.952" offset="10996255">Mr. Honig, what other countries have delegates there at the Red International Labor Unions?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.756" offset="11011406">I should explain that Mr. Honig testified about two meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.774" offset="11027498">One, the meeting of the Red International of Labor Unions at which Schneiderman was present and other one, later in that week, of the Communist International at which Mr. Schneiderman was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.571" offset="11066681">Mr. Honig is not testifying about the -- the meeting at the Red event -- at the Red International of Labor Unions."</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.415" offset="11102104">Let's take the meeting at the building of the Red International of Labor Unions about when do that take place."</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.048" offset="11120598">"There were a number of such meetings but I could mention one, specific one at which the policy of the Communist Party was discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.563" offset="11142646">And that one was in the second week after my arrival.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.748" offset="11151423">I would place that in the middle of June 1934."</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.733" offset="11163335">"How many people are present to that meeting?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.252" offset="11169395">"About 25."</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.093" offset="11176814">"25 people present at this meeting."</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.523" offset="11186531">"Was the defendant Schneiderman present?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.230" offset="11193323">"He was that one."</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.507" offset="11198443">"Did he participate in the discussion?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.344" offset="12161735">"Yes."</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.868" offset="12161630">"Will you relate as nearly as you can recall what was said with respect to the policy of the Communist Party of the United States?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.476" offset="12161526">"The Court."</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.122" offset="12161421">"And -- and who said it?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.887" offset="12161317">"The witness."</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.592" offset="12161212">"Well, the policy of the party of the United States of the American party was discussed first of all, in relationship to a situation in the San Francisco Waterfront.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.130" offset="12161108">In a moment, I'm going to get into -- if I have time, I want to say a few words about the San Francisco Waterfront.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.563" offset="12161003">Some of the justices, they recall that more vividly than others but I'll differ that for the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.924" offset="12160899">A man named Lozovsky, Solomon Lozovsky who was the head of the Red International of Labor Unions, introduced the subject by mentioning that he got a report from the American Communist Party directly by Mr. Kennison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.804" offset="12160794">"Mr. Honig, will you go ahead and tell us what was setup in the meeting and who said it?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.231" offset="12160690">Answer,"Well this man Lozovsky, whom I mentioned, introduced the question of the American Party's policy towards the situation on the Waterfront in San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.017" offset="12160585">He said that he received a letter from Earl Browder who was then the General Secretary of the American Communist Party, which stated that the longshoremen were either on strike or about to call a strike that the strike -- that the Party was endeavoring to spread this into a general strike of all Waterfront employees in San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.789" offset="12160481">And Lozovsky mentioned, that Browder mentioned what the American policy was to that effect?</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.642" offset="12160376">That they were trying to spread that into such a general Waterfront strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.519" offset="12160272">Then Lozovsky, after quoting this letter, this is still Honig testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.535" offset="12160167">"As I recall, he did not read the entire letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.965" offset="12160063">He just quoted from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.183" offset="12159958">He said that he thought that from the contents of the letter and the tenor of the letter that perhaps the strike could be further spread into a general strike of all workers at least in San Francisco, not merely the Waterfront workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.876" offset="12159854">And he threw the floor open to -- to discussion on the subject of the policy for the American Party to pursue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.864" offset="12159749">That is to endeavor to bring about such a general strike of all the workers in San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.284" offset="12159645">I'm not giving the exact words because I don't remember them but that was about what he says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.667" offset="12159540">That was about what Lozovsky said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.526" offset="12159436">Then he called upon Schneiderman to state his opinion on what the American policy should be or could be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.778" offset="12159331">Based upon what he had suggested himself since Schneiderman was the American representative to the common term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.681" offset="12159227">He said, he felt that all -- he said, he felt we all are to hear from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.097" offset="12159122">The witness giving two lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.078" offset="12159018">The witness,Schneiderman said that he thought that was an excellent suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.774" offset="12158913">That from what he understood and from what he heard Lozovsky read, are quote from the letter, "he thought such a general strike could be produced."</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.739" offset="12158809">Then many other people took the floor and agreed to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.380" offset="12158704">Lozovsky again took the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.288" offset="12158600">I'm not giving the chronological order in which they spoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.567" offset="12158495">He reminded the people there with the basic Communist Party policy throughout the world that general strike should be regarded as rehearsals for seizure of power by the Party and the working class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.311" offset="12158391">And the delegates became very enthusiastic again about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.073" offset="12158286">I should explain that phrase, "enthusiastic was in a moment stricken," a request of defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.608" offset="12158182">And they got up and endorsed what Lozovsky said and among them was Mr. Schneiderman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.163" offset="12158077">He also said that that was true that he believes such a general strike was possible and that such a general strike would offer an excellent rehearsal for the seizure of power in the United States by the American Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.282" offset="12157973">And comes a passage about the striking of the word "enthusiasm?.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.680" offset="12157868">Question, "Mr. Honig, I now direct your attention to the second meeting that was at the Red International of Labor Unions."</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.561" offset="12157764">I now direct your attention to the second meeting that you mentioned, the one that took place in the common term building, when did that meeting take place?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.198" offset="12157659">Answer, "The same week as the one I mentioned at the Red International of Labor Unions."</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.191" offset="12157555">"And was it before or after that meting?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.936" offset="12157450">"Afterward."</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.780" offset="12157346">"And who was present?"</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.070" offset="12157241">"Myself and Schneiderman, Lozovsky again, Dmitry Manuilsky who was the secretary, I believe was the title head of the Communist International.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.932" offset="12157137">A man named (Inaudible), a man named Merrin who were jointly heads of the American -- Anglo-American Secretary of the Communist Party."</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.191" offset="12157032">"About how many other people were there?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.541" offset="12156928">"Oh, I guess about 20 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.056" offset="12156824">25 people at the first one, 20 people at this one."</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.259" offset="12156719">Isn't that -- these testimonies all undenied, stayed uncontradicted in the record."</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.705" offset="12156615">"At this meeting, was there a discussion of policy of the Communist Party of the United States?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.051" offset="12164556">"Will you relate what was said and who said it?"</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.205" offset="12173228">"Lozovsky took the floor and reported substantially as the head of the Red International of Labor Unions on the San Francisco situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.773" offset="12199455">And after he's finished, Manuilsky, the head of Communist International, took the floor and he said that on the basis of the talk he have with Lozovsky, he felt there was need of immediate action on the part of the American Communist Party to bring about such a general strike, that I have mentioned in San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.013" offset="12264448">That they hope to start such a general strike up and down the Pacific coast but to start it immediately or as soon as possible anyway in San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.665" offset="12295064">And the meeting took place -- and the meeting took a vote on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.227" offset="12309274">And there were no abstentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.141" offset="12317006">There were no abstentions and there were no negative votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.420" offset="12326097">Everybody voted that such instructions to the American Party should immediately go forth from the Communist International to immediately prepare for such a general strike."</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.945" offset="12364131">"Did defendant Schneiderman participate in that discussion?"</text>

            <text syncTime="5888.342" offset="23657806">Their contention is divisible into two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5893.141" offset="23676928">At the time that the trial started there was running in a local paper in Los Angeles, a series of articles by Herbert Philbrick who was one of the Dennis witnesses on telling about his -- his experiences in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="5912.346" offset="23753832">I think it was called "I led three lives" or some -- something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5915.408" offset="23766058">This was syndicated nationally.</text>
            <text syncTime="5918.585" offset="23778701">Petitioners asked for a 60-day continuance, asked a 60-day period to commence at the end of the running of that series of articles before the -- the trial started.</text>
            <text syncTime="5935.192" offset="23845157">That motion was denied and the petitioners contend the denial of that continuance was prejudicial error.</text>
            <text syncTime="5945.079" offset="23884758">Their voider examination of the prospective jurors in this case however indicates that the judge asked all the prospective jurors on the panel, whether or not they had read or seen anything about these series of articles and all except one, said they had not seen anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5962.077" offset="23952677">And this one, a woman named Flanagan was not among the persons selected for jury to read.</text>
            <text syncTime="5971.488" offset="23990397">Now, it is true that that series of articles continued for a few days beyond that questioning into the beginning of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5979.631" offset="24022894">But the judge explicitly admonished all the jurors that they were to read nothing about the case and that they were to base their verdict solely upon the evidence they heard adduced in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="5997.774" offset="24095514">Now, the petitioners speak about building inference on inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="6002.206" offset="24113173">I say there's an inference on inference to assume that the jurors must have violated that explicit instruction of the judge in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6013.174" offset="24157059">The judge emphasized to the jurors in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="6018.135" offset="24176912">He said, "If we could try these cases upon what the jury reads in the magazine or hears over television or sees in a newsreel, or reads in the paper, it wouldn't be necessary for you to come down at all, we could just ask you to mail in your ballot as to whether or not the defendant is guilty of innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6036.591" offset="24250786">But that is incompetent evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6038.803" offset="24259563">In order to have a jury that is absolutely impartial, we have to have people who can decide the issue, not upon something they've heard or read outside the courtroom but upon the evidence adduced here in a lawful and competent manner."</text>
            <text syncTime="6052.065" offset="24312644">Well, in other words we start out with a jury, all of whom have sworn that they -- that they have not read anything about the Philbrick articles and then they're instructed along this line all the way to through the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="6279.464" offset="25222228">The Court "Would that be any surprise to the jury that the Federal Bureau of Investigation, two of whose members have sat here throughout this trial, contend that the Communist Party so advocates."</text>
            <text syncTime="6295.490" offset="25286384">The Court "Very well, I will ask you again".</text>
            <text syncTime="6298.354" offset="25297774">He's now speaking to defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="6299.991" offset="25304357">"Do you suppose it could possibly be any surprise to this jury that the Federal Bureau of Investigation contends with the Communist Party throughout the case?"</text>
            <text syncTime="6306.978" offset="25332360">Anyone who reads the article sees that the source of a Stalin statement, the Stalin statement is the report quotes, "The Russian Premier as writing in 1939, proletarian revolution is impossible without the forcible destruction of the bourgeois state machine and the substitution part of a new one."</text>
            <text syncTime="6323.213" offset="25397248">"It seems to me I've heard that right here several times in the last six months."</text>
            <text syncTime="6326.941" offset="25412190">The Court "When the matter was presented yesterday morning, I thought there was possibly something new.</text>
            <text syncTime="6331.763" offset="25431416">I haven't seen the article.</text>
            <text syncTime="6333.187" offset="25437163">But when I read the article, I didn't see anything at all in it that any person in this courtroom, who had attended this trial wouldn't recognize as having been read here, not once but several times.</text>
            <text syncTime="6343.457" offset="25478228">And a thought it occurred to me that of all the people in this community who would be least affected by that article, the jury would be and the counsel and the Court in this case who sat here for several months, hearing that sort of thing, read.</text>
            <text syncTime="6355.290" offset="25525561">To whom it would be no news, whatever."</text>
            <text syncTime="6357.809" offset="25535592">Skipping again, "Of course we would like to have nothing mentioned in the press or anywhere else that could possibly influence, even the community while a case such as this is under way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6365.485" offset="25566312">But the world can't stop while the trial goes on."</text>
            <text syncTime="6369.351" offset="25581777">The Court "Let me ask you then, do you suppose when it is known, when -- when one of the most mentioned names in this case of the FBI, when you gentlemen for the defense have brought out time and time again at this trial that two members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation sit there at counsel table throughout the trial."</text>
            <text syncTime="6386.627" offset="25650949">"Do you suppose that any member of the jury would be naïve enough to believe that J.Edgar Hoover, the head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation has contrary ideas to what was being urged by the Government?"</text>
            <text syncTime="6396.284" offset="25689506">But despite that, the judge offered to defense counsel to query the jury as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="6405.012" offset="25724406">Whether any of them had seen the article or any reference to it in the press and if so, whether any of those who had seen such reference felt in any degree, whatever, disable from basing his verdict, solely upon the evidence in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6420.979" offset="25788353">Now, I know that petitioners in their reply brief say that their objection to -- to that question was the fact that it was a compound question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6434.646" offset="25843001">That they wanted first to ask whether any of the jurors had heard it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6438.804" offset="25859615">And secondly, to have it broken down and secondly, as -- so -- so that it could be determined whether any had.</text>
            <text syncTime="6445.370" offset="25885842">And secondly, to find out from those who had read it, whether they had been unduly influence so as to render them unable to return a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="6456.502" offset="25930355">However, the Government --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="6459.238" offset="25941326">The judge wouldn't permit it to be asked in that form?</text>

          <turn speaker="philip_r_monahan" startTime="6463.867" stopTime="6718.094">
            <label>Mr. Philip R. Monahan</label>
            <text syncTime="6463.867" offset="25959821">That's not -- that is not so, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="6465.678" offset="25967135">That is the point that they make in a reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6467.735" offset="25975286">The record does not substantiate that as I shall now proceed to show.</text>
            <text syncTime="6474.948" offset="26004229">The Court "There will be only one question."</text>
            <text syncTime="6477.028" offset="26012484">I now read 13714."</text>
            <text syncTime="6479.417" offset="26022097">There will be only one question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6481.066" offset="26028680">It is whether that has happened to them and if so, has it affected them in such way, any of them that they feel they could not with open mind decide this case solely upon the evidence adduced here as they are duty bound and ought bound to do and that is all."</text>
            <text syncTime="6495.881" offset="26087926">Then we take their word, whatever it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="6500.555" offset="26106629">Now, Mr. Leonid, one of the defense attorneys says, "Your Honor there seems to be two questions."</text>
            <text syncTime="6505.033" offset="26124497">One is "Did they see these articles, newspapers or hear the radio stories?"</text>
            <text syncTime="6509.413" offset="26142051">And the second was "What Your Honor proposed, what effect did that have on them?</text>
            <text syncTime="6513.550" offset="26158561">And could they lay it aside and so forth?"</text>
            <text syncTime="6516.008" offset="26168383">The Court "I expect to put it as a compound inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="6518.698" offset="26179145">It is a matter for the jurors' conscience now."</text>
            <text syncTime="6521.473" offset="26190326">Mr. Leonid continues.</text>
            <text syncTime="6523.428" offset="26198058">"It is our view of the law, any questions with respect to what effects such articles and stories had on the jury, if there is a showing that juror saw the article or read the story are immaterial and irrelevant because we think once that showing is made then there has been an intrusion and we want the record to show, we would object.</text>
            <text syncTime="6545.426" offset="26286143">We would object to questions with respect to the effect of such articles upon the mind of the jury and because it is our view that they should be limited to whether they saw the articles or heard about it."</text>
            <text syncTime="6557.878" offset="26335880">The Court "I understand your views."</text>
            <text syncTime="6560.112" offset="26344866">Mr. Leonid "Again, Your Honor just to state our position and then Your Honor can rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="6564.571" offset="26362629">We think there are two main questions here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6566.953" offset="26372242">Did they see the articles or hear the radio report to which we are clearly have no objection that we urge Your Honor to inquire into?</text>
            <text syncTime="6573.925" offset="26400141">And second one -- secondly, the question Your Honor suggested the effect of such a reading or such a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6579.581" offset="26422711">That question we think is immaterial and irrelevant and it is that question that we would make an objection to."</text>
            <text syncTime="6586.506" offset="26450401">The Court "Just a moment, do you mean you don't want me to ask what effect it had?</text>
            <text syncTime="6590.920" offset="26468059">You don't wish me to invite them to say whether any of them feel if they have heard or read something, they can't go ahead with open mind."</text>
            <text syncTime="6597.616" offset="26494809">Mr. Leonid "We think as a matter of law, there is only one result that could flow from anybody having read or seen these articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="6608.766" offset="26539426">We think if there is a factual showing of this kind of an intrusion that the other question is immaterial and so forth."</text>
            <text syncTime="6616.117" offset="26568892">It's -- it's perfectly clear that the defense counsel were telling the Court that they didn't want the other question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6621.128" offset="26588954">Therefore, the Government insists upon the statement that it has in its brief that -- that -- that the defense insisted upon a mistrial if anyone saw this material without any inquiry as to what effect it had upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6636.026" offset="26648513">And before I sit down, I'd like to call the attention to Mr. Justice Harlan's opinion in the Flynn case where this very same document was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6645.080" offset="26684667">And as he pointed out there, the fact that -- now if -- if there is if -- there's one -- there's this one difference between the Flynn case and this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6653.865" offset="26719880">The jury were questioned as to whether or not they've seen this article.</text>
            <text syncTime="6659.254" offset="26741405">However, as Mr. Justice Harlan points out in the Flynn case, they were not questioned as to whether or not they have seen any of the newspaper publicity tackled with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6669.810" offset="26783619">But Mr. Justice Harlan points out that that is unimportant because of the fact of the explicit and clear instructions that the jury got all through the trial and in -- and in the charge that they were to consider the -- their verdict solely upon what was adduced in the courtroom and nothing that they heard outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="6694.519" offset="26882466">And so that reason, we think, that the -- the -- that the Flynn decision on this point is in all force on this point and we suggest -- submit that there is no merit whatever in the contention that a mistrial should have been declared on this matter.</text>
