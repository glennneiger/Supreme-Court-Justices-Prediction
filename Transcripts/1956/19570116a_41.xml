            <label>Mr. Mozart G. Ratner</label>
            <text syncTime="14.290" offset="160580">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.498" offset="181373">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of Ohio which sustained the issuance of an injunction, permanently prohibiting petitioners peacefully from picketing at Fairlawn's three stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.471" offset="249292">In the operation of those three stores, Fairlawn annually imports or causes to be imported from states other than the State of Ohio merchandise -- merchandise valued at approximately $300,000 each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.743" offset="318360">Under the familiar test annunciated by this Court that importation of that quantity of merchandise would be sufficient to establish that Fairlawn's operations are subject to the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.329" offset="376665">However, because Fairlawn does not import as much as a million dollars worth of goods merchandise directly or $2 million worth of merchandise annually, indirectly from out of the State, the National Labor Relations Board currently would decline for budgetary or other reasons as the Tenth Circuit recently put it best known to the NLRB to assert its jurisdiction over enterprises which fall in the category of the Fairlawn Meats Incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.079" offset="531728">The State of Ohio has no statute comparable to the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.308" offset="564642">Accordingly, it would be impossible for the National Labor Relations Board under the proviso to Section 10 (a) of the Taft-Hartley Act to see this jurisdiction which at best declines to assert to the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.510" offset="641442">We'll return to Section 10 (a) in just a moment, after canvassing briefly the extent to which Ohio's Labor policy as it was applied in this case, parallels and overlaps in the extent to which it is in conflict, which the policies that Congress would have Taft-Hartley Act determine should be applicable to disputes of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.158" offset="736005">In one respect, Ohio -- Ohio's policy is identical with the policy of the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.116" offset="767875">A strike or picket, which has as it's object compelling an employer to enter into a union shop agreement at a time when a labor organization represents only a minority of the employer's employees is regarded by Ohio is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.305" offset="860557">Under the National Labor Relations Act that is an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.952" offset="883231">However, when the National Board finds that that is the purpose of a particular strike or picketing, although it issues a cease and desist order, it is very careful to limit the scope of it's cease and desist order so as to leave the union free while it is a minority to engage in peaceful picketing for other than that purpose namely specifically, to engage in peaceful picketing for organizational purposes or to obtain recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.384" offset="1016874">And the reason it does so is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.305" offset="1028577">The legislative history of the Taft-Hartley Act makes it perfectly blank that Congress intended to permit labor organizations while they are minorities to engage in strikes and peaceful picketing for organizational purposes and to obtain recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.155" offset="1099943">Accordingly, even if we assume in this case that the National Labor Relations Board had made the same -- would have made had it handled the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.649" offset="1134007">The identical findings to the purpose of the strike and picketing that the courts below made in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.828" offset="1158666">The Ohio decree is much, much broader than a decree which the Board would have entered on this finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.386" offset="1196910">But because the Ohio courts operating in their common law sphere, function in a framework of policy so completely different from a policy framework within which the National Labor Relations Board functions, it is not at all clear that this case would have been treated in at all the same fashion, had the National Labor Relations Board considered it under the rules which Congress decided should apply to enterprises whose labor relations affect interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.515" offset="1329403">If the National Labor Relations Board had entertained this case, it would unquestionably have found and condemned as unfair labor practices, the acts of interference and coercion engaged in by Fairlawn Meats for the purpose of inducing its employees to repudiate the union, including the circulation by supervisory employees on company time and property of petitions which the employees were asked by the supervisor to sign repudiating the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.974" offset="1471300">This is a classic kind of unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.663" offset="1486033">And also, the Board would have condemned this an unfair labor practice as constructive discharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.048" offset="1511528">Fairlawn's action inducing employees who had joined the union to resign from its employment on the ground that union membership was incompatible with loyalty to an employment by Fairlawn Meats.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.177" offset="1568057">Indeed if the Board had handled this case, instead of an injunction, restraining the union from peaceful picketing and from strike, the Board would probably have issued an order compelling Fairlawn to cease and desist from its unfair labor practices and to have bargained collectively in good faith with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.612" offset="1653844">Ohio says however, that it must be free to apply its inconsistent policies to this dispute, because it -- it is not free to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.714" offset="1706193">There will be a no man's land, in which this economic conflict between these parties, the local union of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Fairlawn Meats will go entirely unregulated by any governmental authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.432" offset="1769096">That is the nub of this case and it is the thread that ties this case to the companion cases which follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.398" offset="1809011">Now the Congress which passed the Taft-Hartley Act was familiar with this no man's land problem which is created when the National Labor Relations Board for reasons of budget or other administrative considerations declines to assert its jurisdiction over an employer whose activities in the interstate commerce bring him within the scope and coverage --</text>

            <text syncTime="452.194" offset="1912142">Is there any issue in this case as to whether the Board has the power, the right to decline jurisdiction?</text>

            <label>Mr. Mozart G. Ratner</label>
            <text syncTime="458.930" offset="1939101">We raised no question, Your Honor, with respect to the Board's power to decline, to assert jurisdiction for budgetary and other legitimate administrative reasons nor do we in this case ourselves raised the question as to whether the Board's declination as it affected this case or any of the three cases here pending was in fact for a budgetary or other legitimate administrative reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.835" offset="2078699">The Labor Board however insists that all of its recent declinations in which they have tremendously expanded the area over which they decline to assert jurisdiction are predicated entirely upon budgetary and other legitimate reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.842" offset="2158738">It urges that only if they had expanded this field for illegitimate reasons which we take it in this situation to mean a desire to reallocate authority as between the states and the Federal Government would they be powerless by virtue of the proviso of the Section 10 (a) to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.557" offset="2241599">We think the Court need not decide that question here, because we think that 10 (a) is the only way that states can acquire jurisdiction over enterprises subject to the Act for which the Board declines to assert jurisdiction for any reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.552" offset="2305546">But we do think as the brief of the seven states points out, as a brief of the employer points out on the Garmin case and it seems apparent on the face of a numerous Board decisions that there is at least considerable question as to whether the Board is motivated by budgetary or other legitimate considerations as distinguished from a desire to reallocate authority between the states and the Federal Government in this field labor disputes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1591.293" offset="6468524">Now, this Court has set and it has said so in connection with cases which have canvassed the legislative history of this statute, that the purpose of the newly enacted proviso to Section 10 (a) was “to meet situations made possible by Bethlehem where no state would be free to take jurisdiction over cases of what kind over which the Board had declined jurisdiction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.592" offset="6605720">To leave out any category of cases Mr. Justice Frankfurter, any category at all from the exclusive sweep of that proviso is to frustrate the reason that Congress put the consistency limitation is, this Court pointed out in the Amalgamated Association case that the purpose of that proviso was to ensure that the National Labor Relations Policy will not be thwarted even in the predominantly local enterprises to which the proviso applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.595" offset="6729749">There is I think a touch of items in the attempt of the respondents in these cases and of the State Board say nothing of the National Labor Relations Board itself, to manufacture in ambiguity with respect to the purpose in history of this proviso at this time, because this Court has itself referred to the Section 10 (a) proviso, as the classic example of clarity, in trend, in congressional supersedure of state power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.503" offset="6849390">In California versus Zook this Court said, when stated enforcement mechanisms, so helpful to federal officials are to be excluded, Congress may say so, as in the Taft-Hartley Act Section 10 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.787" offset="6914487">The entire argument that the State should be permitted to come in within consistent laws despite the proviso rest on a balance and the fallacy is this that to keep them out is to impute the Congress would pass 10 (a) an intention to create a no man's land, but the premises is false.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.905" offset="6990973">Congress created no “no man's land.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.939" offset="6999124">It invited the states to step in and to take over in these areas which the Board declined for budgetary or other reasons to handle it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.212" offset="7028172">It invited them to pass consistent statutes so that the Board could see jurisdiction to them that's the reason Congress passed the proviso.</text>

            <text syncTime="1745.284" offset="7084492">And Congress envisioned it and took care to see that that question would be much narrower than otherwise, because the way the proviso was drafted, it requires the Board to determine before ceding that the State's statute is consistent and that it does not receive the construction inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.001" offset="7155336">Certainly there is a judicial question even remaining after that but it's a far narrower one, than the one that would be in present in thousands of cases, before this Court ab initio without a prior administrative determination, if this Court let the States in free to act, regardless of the failure of the Board to determine if there was consistency on the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.411" offset="7232972">Congress has known for 10 years that the effect of a proviso is to exclude the states from acting in this borderline field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.524" offset="7269439">The most authoritative report we have on the Taft-Hartley Act, the report of the joint committee to the second session of the 88th Congress which we reprint in full at pages 80 to 81 of our brief, says in so many words we understand that session of a proviso will not be possible unless the States undertake the passed laws consistent with the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.488" offset="7357315">We understand that, we know it and we also know it that no State has yet done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.426" offset="7377063">And then they say, the desirability of letting the states into this field is obvious, but it can only be done by an amendment to the Act which would permit inconsistent regulations in this many different policies as there are states having Labor Relations Acts, the desirability appears questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.218" offset="7460237">It has appeared questionable to every subsequent Congress which has also read the provisions of 10 (a) as I have indicated as the exclusive map by which the states can obtain authority to apply their Labor Relations' Policies in the areas to which the Act applies but over which the Board has declined to assert jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1873.301" offset="7596596">The respondent in this case, a small butcher and at one of the crossroads of Ohio never expected to reach the stage of judicial questioning when we started an action in Summit County, Ohio too and joined stranger pickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.819" offset="7686666">And I use that word because it becomes important in the discussion of the trespass angle of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.193" offset="7736195">The respondent in this case operated a three retail stores not doing any butchering but bringing in the products for sale over the counter and no sales beyond the immediate County of Summit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.651" offset="7830026">Upon the filing of this petition, a temporary injunction was requested by motion and notice and hearing and at that time, a temporary was entered with reference to two of the stores and immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.190" offset="7896168">The petitioner here removed the case to the federal court in Cleveland, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.603" offset="7929814">There on motion to remand Judge McNamee found that the petition contained no allegations of a federal question or allegations from which a federal question might be inferred is the same court that just a few weeks prior to that had refused an injunction against the Common Pleas Court of Cuyahoga County proceeding in the Richman Brothers case which eventually reached this Court on his right or authority to enjoin or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.028" offset="8087489">When he got back into the state court, the issue was made by answer and reply under the fact of some of our procedure in Ohio revived varied question of affecting commerce became an issue and there was a lack of evidence and testimony received on that very issue and the trial court found on the evidence that commerce was not effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.113" offset="8223848">The trial court brought into play at that time also the declaration of the National Labor Relations Board setting forth its yardstick and found that the figures which were presented did not fall outside of the yardstick.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.130" offset="8323845">Now this case then went to our Court of Appeals not on questions of law but it was tried anew, de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.862" offset="8366791">And there both sides offered and have the opportunity to offer further testimony if necessary or desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.909" offset="8403048">And there our Court of Appeals of three judges, unanimously found that commerce was not affected and that this union and its stranger and its business agents strangers to the play were not entitled to trespass supply, the land of the plaintiff to carry on their organizational effort to insist and compel the employer to sign a contract which contained the union security clause and require the membership in the union as a condition precedent to his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.796" offset="8622582">Now the Policy of Ohio has been as not enunciated by legislative act as we have no little Wagner Act in Ohio and no labor board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.612" offset="8677857">And in this case gentlemen, neither party appealed to the Label Relations Board either by way of representation request or by charging that any unfair labor practice had been committed by either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.912" offset="8754970">In that case, the Court of Appeals revived as you might say the order of the Common Pleas Court holding that it was against the policy of the State of Ohio to picket to compel an employer to sign an agreement embodying the union security clause where the union did not represent a majority of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.946" offset="8903137">That is the Policy of Ohio which Mr. Ratner had said to your Court, Your Honors agrees with the Labor Relations Board and the -- their decisions in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.141" offset="8967920">Now when they were dissatisfied with the order of our Court of Appeals, this went to the Supreme Court of Ohio on questions of conflict between certain Court of Appeals decisions on the similar question and that is what our Court meant in Ohio when it said there was no constitutional question presented to it in the Supreme Court because their claim was a conflict between two judicial determinations within the State and on the weight of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.036" offset="9151509">And our practice in Ohio is that our Supreme Court may or may decline to consider the weight of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.692" offset="9194141">On the rehearing motion, they urged that the decision in the Fairlawn case was contrary to the Grimes and Howard decision which had previously been upheld -- upheld the union's contention in the Supreme Court of Ohio based on the decision of this Court in the Garner case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.277" offset="9300511">And so, it is on that basis that we get into this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.623" offset="9329873">And here, we want to urge upon Your Honors, what we feel is a justification for the decisions of our state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.295" offset="9380551">We think that affecting commerce is not a mere obstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.069" offset="9407613">We think as Judge Harlan said in this railroad case last month in the United States, the tariff is not merely an obstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.307" offset="9456619">That affecting commerce as a question of fact which a state court has a perfect right to hear the evidence upon and that this Court may rely upon the fairness judicial temperament and honesty of our state courts to determine that question under the politic particular facts of the case before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.402" offset="9576991">And we have stated to Your Honors in our brief the judicial determination of this Court which we feel justifies the right of the Courts of Ohio to go into that problem and determine it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.039" offset="9643551">Now, merely for the sake of correction and not that it really matters, Mr. Ratner said our imports were $300,000 a year or as the record clearly shows that a $103,000 worth of meat was shipped in from various states on orders given to the salesman in the County of Summit where the account was carried and the transaction completed except for the transportation of the merchandise from Iowa or whatever state it came.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.547" offset="9813556">Now, I would not be able to stop here with clear conscience and fail to discuss with Your Honors the second question which is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.031" offset="9879489">We thought we were safe on the first ground I have stated to you, but this Court has permitted the entrance of this case and two others on what we feel a very tougher reason that this Court tell all of us, the relationship which of the courts of the various states has with the Labor Relations Act and the problems arising under labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.489" offset="10033298">And I concede from the later two cases from California, the Garmon and the Guss case which follows us that Your Honors have apparently had that in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.933" offset="10099127">And so when we get into that tag match so to speak, we find in the briefs filed in this case in the Fairlawn case on the one team as the AFL-CIO and the petitioner of the unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.870" offset="10186898">On the other -- at the invitation of this Court, the Solicitor General has filed a brief and the National Labor Relations Board in conjunction with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.599" offset="10249801">The Ohio Chamber of Commerce, the Ohio Retail Merchants Association, the National Retail Merchant Associations in seven states through their Attorney Generals, the States of Wisconsin, Georgia, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Wyoming and Florida and by numbers we outlay them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.836" offset="10390758">We trust our reasoning outweighs them because all of these boards and the National Labor Relations Board and the Solicitor General have stated unequivocally and without reservation that the Courts of Ohio had jurisdiction and full right to proceed here under the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.028" offset="10539447">And the same position is taken by this gentlemen from the Government and from the State Boards in the cases where the Board -- State Board is involved or where there has been an actual declination by the proper officer of the Board to accept the case which problem is not in our case because there was no declination and because we relied upon the announced declaration of the Board that they will not accept jurisdiction in a case in which are import sales and no exports were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.336" offset="10756681">We see no great distinction of weight between the problem in our case and in the Guss case and in the Garmon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.036" offset="10815509">What distinctions there are, we think are not sufficient weight for Your Honors to spend any time upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.554" offset="10853543">We are all of the same opinion that Congress has not swept the field of labor as this Court has said that there are certain delegated power which lies dormant and unexercised and the Board has the right not to exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.379" offset="11012890">Particularly where jurisdiction has been declined all of the Attorney Generals of all of the states that have State Boards have found that Section 10 (a) of the Labor Management Act does not preclude them from taking jurisdiction where the yardstick prevails as to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.442" offset="11165132">This Court has repeatedly held from Gibbons against Ogden on down to the present time that conflict is the cheap consideration or at least a very strong consideration to determine thus impasse which might arise between the courts of our state and the Boards and courts of our Federal Government but that equally traditional that labor is a field and labor problems that affect the community locally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.372" offset="11360841">And unless there is a clear inference which the courts may draw that Congress did intend clearly to preempt the field that preemption does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.028" offset="11451434">I don't know whether Your Honors may want to consider this question on the basis of preemption or on the question of primary jurisdiction, a subject this Court just discussed last week, where Judge Harlan has thought this primary jurisdiction exist where there are two places where authority originally existed but a -- an agency has come along with regulatory power and the discussion of that case I get some heartening out of as to the possible thinking of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.347" offset="11664802">When he said, that not -- not in all cases must we look to a commission for a definition of the thing it's regulating or enforcing but where it has made a pronouncement such as the Labor Board, I will use for analogy here has made in the declination of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.618" offset="11797817">We have the right to rely upon that and courts and not the commission, does have the right and the jurisdiction to proceed to hear the case relying upon that pronouncement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.402" offset="11884962">I have stated in my brief and the briefs of both the State and the Board and the Solicitor General clearly established there was no conflict between what happened in Ohio and what the Board would have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.715" offset="11970226">I prefer to take that statement coming from a Representative of the Boards than to statement of counsel guessing what the Board might have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.987" offset="12043368">Gentlemen, I felt of all cases where oral argument properly was not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.721" offset="12074297">This might be one of them in view of the fine briefs that have been written by many eminent counsel in this case and I -- as I have read my own again, I have been odd by the artistry of those for the Government, the State Boards.</text>
