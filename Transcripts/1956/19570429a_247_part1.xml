            <label>Mr. Dean Acheson</label>
            <text syncTime="25.029" offset="203525">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.452" offset="213138">This is an admiralty case.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.442" offset="225155">It -- it comes before the Court on a limited writ of certiorari for the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and the limitation of the writ restricts the argument today to a question of admiralty procedure, but the case is not the less important, I hope, because of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.411" offset="304985">I think there is eminent authority for the view that legal progress is secreted in the intestacies of legal procedure and it is there that we have to look for it in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.695" offset="354200">The question of procedure, which comes before the Court is a simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.308" offset="372590">It is whether “claimants” in a limitation of liability proceeding may undertake to subject one of their number to liability by proceeding against him under Rule 56 of the Admiralty Rules and this, of course, requires a consideration of the statutes involved and of the Admiralty Rules which are applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.466" offset="473213">Now, briefly, the case comes before the Court in this posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.430" offset="489096">The United States as the owner of the Naval Transport, Haiti Victory, which had run in to the British Transport Commission across channel ferry in European waters, ordered its ship to return to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.810" offset="550640">It did so return.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.967" offset="555238">It entered the port of Norfolk and the United States there brought limitation of liability proceedings to restrict its liability and also to ask for exoneration.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.518" offset="609468">A monition order issued in accordance with the practice and 115 claimants appeared in the Norfolk proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.948" offset="643114">Of these 115 claimants, 104 were residents of England and the continent.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.971" offset="679267">The American claimants, the 11 American claimants who entered the proceeding, the total amount of their claims was less than one-half of the value of the Haiti Victory and in sufficient sum to support by itself a limitation of liability proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.455" offset="753142">During before the file, during the course of the proceedings, the sum of the claimants undertook to implead under Rule 56, the British Transport Commission one of the claimants in the proceeding and sought to allege that the British Transport Commission was liable for the accident, and therefore, it should respond in damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.511" offset="833390">The District Court rejected this attempt and said that a limitation proceeding did not provide a forum in which claimants might adjust their liabilities to one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.248" offset="888351">The United States, in answer to the claim filed by the British Transport Commission, set up a settle alleging that this was under the divided liability law where both ships might be held at fault, so that its damages, which were comparatively small, might be off set against the one-half of the damages which it might be called on to pay, which have incurred to the Haiti Victory.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.167" offset="1004022">A trial was held, and at the trial, the Haiti Victory was exonerated from liability and the District Court found that the Duke of York, the British Transport Commission vessel was solely at fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.460" offset="1053236">All parties appealed to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.027" offset="1067447">In the Court of Appeals, the question of fault was affirmed, and this Court has refused to review that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.498" offset="1101406">However, on the procedural question, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court, saying that the precise issue on which it reversed the District Court was whether one claimant in a limitation of liability proceeding could implead, could sue another claimant in that proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.327" offset="1196701">After the decision of the Court of Appeals, the record was remanded to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.568" offset="1217599">And there, the United States filed what it calls a cross-claim against the British Transport Commission, a claim seeking to set up affirmative liability to the United States on the part of the British Transport Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.534" offset="1277471">That matter, a rule of motion to dismiss, has been entered and that is now pending in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.016" offset="1303385">It is not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.018" offset="1311431">It is not a part of this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.680" offset="1322088">Though, from the brief of the Government, there seems to be every probability that it will be argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.727" offset="1350301">The question then comes down to consider Rule 56.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.327" offset="1372662">Does Rule 56, by its terms, in the light of its history, in the light of its analysis, does that describe a limitation of liability proceeding?</text>
            <text syncTime="327.683" offset="1414144">Does it describe as those who can take advantage of Rule 56, co-claimants in the limitation of liability proceeding?</text>
            <text syncTime="337.778" offset="1454477">Or to put it in a broader way, which the United States seems to put it, are the rules of procedure in admiralty so amorphous, so vague, that a proceeding started to litigate the liability of the United States and to limit that liability if -- if it was found to exist can be turned in to a suit by other parties against another person?</text>
            <text syncTime="364.516" offset="1561475">You know admiralty practice, the rule of limitation, statute having to do with the limitation of liability as some 30 years older than the third party practice of Rule 56.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.799" offset="1618526">So, we will consider with your Court's permission, limitation of liability first.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.004" offset="1647365">This is a legislative graft upon principles of admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.343" offset="1668786">We hear about limitation of liability first in the French ordinance of 1681.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.255" offset="1692400">Half a century later, it crosses the channel and that appears in the statute of seven -- George II.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.016" offset="1719463">Then, a hundred years went by before it crossed the Atlantic Ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.924" offset="1735032">Then, the Steam of Lexington burned at sea with a cargo of gold and as a result of that disaster, Congress in 1851, enacted the limitation of liability statute, which said that the lost of a shipowner on a count of a disaster occurring among other things by collision might be limited if he will not prevail and had no knowledge of the cost of this disaster.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.311" offset="1836596">It might be limited to the value of a ship, plus the value of the freight, which was then pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.816" offset="1870660">The idea, the historic idea of this practice is to limit the risk of the shipowner to what is called the fortunes de mer, the amount which is risk on the voyage shall be the value of the ship and should be separated with the fortune de terre, which is the general assets of the shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.210" offset="1952162">This defense could be setup obviously, when one is proceeded against.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.838" offset="1974732">That's the normal way to do it, but the statute contemplated that there might be affirmative proceedings by which the injured, the shipowner who -- whose liability was at stake might take initial action to raise the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.761" offset="2034395">And the rules were laid down to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.717" offset="2042232">It was left entirely to this Court to announce the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.762" offset="2062399">And 20 years went by before this Court did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.914" offset="2079013">Finally, Mr. Justice Bradley, in the case of Norwich Transportation Company versus Wright, announced that the Court had given a thought to a rather confused practice which had grown out and that -- on that day, it was announcing the Admiralty Rules which became the procedural guides for limitation of liability proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.629" offset="2165844">Now, these rules are quite simple and they say that the proceeding is initiated by a petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.644" offset="2193951">The shipowner may file that petition in any district where the ship may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.321" offset="2220701">If the ship is not in any district, he may file it wherever he is sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.887" offset="2238882">If he isn't sued and if the ship isn't in any district, he may file it wherever he wishes in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.767" offset="2266467">The petition prays for exoneration from liability for the exit.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.989" offset="2287365">Or if that be denied for the limitation of liability to the value of the ship and her freights, the petition must setout the value of the ship and her freights, and when the petitioner is someone other than the sovereign, he must file security which forms a fund in the hands of the Court to be divided among the claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.259" offset="2388407">The rules provide that a monition shall issue and be published in courts, which are directed by the Court issuing.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.045" offset="2423515">In this case, it was published in the Courts of England, the monition of the petition, I suppose to state the parties who have been injured so far as they are known.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.080" offset="2467715">And in this case, some 17 people who were mentioned by the United States in its petition as having been killed or injured of whom 13 were residents of England and Europe.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.535" offset="2517556">And as part of the procedure, also, an injunction is issued by the Court where the petitioner has been filed enjoining all claimants from proceeding in any other court except that one.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.909" offset="2566980">Then, there is a trial on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.454" offset="2577220">And as a result of that trial, the first decision has to do with the question of fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.798" offset="2598536">If the shipowner is found not to admit its fault, then his security is returned to him and the matter is finished.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.825" offset="2626644">If however, it is claimed that it's found that he is at fault, then, the fund in the hands of the Court distributed among the claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.142" offset="2663946">Now, Your Honors can see that this is not like an ordinary judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.214" offset="2684217">It's one that starts backwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.934" offset="2691114">It's one which is started by a person who imagines himself to be a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.166" offset="2712012">He initiates the litigation by filing this petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.626" offset="2729880">And so, Judge Benedict, the leading writer on this subject, describes it as a special proceeding sui generis and indeed, it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.082" offset="2763734">His purpose was to raise the question of the liability of the shipowner, to bring into that Court all claimants against the ship, to restrict the liability to the value of the ship if he was liable at all, and -- and to distribute the assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.248" offset="2828413">And in further -- furtherance of that purpose, for over a century, this Court has given a broad and equitable construction to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.649" offset="2877942">It has described it as a useful but drastic measure, a measure which in the language of Chief Justice Taft brings in against their will all the claimants and prevents them from establishing their claims in any other court.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.363" offset="2936874">It's a very drastic proceeding, but it's a useful one and for its purposes, it has been generously construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.430" offset="2973132">But in all the years of the existence of this statute, 106 years, the last third of March, not $1 has ever been recovered by anybody in any Court of the United States against a claimant in the limitation proceeding, not $1.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.212" offset="3052231">We will have the occasion later on to examine in it into that and I believe that you'll find that that is the case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="745.521" stopTime="752.463">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="745.521" offset="3085458">Is that, Mr. Acheson, because the courts didn't accept jurisdiction in that sense?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dean_acheson" startTime="752.463" stopTime="1085.265">
            <label>Mr. Dean Acheson</label>
            <text syncTime="752.463" offset="3113253">Well, it's because in most of the cases, they held that they could not sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.458" offset="3129240">But in those where they did permit someone to be brought in, they found that the liability was otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.566" offset="3157661">So that what I am saying rather, startling way in -- in part to startle my learned friend on my right here is that in all the history of the United States, no one has ever succeeded in recovering a dollar in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.791" offset="3226520">Now, if we turn from limitation of liability to Rule 56, you'll see that this is a wholly different kind of a proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.046" offset="3259538">Rule 56 was thought by the other respondents in this suit and by the two lower courts to be the source of authority if there was any authority for any proceeding against the British Maritime Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.192" offset="3320142">It turned on the construction of that rule, the United States thinks not.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.765" offset="3334457">The United States thinks this could be done regardless of the rule, but both the lower courts and the other respondents believe the rule to be detached though.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.179" offset="3376044">Now, Rule 56 came about as a result of decision of Judge Addison Brown in 1883 in the case of the Hudson, and Judge Brown's decision has came about by reason of a decision of this Court in the Atlas in 1876.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.806" offset="3454621">Now, what this Court decided in the Atlas was that contrary to the law of England, that if a person was libeled, if the shipowner was libeled and found at fault, even though it was found only partly at fault, the libelants could recover from that shipowner the full amount of the damages, and the shipowner was then left to pursue contribution from his joint tortfeasor or feasors.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.789" offset="3566529">That became the law of United States because Your Honors said it was and it is different from the law England.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.635" offset="3589935">As a result of that, Judge Brown said, “Very well, if this is the law, therefore, if a defendant if in a libel proceeding, the shipowner who is defended, if he claims that another ship was equally at fault,” Judge Brown said, “I will issue an auxiliary writ and bring him in as a defendant into this proceeding, so that he may share the burden of the defense and pay the damages if damages there be.”</text>
            <text syncTime="899.276" offset="3700485">And that's was Rule 56 is.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.919" offset="3711039">And as it was originally enacted, it was a rule solely having to do with collision cases later on.It came to other -- other cases of injury too, but the original rule is very simple although the language bears out Mr. Justice Frankfurter's description a moment ago in some statutes which are not wholly illiterate.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.307" offset="3804557">On page 15, the statute reads as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.495" offset="3825351">“In a suit for damage by collision,” now later on, it was extended beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.181" offset="3844054">“If the claimant of any vessel proceeded against or any respondent proceeded against in personam shall, by petition, are now presented before at the time of answering the libel or within such further time as the Court may allow and containing a suitable allegation shall enfold on negligence in any other vessel contributing to the same collision and the particulars thereof, and that such other vessel or any other party ought to be proceeded against in the same suit for such damage.”</text>
            <text syncTime="965.633" offset="3965889">Now, we go back to the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.227" offset="3972263">“If the claimant show -- shall, in a play, that process be issued against such vessel or party to that end, such process may be issued.”</text>
            <text syncTime="979.593" offset="4021791">Now, what that meant is what I said a moment ago, that if a defendant, somebody who is proceeded against, believes that somebody else ought to be proceeded against as well, he may issue, of course, to have issue an auxiliary writ to bring in that other shipowner as a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.746" offset="4098382">Now, Your Honors will see that this rule is talking and applicable to libel proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.067" offset="4123669">It talks all the way through the rule of the libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.687" offset="4138088">It says, “At the time when the rule is to be invoked, is before or at the time of answering the libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.918" offset="4167032">It's invoked by a defendant who is caused on the Court upon to answer something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.338" offset="4192737">After service, there must be personal service upon the third party to be brought in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.417" offset="4213008">After service, such suit shall proceed as if such vessel or person had been originally proceeded against.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.462" offset="4245191">Now, that's a libel action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.661" offset="4249997">That's where you originally proceed against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.309" offset="4264626">And when brought in, this third party shall do what?</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.109" offset="4279777">The first thing he shall do is to answer the libel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1556.131" offset="6327881">All right, that -- that is a very good question, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.592" offset="6353690">I want to wish I was ready to address myself, because under the Government's claim, I think it looks as though the Duke of York would have no recourse to any limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.453" offset="6405204">The Government says, “Probably it would, but it doesn't know.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.618" offset="6417847">And the reason it doesn't know is that if this trial takes place in the United States, there was an amendment to the limitation of liability statute in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.486" offset="6457344">And that amendment said that “A proceeding for limitation must be started within six months of the time when a shipowner is notified of the claim.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.890" offset="6498931">Now, you can see it what's about that, what questions that raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.552" offset="6517530">The question it raised is, does this apply to a limitation as a defense or only as an aggressive act?</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.305" offset="6544593">And on that, you will not be surprised to hear that the courts are evenly divided, absolutely evenly on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.457" offset="6569148">Half of them say, “The six months limitation applies to everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.811" offset="6590568">You cannot plead limitation as a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.383" offset="6600913">You cannot certify petitioner.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.732" offset="6610317">The other half of the courts say, “It does not apply to pleading as a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.600" offset="6629752">It only applies to taking the affirmative step.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.862" offset="6642813">And the only Court of Appeals which has expressed itself on this has said that it applies to both defense and the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.033" offset="6675519">Now, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in overruling the District Court, I was following out some of the thoughts which are in the minds of Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.355" offset="6712822">And it felt two -- there were two great reasons why this should be done, why should it reverse the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.890" offset="6746885">One was because it said, “There would be grave hardships imposed upon the claimants if it did not do so,” and the other was, “because equitable principles required it to do so.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.519" offset="6793488">Now, these hardships are three in number as stated by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.936" offset="6815117">They are, that if the Court of Norfolk doesn't decide this, there will have to be another proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.158" offset="6839986">Second one is this other proceeding will be at great expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.454" offset="6857226">The third one is that it will be at a time when perhaps much of the evidence necessary to support their claims would have been lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.899" offset="6890977">Now, when we examined these, we -- we found it a rather confusing situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.566" offset="6913651">There must be another proceeding in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.000" offset="6927339">This is a British Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.149" offset="6936012">Whatever judgements it gets in Norfolk, these judgements are collected in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.608" offset="6957850">And when a claimant goes to England to collect, the first thing that the British Transport Corporation will plead is the British statute of limitation, not at that time, but limitation of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.557" offset="7017618">Now, the British limitation of liability statute is different from ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.994" offset="7035382">It's more favorable to shipowners than ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.975" offset="7047293">It's one to which this corporation is entitled in an English court and an English court will give it that benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.418" offset="7077073">So, there is one reason of why they must be --</text>

            <text syncTime="1772.835" offset="7194728">In the first place, there are 104 people involved here who are residents of the continent in England -- on England.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.301" offset="7232554">So far as hardship for them is concerned, there's certainly far or less hardship to litigating where you live than in litigating across the Atlantic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.072" offset="7263692">So far as lost of evidence due to time is concerned, they presented much more easily and much more quickly and with less chance of laws in an English court that over here in Norfolk where everybody has to cross the ocean to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.099" offset="7319803">And furthermore, there's another great loss if they would infer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.593" offset="7337775">And that is not only just the British limitation of liabilities statute applied, but under the British law, it has two contract limitations of liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="1848.412" offset="7497017">And the other reason would -- would be that a decision in the Norfolk court as to the liability of the amount of the liability of the British Transport Commission to various claimants would not be res judicata in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.726" offset="7558248">And it would not be res judicata because, the English courts would say and properly say that at the time that the British Transport Commission appeared in the United States, the law was perfectly obvious to anyone who is not perhaps a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.417" offset="7633063">That it was not subjecting itself to the determination of its own liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.055" offset="7655633">It is not doing that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.613" offset="7665873">The -- the rule was clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.134" offset="7671933">The statute was clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.969" offset="7679248">The unbroken course of decisions of our courts have -- had been in that direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.740" offset="7702340">And as I say, nobody had collected a cent in 106 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.703" offset="7722193">Therefore, the British courts would say, “Our national did not enter the American courts for the purpose of having its liability, if any, to your claimants determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.284" offset="7768482">And whatever the American court did is not res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.868" offset="7782797">And we will relitigate that court because we have our own statute of limitation of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.348" offset="7812786">We have our own contractual reasons for liability, and -- and we're all here in Europe, and I have all our evidence here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2560.493" offset="10345305">The Government's argument is that admiralty is so flexible that whatever the rules say, this Court would be permitting.</text>

            <text syncTime="2581.873" offset="10430882">It says, “Allowance of cross-claims between co-parties has been a characteristic feature of the limitation concourse since its inception.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2613.527" offset="10557524">However, one finds on reading further in the Government's brief that they don't mean what they say at all, but they do mean, is that in libel actions, where a shipowner libels another shipowner, and that shipowner in turn libels back, that in those proceedings, each shipowner is entitled to limitation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2637.703" offset="10654177">Limitation is a defense, whether it be a libel or a cross-libel or however it is, maybe, you're entitled to that defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.265" offset="10684479">But it certainly is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.366" offset="10692838">In fact, the exact composite is the case, that allowance of cross-claims between co-parties has been the characteristic feature of limitation procedures in section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.497" offset="10733380">Nothing could be informed erroneous than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.536" offset="10749471">And the case is which it gathers together, asserting that admiralty must be very broadly and broadly administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.142" offset="10783953">Our cases, which have nothing to do, were the problem before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.906" offset="10799000">For instance, in the Scotland, what was the Scotland about?</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.393" offset="10816972">That was a case, which said the foreign shipowners are entitled for limitation proceedings just as much as American shipowners, well, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.947" offset="10851140">The North Star is a case, which holds, that where two ships are equally liable, each ship is entitled to limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.320" offset="10884681">Well, surely, it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.592" offset="10893772">The Epsilon, which they cited, it's a case, which says, “Limitation is available for personal injuries as well as injuries to the ship.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.396" offset="10928985">The Adah, a great deal of talk about the Adah in the Governments brief, that is authority for the proposition which I've been insisting upon here, which is, that all parties to the limitation proceeding avowed from the question of fault, just as the Commission is bound here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.081" offset="11007666">And so, we go along, finding no cases, which support the Government's argument until we come to two, that they think there are two, the City of Boston and the Eastern Dredging case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.665" offset="11058030">Now, these are not two cases, they're one case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.891" offset="11066911">They're in 1909.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.097" offset="11075793">They were both in the same District Court in Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.762" offset="11090422">They did not grow out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.848" offset="11094810">It was very earthshaking, a maritime disaster.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.279" offset="11108498">The ferryboat, in the City of Boston, and Boston harbor run into a scow and did not hurt the scow at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.927" offset="11127097">It didn't hurt itself much, but that Mr. and Mrs. Davenport fell overboard and they were rescued, a good deal of outrage by the performance, but not much the worst way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.943" offset="11187179">Both shipowners started limitation proceedings in the same court in Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.404" offset="11209017">The Ferry Company went into the Dredging Company's limitation preceding and filed a claim, the sum of $4000 just to call us to fix up the ferryboat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.420" offset="11245066">Mr. and Mrs. Davenport went into the ferryboat's proceeding but not into the scow, and they claimed $3500 for their experience in the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.113" offset="11283832">Judge Dodge thought this over and the problem was, of course, how did both ships we're held equally at fault?</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.300" offset="11308596">How he get the Davenport damages equally divided when they were claiming in one preceding but not in the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.279" offset="11336495">So, first of all, he made a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.834" offset="11346735">The report on page 171 of 182 F., he held that it to bring the scow into the ferryboat's proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.178" offset="11388113">This is cited by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.735" offset="11398353">However, on page 179, he did change his mind on that, and thought that wasn't a very good procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.187" offset="11424162">And the best thing to do is to allow the Ferry Company, which was in the Scow Company's proceeding to put one-half of the Davenport's judgment onto its claim, which they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.456" offset="11465226">So, you see, nobody was brought in under Rule 56 and made pay anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.018" offset="11491453">The same thing turns out to be the case of -- of that long litigation between the United States and the Steel Products Company, which grew out of the accident on the Pacific Maneuvers of 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.663" offset="11545997">There, the steel inventor, a ship of the Steel Products Company, had got into the middle of the destroyer formation on night, and ran into and sank the USS Destroyer Woolsey, making a total loss of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.312" offset="11608586">There were several hearings that were all cited here, except the last part, which should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.563" offset="11633664">The first point was two cargo owners, owners of cargo on the Steel Inventor, who were prevented by the Harter Act from suing the Steel Inventor went into the limitation of liability proceedings started by the Steel Inventor, and said, “We cannot sue the Steel Inventor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.846" offset="11706807">We can't sue the United States because it's sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.253" offset="11720391">But if the Steel Inventor is held at fault, it's going to be a big fund in the Court and we want our share of it."</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.533" offset="11749543">And after some discussion, it was decided very well, “You can file your claims against this fund, not against United States, it's the sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.594" offset="11785697">But before the United States gets the money, maybe you can get hold of some of it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.800" offset="11814536">This is said to be a cross-claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.099" offset="11827806">It wasn't a cross-claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.291" offset="11832508">It was a claim on the fund in the hands of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.899" offset="11842957">But furthermore, nothing came of it, because it was decided that the Woolsey was at fault and not the Steel Inventors, so the whole litigation evaporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.061" offset="11879633">Then, there was another part of the litigation, which is much more interesting, and that was that the United States came into the Steel Inventor's proceeding with a claim, whereupon, the Steel Products Company, filed a cross-libel against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.305" offset="11952567">And Judge Hough said, “You can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.336" offset="11964688">That can't be done.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.837" offset="11974719">Because he says, “This does raise the question of an affirmative claim against the claimant in a limitation proceeding.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.899" offset="12002931">And he should -- the argument here is that every claimant who answers and opposes limitation is a libel, and therefore, is subject to a cross-libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.698" offset="12058206">But he says, “That isn't so.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.894" offset="12066983">“A libel,” said Judge Hough, “is a statement of claim on which process may issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.119" offset="12091852">No process issues on an answer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.756" offset="12106376">“A libel must state damage.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.685" offset="12114108">But he claimed, “It does not have to state any damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.881" offset="12122885">All that it states is that a claim is put in.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.219" offset="12136260">Three a libel is the beginning of an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.118" offset="12147858">The answer is not the beginning of an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.771" offset="12158412">Now, he says, “Surely, this is technical.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.461" offset="12169174">And then, this sentence, which I -- I venture to quote to the Court, “These technicalities are not unimportant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.659" offset="12201984">For while there could be a theory of law without any applied technique, there can be no application thereof without some technique, which lies at the very foundation of legal application.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.517" offset="12257468">And so, he said, “There cannot be a cross-libel in a limitation proceeding.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.919" offset="12283068">Now, counsel criticized this opinion, and I think --</text>
