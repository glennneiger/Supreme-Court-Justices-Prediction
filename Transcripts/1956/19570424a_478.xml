            <text syncTime="37.918" offset="255039">Mr. Schlesinger.</text>

            <label>Mr. M. R. Schlesinger</label>
            <text syncTime="41.105" offset="267786">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.167" offset="304044">In the case at bar, the City of Opelika, Alabama has imposed a flatsum license tax upon local merchants -- upon non-local merchants entering its jurisdiction from the outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.171" offset="376038">A tax necessarily discriminatory in its operation and indeed a tax which is discriminatory and in regard merely to the face of the ordinance itself in view of a contrasting rate structure applied to local merchants.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.913" offset="455032">This controversy reaches this Court upon appeal from a fine judgment by an Alabama Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.386" offset="500903">That Court of Appeals in turn affirmed an Alabama trial court's action in sustaining the defendant city's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint for refund of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.697" offset="570180">The Alabama Supreme Court having denied certiorari, the appeal has been taken from the judgment of the appellate court.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.026" offset="615528">Since this appeal calls into action -- calls into question the state courts' action upon the defendant's demurrer, the fact as set out in the plaintiff's compliant are of critical importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.569" offset="685641">May I therefore review those facts in a rather brief fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.284" offset="712495">Section 82 of the Opelika City license schedule for the year 1953 imposed an annual license or privilege tax upon wholesale merchants.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.966" offset="771218">That tax was according to certain graduated amounts depending upon the bracket of gross business, annual gross business into which the merchant happened to fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.992" offset="827329">By way of example, Your Honors will observe that the lowest bracket requiring a tax of $35 was where the merchant did less than 100,000 of business a year, the top amount of $250 was reached when the merchant's business exceeded to a million dollars per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.714" offset="906219">And in addition, Section 82 imposed a tax at a very small fraction of 1% upon the gross business done by the merchant.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.749" offset="954389">Now, that, if the Court please, is Section 82 but Section 82 applies only to wholesalers delivering wares in the City of Opelika from a point within Opelika.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.048" offset="1031607">For merchants delivering goods from outside Opelika into the City of Opelika, two special sections are applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.944" offset="1075179">The first of those special sections is Section 130.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.527" offset="1093465">It imposes on merchants -- on persons and firms et cetera bringing goods in from outside and delivering them in Opelika, an annual tax of $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.886" offset="1146964">That, however, is inapplicable to wholesale grocers who bring goods in from outside the City.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.890" offset="1178937">And that brings me to the second special section if I may say a special, special section, Section 130 (a), which is the Section with which this Court is primarily concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.839" offset="1214777">Section 130 (a) imposes an annual flatsum license tax of $250 upon wholesale grocers who deliver in the City of Opelika wares which they have brought in -- grocers -- groceries which they have brought in from outside of the City.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.947" offset="1335150">May I therefore review in very bird's eye fashion the three taxing patterns that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.030" offset="1363466">We have here Section 130 (a), imposing an annual license tax of $250 on wholesale grocers who bring in to Opelika from outside the City groceries.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.510" offset="1421458">Secondly, we have a $100 annual license tax, not of primary concern here which applies to others bringing in merchandise from outside the City and delivering in the City.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.725" offset="1474226">Finally, we have under Section 82 a favorable rate structure, a structure geared to gross receipts but applicable only to merchants delivering goods in Opelika from a point within the City of Opelika.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.077" offset="1563669">Now, as to the plaintiff in this action, the plaintiff is a wholesale grocer who delivered from his business over in Georgia groceries to his retail merchant customers in the City of Opelika.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.632" offset="1629915">Those deliveries were pursuant to orders taken by its salesmen which orders were transmitted over to the plaintiff in Georgia and accepted by it in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.274" offset="1688430">The shipments, made pursuant to those orders, were in a continuous movement in the interstate commerce from Georgia into Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.712" offset="1726255">The plaintiff is a Georgia corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.318" offset="1736600">Its only place of business is in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.205" offset="1748198">It has no inventory stock of goods or office in the State of Alabama.</text>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>

            <text syncTime="424.335" offset="1800756">That is quite right, Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.106" offset="1811832">And that would prompt me to observe that the fact that this tax is, you might say, more rather than less discriminatory or more rather than less burdensome on non-local business does not make it any of the less discriminatory or burdensome against interstate business.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.287" offset="1908485">But Your Honor is quite right, the discrimination involved here was not merely against Georgia business let us say but could very well have applied to Birmingham shippers as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.747" offset="1966373">The plaintiff paid the $250 pursuant to Section 130 (a), required of it to enter this Opelika market and it then brought this suit for refund, filing a complaint for refund of tax based upon constitutional grounds and particularly upon the principle that Section 130 (a) involving a $250 flatsum license tax violates the Commerce Clause as being an undue burden upon interstate commerce and as being discriminatory against interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="548.182" offset="2296142">That's one of our two points as Your Honor's question suggest and I should like to dwell on that at a little greater length in a moment if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.767" offset="2334490">I was adverting to the plaintiff's complaint and as I've already indicated, the defendant's demurrer to that complaint was sustained so we're here on the facts as set out in that complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.664" offset="2378062">Now, it is our position that this tax constituted an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.829" offset="2410663">And before adverting to the point made by Mr. Chief Justice Warren, may I first observe that our first ground for complaint here is that the statute is unconstitutional on its face in view of the more favorable fair tax structure which was applied to local merchants.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.004" offset="2503346">And I refer in particular in that case and in this connection it becomes necessary to look at Section 82 of the city license schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.477" offset="2537305">Section 82 imposes a graduated tax approximately proportionate to gross receipts on local merchants.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.264" offset="2576384">Section 130 (a) by contrast imposes upon wholesale grocers delivering groceries from a point outside Opelika the flatsum tax of $250.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.081" offset="2631659">And I think it is of some interest to this Court surely in connection with this first proposition that in order for our plaintiff taxpayer over in Georgia, required to pay this $250 tax, to bring his rate of taxation down to the rate paid by local wholesale grocers.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.052" offset="2735626">It would be necessary for him to ship in and sell in this community of something less than 13,000 soaps in amount of groceries at wholesale prices in excess in one single year, in excess of a quarter of a million dollars.</text>

            <text syncTime="685.556" offset="2845550">What I attempted to do, Mr. Justice Black, is to take Section 82 and compute at what point a local merchant would have paid $250 under that graduated schedule and it happens to break at $280,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="1226.582" offset="5009742">Now, the defendant seeks to distinguish of all these Supreme Court cases, respecting the invalidity of a flatsum license tax as such and particularly the Nippert, the Memphis Steam Laundry and the old Robbins case on the grounds that a tax and I quote from its brief at page 4 from the defendants brief at page 4, “On the ground that the tax in those cases was levied upon the solicitation, the Court will bear in mind that the tax here is on delivery, was levied on the solicitation of sales to be later consummated by delivering in interstate commerce."</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.016" offset="5179434">Furthermore at the foot at page 4, the defendant in it's brief to leave no doubts about that distinction which the defendant is seeking to have this Court adopt says, "This Court has never said that there is any impropriety in the levy of a flatsum license on the incident of delivery."</text>

            <text syncTime="1476.421" offset="6009083">The defendant in its brief relies upon this Court's opinion in its Berwind-White case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.255" offset="6032384">Now, let's just look at that case very briefly, it dealt as already indicated with a sale tax on an interstate sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.446" offset="6061119">In the course of its opinion, the Supreme Court reaffirmed at great length its flatsum decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.447" offset="6089122">The defendant at page 4 quotes from a sentence from the remarks of that Court, and may I indicate that the quotation is from a part of a sentence from the remarks of this Court and omitted are the -- is a phrase at the beginning of the sentence in the clause of the conclusion of that sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.662" offset="6174072">Be that as it may however, a reading of that complete sentence from which the defendant has excised the part and a reading of the complete paragraph from which it has been brawn would indicate the Supreme Court's thinking, respecting the invalidity of a flatsum tax not being confined to solicitation before commerce and therefore all right on delivery itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.960" offset="6291205">If there is to be any distinction and it is the defendant who suggest a distinction between a tax on delivery and a tax on solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.572" offset="6325687">Surely, the case wherein validity is no -- is the case wherein validity is clearer when the tax is on the delivery in interstate commerce then it -- is it in the case of a tax on solicitation to be followed by interstate commerce which is not to say however that the appellant suggests that any distinction be made on that ground of Tweedledee and Tweedledum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.580" offset="6441671">Now, may I just withdraw from the trees for a moment and look at the forest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.354" offset="6464763">Look at the forest in terms of local physical demands as contrasted with the desirability and the constitutional mandate that interstate commerce should not be unduly impeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.050" offset="6519620">It might very well be that a local taxing jurisdiction should look to interstate commerce to pay a fair rate of tax when it enters the local taxing jurisdiction.But that's a far cry from what we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.548" offset="6597569">We have, first of all, a flatsum license tax invalid on its face in contrast with a tax -- a fair apportioned rate against local business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.512" offset="6657442">And we have in the second place the fact that there is probably no need to look to that local taxing rate in view of the fact that this Court has repeatedly held that a flatsum tax which must be paid as a prerequisite to coming into the jurisdiction, which must be paid regardless of the amount of business done is by virtue of being a flatsum tax invalid as applied to intestate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="1682.234" offset="6832358">The appellant in this case has raised two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.401" offset="6848972">First, he says that this is a delivery at the end of a continuous journey on interstate commerce and hence it is not subject to a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.604" offset="6909785">Second, that it is discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.345" offset="6928802">First, we would like to deal with the two propositions which you asserted in the jurisdiction -- the jurisdictional statement separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.718" offset="6978226">There have been numerous cases by this Court over a period of many, many years dealing with the question of municipal licenses and state licenses on matters involving interstate commerce in the conflict with the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.865" offset="7066833">Our time is too short to discuss all of those cases in detail but I would like to say briefly that in early history of those cases the decisions were very narrow in their scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.486" offset="7133288">The decisions almost universal -- universally held that anything which in any amount touched interstate commerce constituted an imposition on interstate commerce and was an improper burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.141" offset="7215940">Now, at the time that the Berwind-White case opinion was delivered, it was held by municipal authorities as a very liberal construction on the part of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.141" offset="7295979">It was interpreted as having -- actually announced new law as having perhaps overcome the previous narrow decisions which had been written during a period of 100 years before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.030" offset="7383542">Now, briefly the Berwind-White case and its rather amazing that both counsel rely upon the same opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.091" offset="7419695">Briefly, the Berwind-White case announces three propositions that we are primarily interested in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.231" offset="7456266">The first proposition it firmly establishes that a local tax may be levied at the point of delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.314" offset="7504645">I believe that in the Berwind-White case that it said that the taxable thing was the passing of title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.022" offset="7551457">But in the case which was decided a short time later, I believe it's known as the Fuel Corporation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.534" offset="7581550">That is Fuel Corporation versus Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.558" offset="7593566">They said it was not necessarily the passing of title which determined it but it was the passing of possession which was the taxable event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.956" offset="7635153">Now, we say that under the Berwind-White decision, the Fuel Corporation case, there is no question but that a municipality may tax the incident of change in possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.766" offset="7706415">That is the incident of local delivery that we think is very, very clearly established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.645" offset="7749987">Now, the Opelika ordinance simply says that any person who unloads or delivers wholesale groceries is subject to this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.204" offset="7804217">Now, that is certainly a tax directly levied upon the change in possession and under the Berwind-White case, it is certainly entirely justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.771" offset="7862418">The next proposition which the Berwind-White case laid down affirmatively, I believe it had been touched upon probably in the Western Livestock case prior to that time, but it -- it asserted in so many terms that there was no reason why interstate commerce should not bear its fair share of the local tax burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.565" offset="7961684">Prior to do that time, interstate commerce had been a sacred cow, insofar as bearing any share of the local tax burden was concerned, but by that decision and subsequent decisions it has been conclusively established that interstate commerce at the point of delivery should bear its fair and just and reasonable part of the local tax power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.929" offset="8099088">The third proposition which was asserted and asserted affirmatively was that the case of Nippert versus the City of Richmond and some Robbins versus Shelby County Taxing District and the other so-called drummer cases are cases which are very, very narrow in their scope.</text>

            <text syncTime="2065.452" offset="8365223">As suggested by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, perhaps by Mr. Justice Black, if the City of Opelika had levied a flatsum tax on all local wholesalers of $250 and a flatsum tax of $250, would there be any discrimination?</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.464" offset="8473266">We most respectively submit that under the Berwind-White case there is absolutely nothing which precludes a flatsum license.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.369" offset="8516838">We know as a matter of practice that it is virtually impossible for a municipality that is a small municipality of some $12,000 or $13,000 to attempt to levy and collect from a non-resident corporation doing business in that city anything other than a flatsum license tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.427" offset="8609102">Those simple reason that the records of the company are not available, there is no means by which the tax can be enforced unless you resort to perhaps the States of Georgia or the States of Tennessee, and so as a matter of practical application the municipalities have found and that is a especially small municipalities that a flatsum license tax is necessarily levied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.829" offset="8730728">So we submit there is nothing unconstitutional in a flatsum license tax levied on the incident of delivery.</text>

            <text syncTime="2529.168" offset="10220022">We'd like to call the Court's attention to this fact that first all municipal taxes in the State of Alabama and I assume in other states are levied by virtue of -- of legislative authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.390" offset="10284910">The legislature authorizes the -- the levy of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.593" offset="10305703">In this particular case the -- the Code of Alabama provides that a tax may be levied by municipalities for the purpose of raising revenue and also in the exercise of its police powers either or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.118" offset="10399848">We think that the -- the significant part of that statute of course is the portion which gives the municipality the privilege of levying a license in the exercise of its police powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.332" offset="10472678">Now, in the -- in levying a license in the exercise of police powers, it necessarily follows that the municipality must have the right to classify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.250" offset="10536417">And actually, (Inaudible) being one classification, retail grocery store might be at another classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.135" offset="10595871">Therefore without question your municipal authority has the right to classify various types of businesses in connection with the exercise of that police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.442" offset="10657102">Now, in this particular case they have classified merchants who operate places of business within the city in one category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.676" offset="10722095">They have classified merchants who bring wholesale groceries in from other points and from without in levy category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.983" offset="10763264">The question therefore with which we are presented is whether or not that is a valid classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.497" offset="10797328">Now, I'd like to just view a brief with my manner in which this case arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.030" offset="10819480">They filed a complaint which in substance alleges that they were doing the business and sets forth these various municipal ordinances which are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.111" offset="10871829">They alleged in their complaint that these -- these two ordinances constituted a discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.650" offset="10918013">Now, the -- the Supreme Court of Alabama has held repeatedly that a business may be classified under the police powers where it operates from a given place of business within the municipality and where goods are brought in from without the municipality and that such a classification is presumptively a valid classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.028" offset="11063463">It is recognized that in the exercise of your police powers, your municipal police powers are that you have -- you exercise a certain control over your local merchant, they are subject to your jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.165" offset="11144025">You are confronted with an entirely different problem when you have itinerant merchant bringing goods in from other states or elsewhere and -- and selling those goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.699" offset="11198151">Therefore, the Court has said that a classification of a local store as contrasted with the classification of a store which is beyond the city is presumptively, and I use the word presumptively advisably, is presumptively a valid classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.013" offset="11299401">Now, the corollary to that is that if it is presumptively a valid classification then the allegations which are contained in the complaint constitute a conclusion of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.852" offset="11374738">When he says that this ordinance is discriminate against me, he isn't alleging nothing more or less than a conclusion of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.152" offset="11419982">Our end was upon that theory that the trial court sustained the demurrer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.906" offset="11442970">It was upon that theory that the Supreme Court of Alabama sustained the demurrers of the lower court.</text>
