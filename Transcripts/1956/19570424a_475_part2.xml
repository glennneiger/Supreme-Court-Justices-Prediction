            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>

            <label>Mr. G. Kent Yowell</label>
            <text syncTime="7.198" offset="132159">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.840" offset="158699">This record shows, if the Court please, that we are dealing with the sale of money orders, small money orders from one cent to $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.029" offset="223483">Neither American Express Company nor these appellees ever sells a money order for more than $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.968" offset="267264">Mr. Smith, the Executive Vice-President of the American Express Company testified in this case that the average amount of money orders sold by American Express Company is in the neighborhood of $15, that's the average size.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.595" offset="341765">This is obviously not something that is peculiar to Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.415" offset="360991">All over the United States, you see ads in the paper, full-page ads.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.622" offset="381889">They don't tell you how much things are anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.323" offset="388681">They tell you how much a week it is and many people don't have bank accounts and that accounts for the great growth in -- in the credit, the transmission of credit, the little folks that have to send money orders because they don't have bank accounts.</text>

            <label>Justice Harold Burton</label>
            <text syncTime="87.967" offset="455241">Is there any real difference between these and the type of checks that they use in money?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="g_kent_yowell" startTime="92.945" stopTime="533.563">
            <label>Mr. G. Kent Yowell</label>
            <text syncTime="92.945" offset="475199">Not any real difference except this.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.854" offset="490768">These appellees' money orders are orders on a bank just like a bank check.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.410" offset="516995">They have an account in the bank, special account to cover these money orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.591" offset="537788">It comes in to the bank, the bank pays automatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.476" offset="565269">Theoretically, I suppose that they wish they could call up and stop payment on a particular order but that it have to be pretty quick about it because they get right into the bank, the local bank and are paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.554" offset="609573">Whereas the American Express money orders are not orders on a bank or on anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.081" offset="643741">They're a little more like a promise that the American Express Company will pay and as a matter of fact we asked Mr. Smith of the American Express Company, if you ever had some agents that went bad and became dishonest and he said, “Yes, they did occasionally.”</text>
            <text syncTime="150.808" offset="706644">And we asked him if in all cases their money orders were paid and he admitted that they are not, that sometimes they suspect there might have been some chicanery they won't pay their money orders and he admitted that sometimes their opinion is not in accord with the -- the man's opinion who put up the money and bought the money order and litigation ensues.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.223" offset="820224">And in that connection, the record shows that the American Express Company is not an express company at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.142" offset="855960">It is not licensed in Illinois, that's admitted in the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.464" offset="877275">It is a joint stock company under the old Dutch laws in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.847" offset="906742">It has only five in Illinois under the Illinois assumed name statute, a certificate that 25 individuals, all non-residence of Illinois are doing business in Illinois under the assumed name of American Express Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.153" offset="992005">And we asked Mr. Smith about those various individuals and we found out that five of them, including Theodore Roosevelt are dead, presumably this (Inaudible) was filed before any of them died but that is the record in this case, that it is not a certainty that when a person in Illinois buys an American Express money order, it is not absolutely certain at all events that he -- that that will be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.814" offset="1102660">The Court also had reported the fact that there are three cases in Illinois where the American Express Company was sued and they defended on a ground other than the merits of the case which they might -- might not have any significance because there are only three of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.578" offset="1169638">But as a matter of fact, the American Express Company, the Court should know, was in existence before counsel says it was 1882 because the first case in Illinois was in 1865 when they were actually in the express business in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.143" offset="1223973">Somebody made a shipment of money by way of American Express.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.878" offset="1246856">The money was lost and a suit followed and the American Express filed a -- an affidavit that the service wasn't good because it wasn't a corporation, it wasn't a legal entity and couldn't be sued, the Supreme Court of Illinois held that that wasn't a good plea because they had to give the plaintiff a better rip which has no significance, no claim it has except that it does show that in 1865 there really were an express company.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.279" offset="1360436">Now, there were some mention of generic terms expressing exception whether an exception perhaps should be in generic terms rather than singling out someone by name.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.266" offset="1452387">New York has a statute that contains an interesting exemption that is generic in its nature and it provides -- it's not the statute referred to in the appellant's brief which is the New York check-cashing statute that has no exemption in it and nothing to do with this case, but this is Section 180 in Mckinney's Consolidated Laws of New York, Book 4, part 1, Banking Law, Section 131 and Section 180, "Prohibitions against encroachments upon certain powers of private bankers, saving banks and savings and loan associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.923" offset="1655097">Except as authorized by this chapter, no individual, either for himself or as trustee and no partnership or unincorporated association shall engage in the business of transmitting money or selling money orders unless he puts up at each place from which his money orders are sold, bonds, the federal, state, municipal or preschool district bonds in the amount of $100,000 for each place at which such business is to be conducted."</text>
            <text syncTime="425.453" offset="1805145">Nothing in this paragraph shall apply to an unincorporated express company having a contract with a railroad company.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.500" offset="1861360">Mr. Smith, the Executive Vice-President of the American Express Company, testified that American Express Company has a contract -- a contract with a railroad in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.105" offset="1939832">He said he thought it was -- it was the Skaneateles Railroad Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.283" offset="1964492">The Skaneateles Railroad runs from the town of Skaneateles at the north end of Lake Skaneateles and Onondaga County to Skaneateles junction, a distance of five miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.666" offset="2034082">Because the American Express Company has that contract, a contract with a railroad, it does not have to put up $100,000 bonds in each one of the -- that 2500 places in New York, $250 million in order to sell money orders averaging $15 a piece.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.238" offset="2132302">Now, we're not attacking the New York statute but it was in generic terms and I give it for the purpose of this illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.679" offset="2166053">As a matter of fact, the Supreme Court of Missouri had this identical exemption before it and held that it violated the -- the Equal Protections Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as well as the Missouri Constitution of this very statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="594.036" offset="2479522">Now, I'm giving this New York statute as an illustration because the fact is appellee's licensors in this case has an express company called the Travelers Express Company and it has a contract with a railroad in New York State which runs all the way out of the State, a distance of 11 miles and today there is free competition in New York between the American Express Company money orders on the one hand, Bondified express company money orders on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.229" offset="2648273">There is today free competition between the Bondified Systems and Mr. Smith of the American Express Company mentioned this in his testimony in Missouri and in New York and in Ohio and in Massachusetts and in California and in Texas and in New Jersey but not in Illinois.</text>

            <text syncTime="687.884" offset="2854954">Now, it's one that I think is bad but this is a matter of illustration, Florida passed an Act that nobody can sell a money order in the State of Florida unless he has assets or it has assets that exceed his liabilities by $1 million and unless for a period of five years before they passed the law it sold Travelers checks and money orders in Florida.</text>
