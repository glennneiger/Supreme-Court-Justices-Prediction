            <text syncTime="20.386" offset="184926">This is a case that arises under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.913" offset="227035">It involves a workman that was injured in the course of his employment while working for the Santa Fe Railway Company at Brownwood, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.200" offset="304149">The injury was sustained on July the 12th, 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.624" offset="341870">On that day, a locomotive was in the shops of the company for repair.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.784" offset="378546">The clerk of the general foreman told Deen, who was the coppersmith for the railway company, that we must have this locomotive out of the shops today.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.951" offset="451166">Now, to repair the locomotive, it was necessary to use babbitt which is an alloy of antimony, copper, and tin.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.562" offset="513651">The babbitt that was available was in a steel pot that leaked so badly that it put out the fire which burned underneath the pot in the furnace.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.243" offset="592332">Now, on that very day, the railway company was planning to replace the pot with a new one.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.820" offset="626604">And the foreman told Deen that if he had that old pot off of the furnace and have the furnace ready to be replaced with a new pot, that he could use the men that brought the new pot to lift it upon the furnace and also to place the babbitt in the new pot for melting.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Lee Guthrie</label>
            <text syncTime="166.756" offset="770382">Now, Your Honors, the steel pot weighed about 250 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.826" offset="802670">And the babbitt that was in the pot weighed some 550 or 600 pounds as I remembered.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.980" offset="843316">The steel pot and the babbitt together weighed almost a half a ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.005" offset="879365">Now, right beside the steel pot was a hoist that it then furnished by the railway company for the purpose of lifting heavy object.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.707" offset="938193">Now, this steel pot fitted so snugly in the furnace that it was necessary for Deen to take a crow bar and pries it off to the furnace, a distance about half an -- inch-and-a-half, so that it could be gripped by the arms of the hoist and lift it from the furnace onto the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.874" offset="1058879">He revolved the hoist around, fitted the arms of it under the -- under the rim of the steel pot which was a inch-and-a-half to two inches wide, then he tried to take the pot from the furnace to the floor and in the course of the transfer, the steel pot fell to the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.672" offset="1174026">And Your Honors, he then tried to overturn the steel pot with the babbitt in it by himself, but he was unable to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.193" offset="1224182">A fellow workman and a blacksmith in the shop saw the difficulty that he was in and they voluntarily came to his assistant, then both tried to overturn the steel pot to empty out the babbitt but they were unable to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.389" offset="1300877">And then both of them went around to the front of the pot, one braced himself against the furnace, that was Deen, Snow braced himself against the steel bent that was there and they pulled the steel pot towards it.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.628" offset="1369840">Just as it reached an upright position, the babbitt slab out of the pot, caught Deen's right leg, mangled him and crippled him for life.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.106" offset="1427832">And the case was tried before a jury in the state court at Brownwood, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.275" offset="1464508">The case was submitted to the jury in accordance with Texas process on special issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.924" offset="1499094">Now, the jury in response to those special issues made the following findings, that the railway company did not furnish Deen proper tools to do his job, that this failure was negligent and that it was approximate cause of Deen's injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.026" offset="1599509">The jury also found that the railway company did not fail to give Deen proper supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.391" offset="1644962">They found that the railway company did not fail to furnish him sufficient help to do the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.504" offset="1677354">That Deen's failure to use the available help was negligence and this was the proximate cause of his injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.588" offset="1725733">But the jury also found that Deen was not negligent in the manner and method that he used to do his work, that the sole cosmic cause of his injuries was not Deen's negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.650" offset="1793964">And that the railway could anticipate, could recently anticipate that Deen would do the job in the way and manner in which he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.542" offset="1841507">And that $39,000 would compensate him for his injuries, but because of his own negligence that that recovery should be reduced 45% or $17,550 leaving him a recovery of $21,450.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.254" offset="1956342">Now, Your Honor, the trial court reconciled all of the findings of the jury and rendered judgement in favor of Deen for $21,450.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.605" offset="2025827">And that was the only judgement that could be rendered, giving effect to all of the findings of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.344" offset="2068773">Now, the railway company appealed the case to the Court of Civil Appeals of Texas, and they set aside the judgement of the trial court and said that Deen should recover nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.034" offset="2131466">They didn't even send the case back for a second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.780" offset="2154454">And Your Honors, in order for the Court of Civil Appeals to do that they could only give effect to certain findings of the jury and ignore other findings of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.548" offset="2221537">We say that the Court of Civil Appeals deliberately circumvented the findings of the jury in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.443" offset="2265109">We say that the Court of Civil Appeals of Texas resorted to certain very obvious devices in order to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.401" offset="2308995">In the first place, they construed our pleadings strictly against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.550" offset="2341595">And, Your Honors, pleadings in Texas are very liberally construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.150" offset="2372002">And this is particularly true after verdict of the jury has been rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.235" offset="2400319">But in this case, the Court of Civil Appeals strictly construed our pleadings against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.152" offset="2435950">And we say -- we said in our pleadings that the injuries which Deen sustained, approximately resulting from the railroad -- approximately resulted jointly and severally from the failure of the railroad to furnish proper tools and from the failure of the railway to furnish sufficient help to do this job.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.325" offset="2568652">That is true that in another part of our pleadings we said that the railway company either failed to furnish proper tools or to furnish sufficient help.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.453" offset="2633226">Now, instead of construing our pleadings levelly, the Court of Civil Appeals ceased upon that allegation where we said that it either ought to be the one or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.299" offset="2680560">They said that put the burden upon us to prove two acts of negligence in order to succeed in the case, and that the railway company only had to disprove either proper help, either sufficient help, or proper tools in order to succeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.276" offset="2756524">Now, the second thing that the Court of Civil Appeals did, if -- if Your Honors please, is that they said that all findings that the jury made in favor of the railway company was amply supported by the evidence, whereas no findings that the jury made in favor of the injured worker was supported by the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="733.867" offset="3038856">And I -- I'm charging the Court of Civil Appeals that deliberately circumventing the findings of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.490" offset="3077308">Now, Your Honors, the Court of Civil Appeals of Texas did a third thing to get around this jury verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.286" offset="3116492">They made a finding for the jury that the jury did not make for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.817" offset="3142614">They say that the finding of the jury that the railway furnished sufficient help to do this work, and that Deen was negligence for not using additional help and they said this was the approximate cause of his injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.059" offset="3223594">They construed that to mean that the railroad company had furnished a safe method to Deen to do this job, and therefore, since they had furnished him one safe method that they didn't have to furnish him another.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.704" offset="3286183">But the jury didn't say that, Your Honor, and we didn't plead our case that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.566" offset="3305618">We said that both proper tools and sufficient help were necessary to do the job safely.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.504" offset="3341354">And if there's going to be any implied findings made which can -- which it can be made in support of the jury verdict, those implied findings have to be consistent with the findings that the jury made and consistent with the theory upon which the case was tried in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.258" offset="3420453">Those implied findings are made by the trial judge and not by the Court of Civil Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.768" offset="3458487">Now, Your Honor, the Court of Civil Appeals in construing that this was a safe -- that the jury finding of sufficient help was a safe method of doing this job meant that the Court of Civil Appeals found that the railway company furnished a safe method to do the job when the railroad company itself plead that they didn't furnish Deen any method to do the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.693" offset="3594115">They said that he himself selected his own method and if there's any negligence in the way he did it then that it was Deen's own negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.357" offset="3628805">And that they didn't give him any instructions at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.699" offset="3642180">But even though the railway company plead that they didn't furnish him any method for doing the work, the Court of Civil Appeals found that they furnished him a safe method for doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.418" offset="3689096">Now furthermore, Your Honors, the position of the railway company in the trial court was that this accident would have happened no matter how many men that you had there at the time of the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.405" offset="3744998">That when you raise the steel pot in upright position that the babbitt was going to slip out as a whole -- a whole shop had been there, and Deen said it might have fallen on two ovens instead of one if more workers have been there.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.816" offset="3810617">But even though the railway company took that position in the trial court, the Court of Civil Appeals says that the evidence was sufficient to show that they had furnished him a safe method to do the work because they furnished him enough help to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.487" offset="3885328">So if the Court of Civil Appeals' decision, Your Honor, resulted in the Court of Civil Appeals construing the evidence more favorably to Deen than the railroad itself construe the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.881" offset="3954918">Now, is it a travesty on justice that Deen is told by the Court of Civil Appeals to limp through life without any compensation because of a fact that the Railway Company said had nothing to do with the accident?</text>

            <text syncTime="1053.026" offset="4315512">We start of with the fundamentals of Master and Servant law, that is that the employer's duty is to furnish a reasonably safe way to do the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.646" offset="4365981">There are others but that's the one that's here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.164" offset="4379982">Now, in this case the charge and in spite of Mr. Guthrie's statement, there is no question but the pleadings in this case were in line with what I'm about to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.440" offset="4433168">The charge that we should have furnished a reasonably safe way to do the work were that we should have furnished adequate help to do the work with safety or adequate tools to do the work with safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.648" offset="4481964">Their pleadings recognize that it was no duty to furnish two ways to do the work in safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.263" offset="4504430">There is no duty on the master to furnish several safe ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.242" offset="4520312">In this case, the jury -- the jury found that we furnished adequate help.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.245" offset="4544345">Now, there was no tools furnished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.305" offset="4552600">There was no -- there was -- wasn't a way that the railroad furnished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.802" offset="4566601">This work had been done before, Deen had done it before and he had always done it manually with adequate help.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.560" offset="4597635">On this occasion he chose not to get the help.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.127" offset="4611845">The help was available and the jury found it was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.630" offset="4621876">He could have done it safely with the means provided by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.329" offset="4640684">The employer furnished a reasonably safe means to do the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.569" offset="4657612">Now, I'm going to have to come back to that, but I want to state my three points if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.261" offset="4680391">The second point that the Court of Civil Appeals held against the petitioner was that having by his pleadings alleged that we had the duty of furnishing either adequate help to do the work in safety or sufficient tools, he had the burden of proving that we didn't either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.733" offset="4758340">Now, that's in accordance with our Texas rules of pleading that are applicable to all civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.029" offset="4779447">And since they found that we furnished adequate help, he hadn't sustained the burden of his pleadings and consequently the jury verdict was in favor of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.150" offset="4832005">The third reason was that under the record in the case, there was no evidence of negligence in failing to furnish sufficient tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.544" offset="4869517">Now, if I may come back and take those in that order, this was not a steel pot as Mr. Guthrie said, it was a cast iron pot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.824" offset="4910686">And for some reason or rather when the petitioner printed the record, the pictures which were there to -- would show the situation were not printed, and with Mr. Guthrie's permission I put two of them in the back of my brief, and I think with one picture is worth at least 5000 of the lawyer's word and you can see the situation by looking at the pictures in the pocket part of the pale green brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.661" offset="5026043">There are two pictures there and I'll wait a second to let the Court -- there are two pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.104" offset="5055822">One of them is a picture of a man holding up this cast iron pot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.259" offset="5080377">The man is Snow who was the witness in the case and the man that was helping Deen when he was hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.839" offset="5106709">He is holding it up and the slab of babbitt is in front of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.403" offset="5124995">Now, that's the old pot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.270" offset="5132413">Now, just to the right is the -- what you call a babbitt furnace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.704" offset="5158222">The hole in the bottom of the pot is not a drain, this thing looks a whole lot like a kitchen sink, old fashion kitchen sink without a drain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.088" offset="5191764">That's what a babbitt pot is, a little deeper and a little longer but it looked like a kitchen sink.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.027" offset="5211512">That's not a drain, that's a crack that had been in the pot for some time and that was the reason that it had to be replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.481" offset="5241292">Now, a babbitt pot lasts indefinitely, I think the record in this case will support the statement that it lasts five or ten years, and this wasn't something that had to be done everyday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.044" offset="5283506">Now, looking at the other picture which is Exhibit 5 and most of these pictures were identified by the plaintiff himself, you will see the picture of the so-called babbitt furnace with a new pot in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.028" offset="5335437">That is the way it looked before Deen took it on and put it on the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.571" offset="5353618">Just to the right of the furnace itself is the babbitt pot on the floor and the slab of -- of babbitt in front of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.987" offset="5391339">Now, this is as obvious there, this is just a -- a gas -- a fired pot in which they keep babbitt and they heat it up and melt it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.762" offset="5430418">I think Deen testified that it was kept hot all the time when the shop was going.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.852" offset="5450794">In that second picture there is a post, it looked silver there and to that was attached this hoist that was used primarily to raise and lower a different piece or pieces of equipment into the babbitt pot, it wasn't put there to raise the babbitt pot out, it was to raise and lower things in it where there'd be babbitt in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.573" offset="5541700">This -- what Deen was doing, he'd gotten that babbitt pot out and he got it on the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.547" offset="5569599">And it happened that that crack in there had been discovered some three or four weeks before and he had taken the pot out, dumped the babbitt, brazed the crack, put it back in, put the babbitt back in and at that time ordered a pot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.867" offset="5634800">It was two or three weeks to get in there and during that time he had to take the pot out and brazed the crack -- at least three times by recollection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.626" offset="5669909">On those occasions he did it just like he did this time with one exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.127" offset="5687881">On those occasions, he got five or six men to help him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.675" offset="5702092">This occasion he got no one to help him until Snow came over and started helping him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.560" offset="5729573">Now, he got this babbitt pot on the floor, this cast iron pot on the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.424" offset="5749112">Mr. Guthrie said it fell, that did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.295" offset="5760502">It couldn't have fallen more than three of four inches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.002" offset="5767398">It started lowering it and got it down and drop three or four inches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.239" offset="5780355">Snow, who is in the same room when it -- didn't even hear it fall, but that doesn't matter because of the fact that the babbitt pot landed exactly where he wanted it if he'd lowered it, it would have been right there, that's where he testified, it was where he wanted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.846" offset="5830719">Nobody was injured then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.308" offset="5840645">It was ready for the new pot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.374" offset="5848900">Now, Deen is a good man and instead of waiting until the storeroom crew showed up with the -- a new pot, he started to turn it over and it's too heavy for him, so Snow came over and they gave it a pull.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.427" offset="5921102">Now, there's nothing complicated, it couldn't be anything more simple than dumping an oblong butter pot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.000" offset="5951404">We've all dumped (Inaudible) or hoist it up, you just get hold of it and come over with it and she pops over and once in, runs out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.196" offset="5988185">Now, that's just what he was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.609" offset="5997798">Actually in this particular time, he tried to turn it away from him as he had done when he had adequate help.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.989" offset="6023293">In which case the -- of course the -- the babbitt pot falls away from him and doesn't landed on his leg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.971" offset="6051297">But because they're only two there they had to get hold of it, and I have stepped back a little bit to show the position, except I believe it was this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.109" offset="6083793">They got back and pulled it with this hand and came over like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.542" offset="6101556">I'm getting a little high but not like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.197" offset="6112110">And just as it got upright, Deen said, “Watch out for your toes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.154" offset="6131963">Almost instantaneously the slab of babbitt came out which is what he was trying to accomplish and fell on his leg because his leg was in front of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.755" offset="6166444">Now, that's the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.620" offset="6185880">That's the lawsuit until we get to try it before a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.717" offset="6198209">Now, in Texas you try all civil cases on special issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.699" offset="6230183">Special issues are questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.939" offset="6243140">The special issues are formed from the pleadings of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.394" offset="6260903">The plaintiff by his pleading sets the language in which these special issues will be submitted on primary liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.162" offset="6296012">The defendant by his pleading sets the form or the language in which the issues will be submitted on -- in defense, the defensive issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.716" offset="6338226">The Court has to submit them the way they're pled in other words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.539" offset="6353481">And that's what the Court did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.475" offset="6361318">They submitted them in his language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.949" offset="6371140">Now, the bitter attack in this case on the Court of Civil Appeals is the decision of the Court of Civil Appeals which appears at page 181 of the record and since that is the principal attack and without that he gets nowhere I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.975" offset="6443238">I'm going to take -- it starts at the bottom of 180, the actual language at the top of 181.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.453" offset="6465181">And this is the Court of Civil Appeals' holding, “As heretofore shown, the jury found the railroad company did not fail to furnish more men to assist Deen in removing the babbitt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.796" offset="6498513">That it did not fail to give Deen proper supervision at the time of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.969" offset="6515231">That Deen was negligent in failing to obtain additional help to remove the babbitt and that such negligence was the proximate cause of his injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.109" offset="6543757">We think said answers considered in connection with the record must be construed as a finding that sufficient men were available to help Deen remove the babbitt with safety.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.774" offset="6586493">Now, that's what the Court of Civil Appeals construed this jury verdict has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.145" offset="6603943">I've got to go back and explain another thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.731" offset="6618258">I -- I'm accused by petitioner here of having trying to initiate this Court into the intricacies of Texas special issue practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.146" offset="6655979">And I either had to put it in my brief or rely on Mr. Justice Clark's recollection and I thought it's safer to put it in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.421" offset="6693073">That will excuse some of the things that are in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.845" offset="6706761">Now, what happens when you get a special issue verdict in Texas is that under our rules, the court, trial court renders judgment as is required and this is a rule that's quoted in the substance as is required by the jury's findings, the pleadings in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.590" offset="6777710">It has to conform to all three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.050" offset="6787532">Now, the trial court, I made a motion for judgment on the verdict, so did the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.996" offset="6807385">I made a judgment on a motion for staying a judgment on the verdict or disregarding issues one, two, and three which were the -- two of the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.965" offset="6843225">The trial court heard them and he said that the verdict was for the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.851" offset="6862764">Now, that's what we appealled from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.227" offset="6872273">That was what the appeal to the Court of Civil Appeals was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.828" offset="6886693">That decision by the trial court is reviewable on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.251" offset="6904351">The Court of Civil Appeals took those findings in light of the pleadings and evidence and said that that verdict was the one for the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2849.980" offset="11503261">But instead of telling the jury in general language that you must -- that you must find whether the -- the plaintiff committed a certain act or the defendant committed a certain act and whether this is negligence and whether that is a proximate cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2951.957" offset="11911189">Now, we -- the -- the tools that we say we were entitled to is at the -- the hoist which was furnished for the railway should be so equipped that -- that when it lifted the steel pot with the babbitt off the furnace and that it could turn it over itself rather than have manual labor to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.717" offset="12010245">Now, the blacksmith for the railway company said he could have made the clamps right there in his own blacksmith shop, they could have been fitted on the pot and permitted it to be turned over.</text>

            <text syncTime="3006.951" offset="12131140">And so, Your Honor, there were issues of fact on -- on proper tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.238" offset="12156322">Now, this exact question had come before the -- the Court of Civil Appeals of Texas in 1928 and it involved the hoist just like this did, an inexperienced in a -- workers for the railway company this was a hoist that was used to lift the timber on the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.129" offset="12235839">They had two chains that came down from the hoist and chains would fit on each side of the timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.513" offset="12261439">And one of the chains slipped and the man -- the timber fell and struck the injured workman in his back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.134" offset="12287875">The railway company used the same defense there that it did in this case, they said the -- in our case he ought not to have stuck his leg in the way of the falling babbitt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.914" offset="12322983">In that case they said that the man ought not to have stood in the way of the falling timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.204" offset="12344195">But anyway, a fellow workman in that case said that if the hoist had been equipped with the chain at the top with a -- a ring at the top so that the chain couldn't have slipped, that the accident couldn't have happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.783" offset="12402500">Now, the railway company in that case, Your Honor, put on the evidence as to -- scientific evidence which they said would show that this chain could not be -- that this ring could not be used and it was not a proper way of doing it.</text>
