            <label>Mr. Ben Margolis</label>
            <text syncTime="129.871" offset="623867">I believe that is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.476" offset="638286">However, counsel may disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.640" offset="650930">This is the first Smith Act case of course since Dennis that this Court has agreed to hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.144" offset="684993">I think that the Court should know at the outset that the indictment in this case, names all of the defendants in the Dennis case as co-conspirators with the defendants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.976" offset="756255">The theory of the respondent has been at all stages of this case that the conspiracy charged in this case is identical with the one in Dennis sustained by the decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.504" offset="822397">It might be wrong then at the outset to consider to what extent the facts in this case and those in the Dennis case are similar than to what extent they're differ.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.513" offset="886450">There are, in my opinion, only two facts common to both cases, two general facts.One is that in both cases all of the defendants were admittedly members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.495" offset="962414">No issue in Dennis about that and no issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.630" offset="978923">The second is, that in both cases essentially the same books, the so-called “Marxist-Leninist” books were introduced into evidence and essentially the same passages from those books are relied upon by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.832" offset="1063769">I believe that there is no other fact of consequence that is the same in the two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.984" offset="1100340">The differences are numerous as a comparison of the findings in Dennis remembering that the Court did not pass upon the sufficiency of the events on that case, but accepted the findings of the Court of Appeals and acted upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.439" offset="1170139">So we take a comparison of the findings in Dennis with the record in this case where the Court has agreed to review the sufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.332" offset="1217682">In Dennis, it was found, and may I say at the outset that the Court said in Dennis that these findings were essential to its decision to the finding that the statute as applied was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.996" offset="1288422">The first finding is that the petitioners were the leaders of the Communist Party of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.864" offset="1315903">That they were all members of a small, compact, top governing body.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.883" offset="1347877">This was charged in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.915" offset="1356027">This was the undisputed evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.713" offset="1367207">This -- they were all members of the group known as the National Board of the Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.116" offset="1396882">None of the defendants, none of the petitioners in this case are or ever were members of that body.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.025" offset="1428543">During the period within the statute of limitations of the 11 petitioners who I represent, only four -- first of all not a single one of them held any national position, not one.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.046" offset="1464592">Only four held positions as officials of the state organization, the California State Organization of the Communist Party and they were members of the state committee of that Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.900" offset="1544004">Of the remaining six, there is evidence that two others, on some occasions, attended meetings of that state committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.831" offset="1583710">Of the remaining petitioners, five held offices and the highest level of which was the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.714" offset="1623207">They were county officials in the County of Los Angeles or County of San Franscisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.140" offset="1644941">Two never held any officers above a city level.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.667" offset="1671064">And whereas in Dennis, there was the common relationship between all of the defendants in that case by reason not only of their common membership on the National Board but by reason of their acts as found, as members of the National Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.748" offset="1747341">In this record, there is nothing showing common activity on the part of these petitioners at least in the same sense, unless that common activity be that they were all members of the Communist Party and as members of the Communist Party independently within the Communist Party carried on certain activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.180" offset="1853085">The Dennis case proceeds also upon the finding that the petitioners on that case, and I believe these are the words used by the Court, were unwilling to work within the framework of democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.029" offset="1924556">I am not here discussing the sufficiency of the findings in Dennis, this Court didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.095" offset="1944827">We must assume for the purpose of the argument that they were supported by the record and this Court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.162" offset="1969068">Here, the record is replete with statements of support for, and work, and plans all within the framework about democratic process relating to legislation, relating to running for office, relating to discussion of various issues which were current controversial issues being decided within the framework of our democratic process with these petitioners taking their part in making that decision, small, minority, and popularism might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.904" offset="2124027">As a matter of fact, a great deal of this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.889" offset="2139909">In fact perhaps a major portion of this evidence with respect to the almost total preoccupation of these defendants with their activities within the framework of our democratic process, came from respondent's witnesses and as a result of their direct examination, because of the theory which respondent proceeds on in this case, and that is, that any activity within the Communist Party, according to the respondent, is evidence of participation in the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.554" offset="2270626">This is a subject that I'll come back to a number of times during the course of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.295" offset="2293614">Next, there was a finding in the Dennis case that the defendants there intended to initiate a violent revolution whenever the propitious occasion occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.719" offset="2347321">Now that finding did not result from independent evidence of intent, but as the decision indicates was a finding which arose out of the other findings of the activities of the petitioners in that case of the Dennis defendants, that is their activities as members of the National Board, their advocacy and the other findings that I referred to here.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.316" offset="2457663">In other words, intent came as a direct result there of findings of fact, none of which are present in this case, none of which can be supported by the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.821" offset="2511684">Moreover, concededly that intent could be deduced from findings of activities other than those which it was found the Dennis defendants' engagement.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.678" offset="2567064">But I believe we will demonstrate, I believe -- I believe our brief demonstrates that there is no basis for any finding with respect to anyone of these petitioners resulting from their activities, resulting from their knowledge as shown by the evidence to support a finding of this kind of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.562" offset="2658597">Next was probably the most important single finding made in Dennis.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.510" offset="2686391">In Dennis, this Court may remember, the indictment was returned, I believe, some three days short or three years after the reconstitution of the Communist Party just barely in time to bring that reconstitution within the limits of the statute of limitations if in fact the Government intended to rely probably on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.011" offset="2800389">And the finding that was made with respect to these laws, that these defendants, these members of the top governing board, use their control of the Communist Political Association, which has been organized in 1944 some 13 or 14 months earlier as a result of the dissolution of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.685" offset="2891086">That they had used their control of the Communist Political Association to change it from an organization which had a policy of peaceful cooperation with the Government of the United States and a peaceful change within the democratic framework of the United States to one which worked for the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.458" offset="2978231">In other words what they said, this Court said here, here are the small group of men who set down, they control the Communist Political Association, this was a lawful organization engaging in rights, in activities protected by the Constitution of the United States and by their control, they changed it to an organization the object of which was to accomplish the forceful overthrow of our Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.936" offset="3084184">How about the record here?</text>
            <text syncTime="747.209" offset="3093274">First of all, there is not one word of evidence to indicate that anyone of the petitioners in this case exercised to any extent the kind of control that the petitioners in Dennis were found to have exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.567" offset="3158685">There is no evidence in this case that anyone of them had anything to do with bringing about such a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.065" offset="3192644">There is no evidence that they denied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.105" offset="3204765">As a matter of fact as I have pointed out, only four of the individuals were even members of the state committee, of the 11 I represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.338" offset="3249800">And there is no evidence that the state committee of the Communist Party did anything to change the Communist Political Association from an organization which believe in peaceful advocacy, of peaceful change to one which worked for the overthrow of the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.229" offset="3325346">Next and this is rather interesting point although I have sometimes been in doubt about its full significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.282" offset="3369545">The Dennis indictment, the Dennis findings were, that the conspiracy was initiated in 1945 with the reconstitution of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.392" offset="3413953">I want the finding that the Communist Political Association that fourteenth-month period was not a period when any conspiracy as far as that organization was concerned or anything in relation to it was in action.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.230" offset="3481349">And as a matter of fact, as I pointed out, that reconstitution of the Communist Party was the key evidence in Dennis.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.176" offset="3513114">Here, when the original indictment was returned, it was alleged that the conspiracy began in 1945 on the same date that was alleged in the Dennis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.496" offset="3558358">That indictment was dismissed because of the failure to allege intent, and a new indictment was returned some months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.973" offset="3584272">And in that indictment, it was alleged that the conspiracy began in 1940, I don't recall the exact date but it was the date when the Smith Act became effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.065" offset="3628680">The theory of the respondent apparently be, that the conspiracy was in existence for sometime prior to that date but that it became unlawful upon the Smith Act becoming effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.562" offset="3690642">In the Dennis case, it was found that Communist Party was a highly disciplined organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.366" offset="3721885">That the Dennis defendants controlled it and that they would tolerate no dissension from the policies laid down by them, but instead that they insisted that the program be slavishly followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.810" offset="3771622">I say that there is just no proof of that in this record, just no evidence of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.388" offset="3797953">As a matter of fact, from respondent's own witnesses, there appears a tremendous amount of evidence concerning many differences of opinion among members of the Communist Parties, considerable dissension on various issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.261" offset="3857408">It is true that there is evidence showing that the Communist Party exercised this right to expel certain persons from its organization just trade unions and other organizations from time to time exercise the right to expel some of their members.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.104" offset="3944761">But the significant thing is the basis for the expulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.031" offset="3968481">They were of three kinds.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.985" offset="3980288">They were those who wanted to advocate socialism that socialism be established now when a majority of the people was opposed to it, instead of indicating a willingness to wait for advocating the establishment of socialism until such time as it was believed that the American people would want by a majority, by an overwhelming majority to have socialism established.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.772" offset="4083524">These people who didn't want to wait were the ones who were expelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.079" offset="4108706">Then there were certain informers and spies and their character, I think, has been evidenced by some recent developments before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.210" offset="4149248">There were certain informers and spies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.954" offset="4160219">They were expelled from this organization as I think they would be expelled from any organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.711" offset="4183207">And finally, there was the expulsion of a person who carried a gun, and who discriminated against Negroes and those were the charges they give.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.143" offset="4225003">Now if that indicates iron control, then it also indicates the character of the iron control exercise within the Communist Party in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.088" offset="4280696">It was found in Dennis that the petitioners in that case were adept at infiltration into strategic positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.920" offset="4324059">There just no evidence of that here, just none of any adeptness, of any willful infiltration into strategic positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.506" offset="4366378">It was found in Dennis that the petitioners there used aliases in order to cover up their work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.523" offset="4390515">There is no such evidence here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.867" offset="4403890">It was found in Dennis and this I think is a matter of very great importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.055" offset="4432624">That the petitioners in that case used double meaning language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.377" offset="4461881">Now that was predicated upon the testimony of one (Inaudible), who testified that on the basis of his association with the petitioners in that case, he knew that when they talk in favor of peaceful change, they didn't mean it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.599" offset="4570760">They meant violence instead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.423" offset="4582045">He said he knew them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.825" offset="4587687">This was a very important bit of testimony in the reason that it was so important in that case, is that in 1945 when the Communist Party was reconstituted, in 1945 when the Communist Party was reconstituted, it adopted a constitution and that constitution stated that the Party predicated itself upon Marxism-Leninism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.138" offset="4724987">And it also stated that it favored the achievement of socialism in the United States through winning a majority of the people to that end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.730" offset="4767305">It also adopted provisions for the expulsion from the organization of advocates of force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.813" offset="4799697">Now (Inaudible) explained all of these away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.747" offset="4811400">He said that was protective coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.991" offset="4824357">Whether his testimony was truthful or not, it's not before us, but he said this is protective coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.969" offset="4844314">This people who whined didn't mean this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.333" offset="4857689">Marxism-Leninism is the key there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.457" offset="4870228">He says, “I know when they used the word Marxism-Leninism, they meant overthrow the Government by force and violence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.616" offset="4902828">And this other language was just been put in there to fool people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.802" offset="4923622">There is no such evidence in this case, none whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.427" offset="4942117">There is no evidence insofar as this case is concerned that the Constitution of the Communist Party, when it said that it favored the achievement of socialism by winning the majority to that end, when it indicated, it's our position to advocate force and violence meant anything else to the petitioners than what it said, not one word of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.659" offset="5047024">Finally, there was a finding in Dennis that the defendants in that case advocated force and violence by statements and activities of the leaders and by literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.550" offset="5122570">Now, as I will show a little more detail here as much detailed if time will allow, there were no such statements here by any of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.621" offset="5162904">It is true that the essentially the same Marxist-Leninist books and passages are relied upon in the two cases and to that extent, the two cases are similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.278" offset="5225493">But it is also true that in this case, there is literature of the Communist Party introduced both by the respondent itself and by the defendants in the case indicating that the American Communist Party or at least indicating a position from which it would be possible to conclude very reasonably that the American Communist Party does not favor in fact disposed to the use of force and violence as long as democratic processes are open and as long as our present form of Government exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.361" offset="5377839">And there was an article by Mrs.Yates, the defendant whose name leads all the rest in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.891" offset="5415978">In which she took issue with a group who recalled the (Inaudible) who were expelled who said, “We want to fight for socialism now”, and in which he said, “No, you can't educate the majority of the American people for socialism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.231" offset="5473343">You've got to win them to that.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1377.500" offset="5614404">There was much other material of the Party there which indicated men of these petitioners, which indicated their view that they favored peaceful change, that they favored socialism, is -- is on question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.873" offset="5671873">But that they favored peaceful changes a method of achieving it is what we contend the record shows and what the respondent disputes.For example, there is evidence that when the Schneiderman decision came down, one of the defendants here being the Schneiderman, being Mr. Schneiderman, this was welcomed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.112" offset="5740837">And what was stated as a tenable conclusion there was stated by petitioners here to be their own view of what Marxism-Leninism meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.663" offset="5779080">There are many other instances of this kind which time does not permit me to go into.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.859" offset="5803844">It is my position in short that not a single one of the basic facts which this Court found were essential to the sustaining of the convictions in the Dennis case in holding the statute constitutional as applied, not one of those facts has been proved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.020" offset="5908438">But there are also additional factors that were not present in Dennis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.146" offset="5929023">For example, at the time that the Dennis case was tried, the conspiracy section was a part of the Smith Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.578" offset="5970714">Subsequently, prior to the time of the trial in this case, that was amended out of the Smith Act and the general conspiracy section was applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.654" offset="6027034">The Smith Act conspiracy section required no proof of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.842" offset="6055769">The general conspiracy section which is applicable here, as the Court I'm sure know, does require a proof of an overt act and in furtherance of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.155" offset="6097042">There was no issue in Dennis as to whether such an overt act had been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.710" offset="6115224">Here, there is such an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.983" offset="6124314">And here the issue is this, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.658" offset="6143018">I think that respondent takes the position that any act committed by any petitioner which in any way helps the Communist Party, not helps it towards its illegal objective, but helps it in any way, is an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.783" offset="6223579">And I believe that this presents a new and an important constitutional question of construction and application of this statute both under the First Amendment under due process and simply as a matter of statutory construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1954.890" offset="7923942">For the purpose of this case, although, I don't want to be understood as agreeing with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.496" offset="7966365">Aside from the overt act point, there are -- there are three other or two other respects, important respects in which this case raises very serious legal problems, constitutional problems which are not present in Dennis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.023" offset="8020490">One is, that the organized term, the organized section of the conspiracy the conspiracy charges to -- charges an agreement to organize as the Communist Party of United States an organization which advocates the overthrow of the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.929" offset="8108157">That in Dennis, there was no problem about the meaning of the term “organize”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.365" offset="8129891">Because as used in Dennis and in accordance with the Court's findings there, the word “organize” was applied to the reconstitution of the Communist Party to in effect the creation of a new organization and to giving it the attributes of an organization which advocated the overthrow of the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.186" offset="8217140">Therefore there was no question in that case, about what the word “organize” meant as a matter of statutory construction or what the word “organize” meant or could mean consistently with the requirements of our Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.385" offset="8269908">Here there is such a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.132" offset="8276908">Because here again, under the instructions of the trial judge, virtually any act of a communist which on the any act which gave any assistance for the Communist Party regardless of its purpose, regardless of its mode constituted organization of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.708" offset="8355276">I think that raises serious constitutional statutory question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.290" offset="8373561">Then of course there's the question I hope to discuss at some length that the instruction which was quoted in the Dennis case, the one dealing with the incitement was refused in this case although it was proper both by the Government and by the defendant and no similar instruction was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.293" offset="8461542">Finally, the Court construed clear and present danger differently in my opinion in this case than it was construed in Dennis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.365" offset="8497904">In Dennis, as I understand it, the Court said that in considering whether or not there is a clear and present danger even as they're limited said, you have to look at the nature of the activities of the defendants, their power to bring about the evil, and the objective conditions in the world and the circumstances of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.222" offset="8597274">All of these things had to be considered together as I understand Dennis in determining whether or not a clear and present danger existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.792" offset="8635517">The trial judge in this case ruled that a finding of intent to overthrow the Government by force and violence, plus a finding of an agreement to advocate such overthrow in and of itself and then without regard to anything else, any of the factors, conditions of the world, nature of the activities, power to bring about evil, created a clear and present danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.094" offset="8720781">I believed these two raises most serious questions with respect to the First Amendment on the construction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.941" offset="8748157">Now the respondent in this case has two theories which it urges support the verdicts of the jury and the judgment of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.702" offset="8787237">Neither of these theories, I submit, find any support in Dennis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.616" offset="8802910">And in order to sustain here these theories, it is going to be necessary for this Court or would be necessary for this Court to go far beyond Dennis in the limitations placed upon the right to speak or in the rights given to the Government to punish for the exercise of free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.257" offset="8877411">Now, here's the first theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.001" offset="8888383">They say the Communist Party basis itself of Marxism-Leninism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.398" offset="8913983">And this where it is not in dispute because the Constitution so said the Marxist-Leninist party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.909" offset="8944076">It circulates Marxist-Leninist literature because of this, says the respondent, inferences establishing every element of the offense from connection with the conspiracy to the proscribe contempt can be drawn from leadership in the Communist Party and activity therein regardless of the character of that activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.339" offset="9045744">This was not the Dennis theory, but this is the theory here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.543" offset="9062567">Second, it is argued that certain disconnected oral declarations made by or supposedly made by several of the petitioners, are also sufficient to establish every element of the offense and I want to spend a few minutes -- well, I'm not going to spend a few minutes discussing those because of the time -- well because I want to get on to other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.656" offset="9167057">Let me just simply say that they are discussed in the brief that there isn't one of them that is a clear statement as testified to by an informer and each of them came from the lips of an informer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.714" offset="9235289">There isn't anyone of them that is an unequivocal statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.238" offset="9249395">There isn't any one of them which isn't contradicted by other evidence in the record and each of them constitute and involved a question of interpreting words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.112" offset="9304879">As for example, just to take one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.508" offset="9314388">Well one of the defendants is supposed to have said, I want to see the overthrow of this lousy system as badly as anyone else, but the time for militant action has not yet arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.401" offset="9362035">Now, this particular petitioner to indicate the strength or the weakness of the respondent's case was a long time member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.875" offset="9399860">He has been a member of the Communist Party since 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.410" offset="9418041">Fifteen years during which time the Party was riddled with informers and people who later testified against their former associates, who had every opportunity to observe what this defendant and every other defendant in this case said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.738" offset="9483348">And during the entire fifteen-year period they come up with this one equivocal sentence which says “The time for militant action has not yet arrived” and the use of this word “militant” incidentally by a man whose main activity was in the trade union where the word “militant” as anyone who knows anything about trade union activity is a common word which has no necessary association with force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.266" offset="9577493">If things of this kind as loose, as weak, as inferior in quality of evidence because they consist entirely of all declaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.499" offset="9626394">And incidentally, there is not a single one of such declaration within the period of the statute of limitations except as to one defendant and the evidence was limited as to him, that's the defendant -- the petitioner Lambert.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.238" offset="9693372">So that during the entire period the statute of limitations among all of these people, these eleven people that I represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.874" offset="9715942">There is this one equivocal statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2625.169" offset="10605046">Well, I -- I -- sorry I would like to discuss the specific incidents, but only time prevents me from doing so, they're fully covered in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.260" offset="10641408">Now, I want to turn to -- I want to say this before leaving these specific incidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.711" offset="10679233">These specific incidents involved only five of the petitioners and are in no way tied up to the other six unless any statement made by any communist is -- by virtue of the fact that was made by communist attributable to any other communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.705" offset="10751227">It's -- it's tied in to the other six in no way whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.859" offset="10763870">It has not shown that they knew of them, it has not shown that they approved of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.984" offset="10780379">It is not shown that they had anything whatsoever to do with these statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.891" offset="10791978">And with respect to the six of the petitioners, it is our position that there is absolutely nothing in the record other than evidence of party membership, the holding of a kind of offices that I have indicated to you prior and innocent activities within the Party such as supporting certain types of legislation and it is true in some instances distributing Marxist-Leninist books but never with any advocacy or any interpretation of them has advocated the overthrow of the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.050" offset="10920605">Now, even as to these six, the respondent's position is that the evidence is ample.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.719" offset="10951220">It is our position however, that unless the nature of petitioner's activities is given no weight than they were given weight in Dennis that unless Section 4 (f) of the Internal Security Act which is a new provision since Dennis and which provides that membership per se is not criminal, membership of a Communist Party per se is not criminal unless that proposition and the proposition of guilt is personal or both abandoned, unless the requirement of clear and unequivocal proof where First Amendment rights are involved is discarded unless the clear presentation of rule is completely abolished and unless a presumption of guilt is substituted for a presumption of innocence so far as communists are concerned, there is nothing in this record to support the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.111" offset="11144840">The membership in a conspiracy consists of adherents to an agreement, to a common agreement here to an agreement to advocate the overthrow of the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.952" offset="11184232">Membership and officership in the Communist Party is not the equivalent of although the respondent treats it as the equivalent of adherents to an agreement to violate the law in that respect or in any other respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.787" offset="11239508">Nor is leadership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.499" offset="11246404">Some point is made in the reply brief of these people weren't merely members and officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.467" offset="11266257">They were leaders of the Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.999" offset="11272422">Well they were leaders I suppose in a small way, but at least absent evidence of use of that leadership towards the forbidden objective the fact that they were leaders lends not one iota of support to the respondent case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.090" offset="11344729">Because our position is that if membership in the Communist Party is per se lawful and if the activities which are engaged in are per se lawful, you cannot by combining the two create some kind of a chemical reaction which imposes criminology upon the compound resulting from innocent membership plus innocent activities, but this is precisely the Government's theory here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.094" offset="11472729">Now, I think it is fair to say that the main basis for the respondent's position is to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.860" offset="11531870">These people were long time members, officers of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.375" offset="11549947">Communist Party adheres to Marxism-Leninism reasonable to infer that they knew about the Party adheres from Marxism-Leninism and they wouldn't have remained long time members and officers of the Communist Party unless they agree with that adherence, the Marxism-Leninism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.591" offset="11622776">Next, they say, “Take all of these Marxist-Leninist words.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.667" offset="11643047">None of them say directly and this is an important point I believe, none of them say directly that the Communist Party or that Marxist-Leninist theory is, that the Government of the United States should be overthrown by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.507" offset="11702397">No such statement can be found in any of these books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.130" offset="11712951">But they say that when you read these books, this is the only possible interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.025" offset="11732490">This is only thing that Marxism-Leninism can possibly mean and therefore by remaining long time members, officers and leaders of a Communist Party these -- they can be inferred that they agreed with Marxism-Leninism and interpreted in this way, became part of a conspiracy they have in their requisite intent, all of that series of inferences drawn from their continued membership in the Communist Party and its distribution of and support of Marxist-Leninist works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.487" offset="11854326">Well, I think one problem with this theory is that actually it broadens the conspiracy beyond the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.836" offset="11887762">If under it, if it is accepted anybody who admits adherents to Marxism-Leninism, thereby labels himself a criminal and there many besides Communist both in the United States and throughout the world who claim to be adherence of Marxism-Leninism and who fact say that the Communist have started Marxism-Leninism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.241" offset="11981385">But if there's only one possible meaning to Marxism-Leninism that anybody who says, “I am a Marxist-Leninist”, is thereby rendered a criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.202" offset="12013255">But it is also contrary to the law and to facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.896" offset="12027988">It forces the respondent to say Schneiderman is of yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.373" offset="12053901">Schneiderman when which it was held that a tenable conclusion is that Marxism-Leninism does not stand for this forbidden advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.546" offset="12094548">And there's much evidence in the record to support a similar finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.083" offset="12116699">But I like to spend the moment or two on just the basic theory that of the respondent's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.611" offset="12142822">If you will examine the kind of passages that have been introduced into evidence here, you will find that they are one of two kinds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.892" offset="12191932">Either they refer to force and violence in a specific situation having no relationship to United States where there is a tyrannical form of Government, where there are different historical conditions, whether is no opportunity for changes of the democratic process or they consist of the broadest kind of generalities, talking about the capitalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.787" offset="12283570">Now it is our position that you cannot form such generalities draw a conclusion, that they have only one meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.932" offset="12328082">Certainly, the First Amendment is such a generality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.266" offset="12341457">Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech and there are some with whom this Court is familiar who have said that can only mean one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.826" offset="12379700">Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.760" offset="12395478">But this Court said in Dennis that the right to free speech is not an unlimited, unqualified right, but must on occasion be subordinated to other values and considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.247" offset="12441349">Yet the respondent here insist that as far as these petitioners are concerned only one in construction and that the construction of the petitioners, from selected passages, from selected books must be the one which the petitioners adopted even though there is in the record here a great deal of testimony, a great deal of evidence in the form of exhibits and a great deal of testimony form witnesses including their own witnesses indicating the Marxism-Leninism can be and has been interpreted differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.799" offset="12575619">One of their principle witnesses, the man by the name of Honig said that when he was a member of the Communist Party and he was a high official in the Communist Party, he believed that there was a 75% chance and he hoped 100% for -- for peaceful changes to socialism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.942" offset="12644164">He believed that violence would only come if a minority started against the majority when they wanted socialism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.149" offset="12673003">And that he had talked to many leaders of the Party and that they had agreed with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.548" offset="12694632">If there is one -- one thing that has never been explained here, if the respondent's witnesses could have so believe, why is it that the petitioners must be assumed arbitrarily to believe otherwise when there is absolutely no evidence to support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.041" offset="12752520">I want to turn for a moment to the instruction on sight that my time is just about up, and I think this is one of the most important thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.991" offset="12788360">Both the Government and the defendants in this case asked an instruction be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.902" offset="12827961">That the law punishes only advocacy or conspiracy to advocate action for the accomplishment of the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force and violence by language reasonably and ordinarily calculated to incite persons to such action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.521" offset="12898492">Now this is -- this is the instruction that was given in Dennis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.616" offset="12918868">This was refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.209" offset="12929212">Not only was this refused, instructions to the same effect in various other forms were submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.507" offset="12958469">And the trial judge refused to give any instruction which indicated that advocacy of action as distinguished from advocacy of abstract doctrine and advocacy of ideas was the kind of advocacy of which the statute was asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.728" offset="13027328">Not a single instruction that he gave.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.620" offset="13038926">I call -- I want to call the Court's attention to the fact that at pages and I hope to read it but I won't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.647" offset="13062959">At pages 69 and 70 of the respondent's reply in the Mesarosh, which will be argued shortly, 69 and 70.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.727" offset="13103292">This same respondent in another case in which the issue was a different one, the issue there is sufficiency of the evidence that show incitement concedes, it seems to me that the kind of instruction that we ask for -- what the respondent asked for, was essential to a proper construction of the statute by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.298" offset="13177584">Because what this -- what the Court left in the minds of the jury was, that they could find these defendants guilty even though all that they advocated were ideas which could be answered by ideas.</text>

            <text syncTime="3642.722" offset="14675237">I'm the man who argue Steinberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.475" offset="14686312">And it has been said it's well-known that Mr. Schneiderman was here before and the last time he was here, he was represented by Mr. Wendell Willkie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.188" offset="14737199">History treated me rather gently because back in 1940, I lost the case of Schneiderman in the trial court and Mr. Willkie took it one in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.040" offset="14772517">But Mr. Schneiderman is good enough to let me have one more chance and he's let me argue it this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.970" offset="14796236">I don't know but he may have somebody warming up in case the case comes here the third time but I am going to discuss particularly the res judicata or to be more specifically the collateral estoppel point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.810" offset="14871677">Let's think first what was litigated before in the Schneiderman case, that is the Schneiderman denaturalization case before this Court in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.202" offset="14909189">The thing that was litigated before was Schneiderman's beliefs on the crucial issue of the advocacy of force and violence and issues before were did Communist Party membership equal to such advocacy into that this Court said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.708" offset="14983272">The Court said they could still be a member of the Communist Party and could still be attach to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.966" offset="15012216">Well the issue was could he advocate the doctrines of Marxist-Leninist, Marxism-Leninism according to his interpretation of them as still not be advocating force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.788" offset="15055579">And to that this Court said, “Yes, he could advocate Marxism-Leninism according his interpretation and he could be still be attach to the Constitution.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.430" offset="15102077">And now it's because this Court said and there this is the language of the tenable conclusion language has been cited so many times thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.190" offset="15133111">This Court held then a tenable conclusion is that the part -- that the Party in 1927 desired to achieve its purpose by peaceful and democratic means and as a theoretical matter justified the use of force and violence only as a method of preventing an attempted forcible counter overthrow once the Party had obtained control in a peaceful manner or as a matter -- as a method last resort to enforce the majority will if at some indefinite time in the future because peculiar circumstances, constitutional or peaceful can't offer no longer open.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.144" offset="15276993">This is the tenable conclusion the Court said, could we reach out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.280" offset="15297473">The last thing is what was the evidence in the first Schneiderman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.096" offset="15320775">Well it was the same Marxist-Leninist classics that the Government has relied upon the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.925" offset="15352121">And it was from those same books which were quoted at length by this Court in footnotes in the original Schneiderman case that this Court was able to adjudicate this tenable conclusion that I've just read.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.328" offset="15397679">In other words that a tenable conclusion that Schneiderman was not advocating force and violence could be derived from these -- these -- the same books which were the evidence again in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.113" offset="15452850">Now as what was litigated this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.949" offset="15472180">This time, Schneiderman's intent is litigate as against belief, they're both states in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.057" offset="15500601">And it was his intent again on this same crucial issue of the advocacy of force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.130" offset="15532889">The issues this time where did his membership and officership in the Communist Party provide, prove ipso facto that he intended to advocate force and violence, and did his advocacy of Marxism-Leninism prove that he indented to advocate force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.325" offset="15617735">Now our point on this collateral estoppels as we say that on those issues, Schneiderman was protected from a relitigation by his Government unless the Government produced proof this time of some different interpretation by him, of the same mold Marxist-Leninist books.</text>
            <text syncTime="3900.039" offset="15704566">The matter that was litigated before and on which point Schneiderman won before was that his circulation of these books would not have advocacy of overthrow by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.285" offset="15757542">And thereafter we contend that as long as he merely repeated his formal conduct, that is the conduct which has been adjudicated lawful by this Court as long as he repeated that merely repeated that conduct he was protected by the formal decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3930.904" offset="15827968">However, the evidence this time that same -- same old books, and the books which have been litigated once.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.922" offset="15860046">It's true in the Government's brief they talk of new books but they're glossed over and they're not cited because the really violent language, it was ever to be found were these old European classics and the books that have been written since 1927, are more on the side of the tenable conclusion and then the -- than the earlier works which were --</text>

            <text syncTime="4680.530" offset="18826512">Your Honors please.</text>
            <text syncTime="4682.733" offset="18835289">In our opening brief and prior thereto on over a period of months, we made a very, very meticulous examination of this record, last came.</text>
            <text syncTime="4696.872" offset="18891922">Each and every possible bit of evidence in a voluminous record that it could or did by inference or otherwise applied to our particular petitioners, Richmond and Connelly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4710.908" offset="18948033">Richmond was the editor in San Francisco of the Daily People's World and Connelly the editor of the Daily People's World in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4723.842" offset="18999756">They are members of the Communist Party and have been for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4730.132" offset="19024938">And they as such have been minor officials here and there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4736.730" offset="19051269">The newspaper, both editions are the sponsored papers of the Communist Party in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4746.621" offset="19090871">Now, we did in our opening brief, set forth everything that we could possibly find in this record and I'm sure we got it all because the Government found no difficulty except the few cases, where few spots where we will show that, a sort of it reflects more the other way, that we stated and discuss in detail, all of the possible and tenable inferences that might come or arise, or would have attack or approach any legal mind from the evidence of what they said, did or wrote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.950" offset="19264219">It is admitted by the Government, on page 112 of its brief, did not one word in the newspaper ever advocated or innovated any advocacy of violence whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="4802.504" offset="19314375">We contend that not one bid evidence will respect to these two many in anyway, in first, violence or advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4811.243" offset="19349379">The only thing you can say about these men is, they are members of the Communist Party, they have been members of the Communist Party for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4821.694" offset="19391175">There is not one item or evidence in these whole records, showing any act, deed, word written or spoken by them in any manner, shape or form can be labored into an advocacy of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4838.452" offset="19458152">On the contrary, on the contrary, they wrote in their newspaper matters concerning the Taft-Hartley Act, labored bills, the recognition of colored people's rights, the recognition of Mexican-Americans, the things that are matters of public consequence and interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4862.827" offset="19555746">Sometimes they are on the minor side.</text>
            <text syncTime="4865.781" offset="19567553">I do not believe that is a crime to be on the short side of the things and be a sorry day in America when the only safe place in the world is on bandwagon.</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.212" offset="19605274">And it seems to me, that outside of the general idea that they were members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="4884.132" offset="19640905">And that the Communist Party proclaimed that was based on Marxism-Leninism, there is literally nothing in this record with respect to these defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4896.777" offset="19691478">Now then, Communism as to be a member of the party, I assumed from the discussion is not primeval.</text>
            <text syncTime="4907.539" offset="19734528">Now then, the question then becomes, if you construed Marxism-Leninism, in what way did you construe it?</text>
            <text syncTime="4916.720" offset="19771308">It is capable as the record shows of many types of construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4921.486" offset="19790326">Some of them innocents and void of any invalidity or any force of violence, you might say that when you take these books applying to another country, in another year, almost a century ago, that could be interpretative in various ways, to select from that and take all of its context certain thoughts and ignore others, and put them in the United States of 50 or 60 years later and put them in the mind of somebody who said nothing and does nothing to in the case interpretation, you are going along way to create a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4956.812" offset="19931596">You are making a criminal case, you are not insisting on the tenable evidence rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4962.238" offset="19953330">That if rule is consider -- that rule should be, I believe that is, we have discussed that fully in our brief, that if the evidences consisted with innocence or are tenable inference of innocence, can be drawn from the evidence as you go from once place along when the guy got county, testing it out, here then and the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.449" offset="20038175">If inferences of innocence can be interpreted in to each act, then you should never give in that case to jury for a guessing contest in these inflammatory times, in the case of that time, with all the atmosphere that existed at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5001.225" offset="20109333">It seems to me that this record shows that these two petitioners, as we analyze it tonight, would do wish a very careful reading about briefs because we have intended to analyze every conceivable inference that could be drawn from the various testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="5017.513" offset="20174430">And in any matter either, directly or indirectly reflects upon our two defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="5023.670" offset="20199090">And I believe you will ask to change and come to the conclusion, that from that record, and in each instance and each reference to us, the tenable inference of innocence from any sort of things such as the conspiracy, can be concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="5040.647" offset="20267008">And having that in mind, it seems to me it was the duty of the trial Court, not to present this to a jury of the law under any conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5050.238" offset="20305356">And to permit them to speculate on a set of facts or set of evidence of that kind of character.</text>
            <text syncTime="5057.565" offset="20334613">Now then, there is no evidence in the record of this case, that either petitioner Richmond, petitioner Connelly, and were expressly advocated violent overthrow of our government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5069.778" offset="20383514">There is no evidence of either of them ever said anything construable as advocacy of violent overthrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="5077.276" offset="20413503">Putting aside the question, whether doctrine or Marxism-Leninism or in any sense equitable with advocacy of force and violence, there is no evidence connecting either petitioner with the study, teaching or advocacy of Marxism-Leninism.</text>
            <text syncTime="5092.158" offset="20473062">There is no evidence in this case that either petitioner was present at any meeting or anyone else expressly advocated forceful overthrow of the Government, or said anything interpretable as so advocating or thought studied or are advocated the doctrines of Marxism-Leninism.</text>
            <text syncTime="5109.667" offset="20543070">There is no evidence that the Daily People's World, the newspaper would which petition were connected, ever contained one word, either express or implied advocating brought of revolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5120.411" offset="20586015">Of that, if this record is carefully analyzed, with respect to the fact, that this is a criminal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5129.051" offset="20620601">And this is a type of a case, that all know it, we have no such thing as a changer, it is a changer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5137.243" offset="20653411">And finding of guilt goes to the third generation of this type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5142.779" offset="20675563">No case requires greater chair, with respect to the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5147.505" offset="20694371">And no case requires a higher responsibility to keep from a jury, possible going to speculate on the set of facts, if the facts are such that tenable inferences of innocence can be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="5162.071" offset="20752677">There are as the great duty of the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5165.310" offset="20765633">This case should never have gone to this jury, particularly under those particular circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="5176.943" offset="20812131">In the 1945, and again in ‘48, and I believe, clearly within the statute or beyond the statutes limitations, because it was not ‘48 indictment here with brought in about the last day of two of 730, 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="5194.837" offset="20883707">So, we assume it was in '48 prior to the beginning of the three year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5201.625" offset="20910874">The constitutional of the party of the Communist Party was adopted in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="5212.335" offset="20953715">Section 2 whereas follows, inherence two of participation in the activity as if any click groups circle faction of party, was conscribes to subverts under mind, weaken or overdue any role of the institutions of America, American democracy whereby the majority the American people can maintain their right to determine their destinies in any degree shall be punished by means of expulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5238.753" offset="21059459">Again in '48, something along the same line, again two, Section 3 and Section 9, can be found on page 47 of Mr. Margolis brief, it negates in to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5253.298" offset="21117555">Now, there is nothing here in this record, to show that Richmond and Connelly, did not accept that on its based value.</text>
            <text syncTime="5263.489" offset="21158306">There is no evidence here if that was me or sham or pre chance, nothing of the kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="5269.853" offset="21183801">It almost have to go to the same sort of reasoning that the boss had when he called Perkins in.</text>
            <text syncTime="5275.640" offset="21206998">Perkins came in to the boss's big office.</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.014" offset="21220477">The carpets were very deep.</text>
            <text syncTime="5281.777" offset="21231553">But Perkins walked there and very subserviently stood at the desk.</text>
            <text syncTime="5288.314" offset="21257676">The boss says, Perkins, you have been with us 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5293.590" offset="21278783">You have done everything perfectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5296.684" offset="21291112">You have never been late.</text>
            <text syncTime="5298.886" offset="21299890">You have never asked for overtime.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.509" offset="21310443">You even come here on your vacations and works.</text>
            <text syncTime="5306.675" offset="21331132">You are accounts are perfect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5308.827" offset="21339700">Perkins, what in the world are you up to anything?</text>
            <text syncTime="5312.607" offset="21354851">And that sort of mind, and that sort of attempt, that viewing this evidence, that brings these laborite conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5322.527" offset="21394453">These conclusions are equally text out of the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="5327.133" offset="21412948">To say that, this man intended certain things particularly with the limitation was placed in the Dennis Case as speedily as circumstances would permit, is just to walk the evidence out of all recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5345.734" offset="21487344">It is a labored attempt to merely say, Communist Party, Marxism-Leninism, you are guilty.</text>
