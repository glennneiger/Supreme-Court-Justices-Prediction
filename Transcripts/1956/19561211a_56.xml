            <label>Mr. Norman M. Spindelman</label>
            <text syncTime="19.420" offset="181060">Thank you sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.526" offset="185448">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.426" offset="201122">At the outset of my argument today, I would like to clarify a question asked yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.625" offset="229857">The question was put concerning Appendix F to respondent's brief which is correspondence dealing with UROC's attempt to get a seat on the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.667" offset="270085">Now this appendix was inserted only for one reason and that was to show how complete the control of the qualified organizations is if qualifying for a seat on the Board is the exclusively way in which “national in scope” status can be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.268" offset="360469">Now, Rychlik not UROC is the respondent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.865" offset="382830">And whatever action was taken by UROC to get a seat on the Board has nothing whatsoever to do with Rychlik's right to hold his job if he belongs to a “national in scope” union.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.413" offset="441031">Now just because coincidentally a union must be among other things “national in scope” to get a seat on the Board does not mean that qualifying for such a seat is the exclusive way that “national in scope” status can be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.712" offset="526190">That it is not the exclusively way is convincingly demonstrated by past authority and by reading of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.489" offset="565373">In 1939, the Railroad Retirement Board published regulations which concerned the meaning of the phrase “national in scope” as it was used in the Railroad Retirement Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.884" offset="614902">Those regulations are very specific that Section 3, First (f) qualifying for a seat on the Board is not the exclusive way in which “national in scope” status can be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.340" offset="676760">Now in addition, expert authority also agrees with this contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.689" offset="694105">There was a special board of adjustment convened to decide whether the Railroad Industrial Union which is a union organized in the State of Maryland was a “national in scope” organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.005" offset="747395">Now this special board of adjustment on which experts said decided that this union was not a “national in scope” union.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.413" offset="777070">But in coming to that determination, this board examined that many, many other criteria besides the fact that this union had not qualified for a seat on the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.436" offset="825135">They made a very exhaustive determination of their size, their stationary, whether their officers were full or part time, how many organizers they had in the field, how many locals they had organized, and many, many other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.619" offset="873827">Now in addition, Court authority also confirms that this -- that getting a seat on the Board is not the exclusive way in which “national in scope” status can be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.093" offset="919698">For example, this Court as a manner of fact assumed in Order of Railway conductors versus Swan, that the Railroad Yardmasters of America was a national labor organization despite the fact that that organization at that time did not have any members on the Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.523" offset="1005484">Now in addition, a reading of the Act makes very clear that the terms of the statutes must be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.920" offset="1039026">The wording of the statute must be changed to a great extent if this interpretation is to apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="286.295" offset="1248528">But in the statement of facts, Mr. Justice Murphy speaking for the Court stated that the contention that was presented by the other side is contradicted by the Railroad Yardmasters of America, a national labor organization and that organization has failed to place a representative on any one of the four divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.427" offset="1321044">In other words, it had no representatives on the board but you still refer to it as a national labor organization under the terms of the Railway Labor Act</text>

            <text syncTime="329.509" offset="1421458">And they stated that in UROC versus Pennsylvania Railroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="458.264" offset="1936384">In other words, by suppose for example that the union brought a declaratory judgment action, I think in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="467.736" offset="1974314">But I think in that case, by applying the Secretary of Labor's definition, the Court might proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.427" offset="1993122">And whether they would have jurisdiction in that particular case or not, I do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.207" offset="2008168">I mean, I'm not reaching any -- any point on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.426" offset="2029066">Now as I just said, the emphasis of the petitioner is on this chaos, confusion and uncertainty in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.310" offset="2060622">At the outset, I think the Court should recognize that whatever chaos and confusion and uncertainty comes into the field because of judicial review is caused by the actions of the petitioners themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.414" offset="2113076">In other words, had the petitioners set up a truly impartial board to hear this union shout disputes, this case would not be before this Court now.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.457" offset="2165217">So, it is their own action in attempting to entrench themselves firmly and finely that causes judicial review and causes the very chaos and confusion if there is any chaos and confusion which they are complaining about.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.906" offset="2235016">Now further, we think that there will be no chaos and confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.015" offset="2271483">Yesterday, I explained to the Court, I hoped, that the Secretary of Labor's definition was what Congress intended to incorporate in the expanded language which it used.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.323" offset="2328639">Now, by use of the Secretary of Labor's definition which he made in two cases before the Union Shop Amendment was passed and then consolidated in the third case which was after the Union Shop Amendment was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.222" offset="2376286">In other words, he put it in formal terms of a definition in the third case but he had mentioned the same factors in the previous two.</text>

            <text syncTime="710.013" offset="2943457">And in addition to that, the minority opinion was based up on the fact that the National Labor Relations Board had held that it was a term of art.</text>

            <text syncTime="722.328" offset="2992671">In our field therefore, both majority and minority would agree that it was a generally accepted meaning which controls because here, the Secretary of Labor who was the administrative official-in-charge with this section of the Act has specifically held that this is not a term of art but is used in its generally accepted meaning, in other words under both majority and minority of the Highland Park decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2207.308" offset="8932603">Well I've already have covered that if your Honor please and I think that we can go on to the next point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.322" offset="8952665">As far as bias is concerned in my brief on pages -- on page 10, in the footnote, we have set forth various situations showing where these men sitting in judgment in a situation or in a factual problem in which they are vitally interested in all these different situations, the courts have held, starting with the Tumey against Ohio case in 273 U.S.the Courts have held that such a situation prevents these men from sitting in judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.801" offset="9090591">And on Tumey case as Your Honors know, a judge was interested in the fine that he was going to receive if he found certain people guilty of committing certain traffic violations and the Court held that that is not good as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.630" offset="9149942">And so similarly all the way down to the Murchison case recently in 349 U.S, the Court held that in a case of a one-man grand jury, the judge who cited this man for contempt cannot sit ultimately in the decision of whether he was actually in contempt or not because the Court said that fairness requires an -- an absence of actual bias in the trial of cases and our system of law has always endeavored to prevent the probability of unfairness and that's what we have here that probability of unfairness because these men and they are union men.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.742" offset="9282330">You don't have men in the judicial capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.738" offset="9294346">They are union men, brotherhood men who are saying, “I'm going to see that you're going to lose your job because you belong to another organization and that way, you can't get any place at all.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.238" offset="9328306">And so therefore, we feel that the argument that they make doesn't stand up at all by the very effect which is the established law here in the Tumey case and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2360.062" offset="9543659">The judicial review which is what they're talking about, they say judicial review will be inevitable and all of these men who were about to lose their jobs will run to Court whenever they feel that the -- that the system as setup isn't fair to them or easily don't get the right answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.775" offset="9614503">And to answer Mr. Justice Harlan, the -- I say this that the -- it isn't affect the case that these men will be running to Court every time they are being fired rather is a case, the system as it setup is such that they have no choice but to go Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.110" offset="9671764">But then again, how many competing unions will there be in the lifetime of these various organizations?</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.525" offset="9693497">Frankly, this UROC Organization got started about four or five years ago and has been having relatively rough time for the simple reason that men have been fired whenever the powers that be in the brotherhoods have found out that they belong to another organization and at the same time have dropped out, out of the BRT by not saying their dues unless the only situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.732" offset="9770297">And so therefore we feel as was said in the Edwards case which I -- which we have quoted on page 11 that in that case, judicial review was possible and therefore the judicial review is possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.267" offset="9812407">Not so much because of the -- to prove bias as it is actually because of various setup order system that we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.474" offset="9849292">Now finally, if the Court please, the situation comes down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.937" offset="9883146">The -- we have a question of not so much economics but broad union backgrounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.141" offset="9927973">As was indicated yesterday, I believe Mr. Kaiser said so these men are entrenched and it should be no -- no more new unions that come to the Act as far as Section 3, First (f) is concerned, contemplates the formation of new unions because it says “Any new union -- any union organized in the future.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.922" offset="9995055">We feel that whether or not the BRT or any other labor organization individual industry conforms to any particular system to recognize the rights of the minority, that's up to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.794" offset="10050539">But we feel, if the Court please, that whatever system there is, if there's to be a new union recognized of these men who are members of the BRT field, they are dissatisfied and they form not in one little localized area but throughout the country another organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.901" offset="10122951">And in this case, if Your Honors please, we have a basic point and that is an industry union on the railroad as against the craft union within the railroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="2821.255" offset="11388426">Now what actually happened in this case, if Your Honors please, it was not until May of 1955 -- May of 1955 that any approach was made to the qualifying unions saying, “We believe we are national in scope and are entitled to that status.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2858.984" offset="11539310">The obvious truth is that because of the purposes of Subsection (c) granting this exemption from the requirement to belong to a union shop gives to new unions in this field a latitude no where enjoyed throughout the country or throughout our trade union history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.760" offset="11638366">All a new union need do and it's only limited to the operating Brotherhood is to go through this easy three First (f) procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.174" offset="11684028">It may not even require an ultimate determination by a board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.446" offset="11701164">It can and has been achieved by a simple request of the qualified union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.733" offset="11722271">But all they have to do is be “national in scope” and they can come to employees under a Union Shop Agreement and say to those employees, “You need not even pay dues to the contracting union, pay it to us and your job is protected.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.088" offset="11799698">Now that's unheard of in Trade Union history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.700" offset="11814222">They enjoy, I repeat, a right to compete nowhere else existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.195" offset="11840136">Now finally if I may because I think this is so important, I should like to come to grips with some of the questions put to me yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.828" offset="11886634">We must bear in mind that Judge Hand made two important decisions that a potential of infinite mischief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.886" offset="11930937">One was that by the very structure of these system boards, there is a legally implied bias that renders inconclusive and in subject to review any decision that that board would make where the position of the union is in any way in conflict with one of those that the union represents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.743" offset="12034382">Now that was the point to which Mr. Clattenburg addressed his remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.905" offset="12050996">That would mean that many instances are no way related to Union Shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.105" offset="12067819">Paid claims, seniority, and whatnot would be resolved ultimately in the courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3201.630" offset="12909902">But I must if I may get to the next point which I think is critical here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.485" offset="12937279">I want to try to have you understand that under our position which is eminently fed to the employee, to the contracting union, to the carrier and to the ultimate, the outside union, the second part of his decision in no way relates to bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.158" offset="12999973">The second part of his decision makes sense in terms of his premise, his premise is -- his premise is that subsection (c) gave to the individual employee a right himself to prove the qualifications of the ultimate union after he has joined the ultimate union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.824" offset="13134660">Now what does that mean in terms of the individual employee?</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.485" offset="13149288">Are we to assign to Congress an intention to say to railroad employees, “Join this union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.489" offset="13177292">We let you do this.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.834" offset="13182725">What we -- it's an awful gamble if you're wrong subsequently and it makes no difference, if the Court please, whether that subsequent wrong is determined by a court, by a system board or by the 3 (f) board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.354" offset="13240822">That employee has the burden imposed upon him of taking a frightful gamble and then the further burden of proving facts or proving a concept that is quite nebulous with facts that he doesn't posses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.374" offset="13312920">The employee doesn't know the extent of organization, the number of contracts the union has, what his purposes are, what every might be subsumed within this elastic evasive concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.097" offset="13359731">It imposes on this employee an intolerable burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.728" offset="13374255">Moreover, it invites conflict between the carrier and the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.223" offset="13400273">The whole thrust of the Act is to stay away from all boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.666" offset="13418036">Let's negotiate our differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.411" offset="13429008">The Act says, “Sit down and work it out by conference.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.102" offset="13443741">Well, you can't work it out because nobody has determined as yet whether this union is “national in scope.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.707" offset="13478222">And we say that -- what Congress said and it's totally consistent with statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.805" offset="13502568">And let me -- very briefly to the juries' use of the definite article in subsection (c), it says as to operating employees, the requirement of union membership shall not impose somewhat apply to any employee who holds or acquires membership in any one of the labor organizations organized -- “national in scope” and organized, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.661" offset="13622000">Now the (Inaudible) is very clumsy if it doesn't mean anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.474" offset="13637256">It could have said in any labor organization organized “national in scope” and organized in accordance with the provision of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.558" offset="13665573">They said the -- they used a definite article to serve its grammatical function of identifying known phenomenon, unions that are already declared “national in scope.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.732" offset="13722311">And it makes no sense in any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.233" offset="13736312">And if this Court abstains from ruling on this critical point, either way, then the confusion that has been around us since 1951 will continue and I say it's unfair to the employee and unfair to the outside union and unfair to the carriers and unfair to the contracting unions, and hence -- and hence, unfair to the public who are the real beneficiaries of this statute.</text>
