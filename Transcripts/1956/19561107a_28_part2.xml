            <label>Mr. Donald B. Sommers</label>
            <text syncTime="5.990" offset="127352">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.069" offset="179597">In the connection with what I was taking up before recess, it is claimed in the reply brief by petitioner that they did produce sufficient evidence of negligence if you look to the whole of the case and not just to the component parts which were fitted in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.806" offset="286595">If the whole of the case, I submit to the Court includes the concurrent duties or the inexperience of petitioner, which is set up in the recent response of petitioner as grounds for recovery, then these are acts of negligence which caused otherwise safe methods and otherwise safe places of work to become unsafe if that be the fact and they should be pleaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.854" offset="422745">The whole of the case -- looking to the whole of the case certainly does not mean that the component parts can be ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.785" offset="450539">And I submit that evidence can only be fairly apprised or appraised by looking at it step by step.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.389" offset="488887">In addition, as exampled as to why the whole of the case should be looked to, petitioner says that even though the pleaded elements such as the culvert, the condition of the culvert and the hand torch method of firing it right away were not of themselves acts of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.262" offset="564433">Combined, they were on the theory of Mrs. O'Leary's account on page 21 of appellant's brief or petitioner's brief, wherein it says that the state court's faulty conclusions are due -- due to the fact that it detaches and separates, (1), the combined dangers involved, (2), the place of work and (3), the method of work from each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.333" offset="660668">By this process, it was able to say that torching in and of itself was not dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.019" offset="679476">The train was perfectly safe and the culvert was adequate for ordinary purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.694" offset="702151">The petitioner goes on to say these truisms take on a different meaning when we consider the manner in which they were being used.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.893" offset="734960">For illustration, a cow is a docile animal, and an oil iron is a simple appliance and barns are commonplace structures, but we learned through Mrs. O'Leary that they cannot be used successfully in close and dangerous proximity to each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.675" offset="794102">And I think that is the gist of the appeal of this case and I submit that what they are saying there that we, according to the evidence, use an ordinary and reasonably foreseeable method of setting fire to the weeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.063" offset="855646">We used an ordinary and reasonably safe method or place for this man to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.249" offset="880410">But since we added the petitioner himself, it became dangerous and that is what they are saying by that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.781" offset="906533">And we of course tied the torch to the tail of a cow which didn't know what it was doing by reasonably anticipate that he might get himself involved in the fire, but the railroad did not in this case set a fire and leave it abandoned so that passing trains or winds could cause it to sweep down upon unsuspecting employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.691" offset="1014157">That was not the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.775" offset="1022516">It delegated the duty of this petitioner to go out there and watch and attend the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.571" offset="1049684">He was the one, the only one, who was supposed to know how much fire he had at one time and know and what precise point along the right of way it was burning.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.080" offset="1087718">The fact that he chose to later do so -- later ignore the fire in order to watch for hotboxes, although he knew it was his primary duty to do otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.033" offset="1131499">While it may not be an act of negligence, it's not necessary for respondent to -- to contend he was negligent in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.552" offset="1165563">The point of it is the ignorance -- his ignorance of the fire does not constitute negligence on the part of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.949" offset="1203179">Now, as to the Missouri Court's opinion, it has been stated by the respondent that the Missouri Court ignored the dictates of this Court under cases -- in cases of -- of the Federal Employers Liability Act, and I submit that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.000" offset="1263365">There was no conflicting evidence which was argued to the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.257" offset="1288443">There was no conflicting evidence which the Court had their way as in Wilkerson versus McCarthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.688" offset="1310072">It did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.307" offset="1316551">It took only that evidence, most favorable to the petitioner and applied it to the pleadings and the issues raised by petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.458" offset="1365243">It did not ignore reasonable inferences of fact as in Lavender versus Kurn, Tennant versus Peoria and Schulz versus Pennsylvania Railroad Company, wherein in those cases, the deceased was unable to speak for himself and tell the exact details of the accident and the case necessarily had to be made from circumstantial evidence from where -- from -- from which juries could make reasonable inferences and -- and reasonable minds could differ it.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.725" offset="1482271">The Court did not have that proposition because the petitioner himself was in court and told everything that happened and gave his whole and complete version of what happened there.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.215" offset="1532217">And I submit that all of the Missouri Court did is agree with me that even on taking the evidence in the light most favorable to this petitioner, there is much to be said about the condition of the right of way even from his own words, whether or not that constituted a danger where there was a question raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.139" offset="1623960">There was much to be said for there was no evidence as to whether or not the culvert was safe or suitable for reasonably foreseeable circumstances as Brady versus Southern indicated by this Court as required.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.091" offset="1699715">And furthermore, the Court also said that in as much as the fire was not by the respondent left unwatched, unintended, it cannot be said that the use of the hand torch and that method of setting the fire enhanced the danger of the fire, because it was not left unwatched and unattended by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.665" offset="1798040">It was left unwatched and unattended by this 24-year-old man whom I assume has reasonable and ordinary intelligence, raised in the country down in Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.377" offset="1848926">And he alone knew that was his duty to watch the fire and did not charge anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.230" offset="1880273">Certainly, in this case, the petitioner was assigned a simple task and given a simple appliance, all that was expected of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.145" offset="1919979">And I -- by the way, I -- I don't mean to imply to this Court that had he watched this train for hotboxes as he did, as he says he did that he was to be in any way is criticized.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.530" offset="1969507">All we ask that he not get himself involved in the job in which he was then and there assigned to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.087" offset="2003675">And I submit to this Court that a reasonable and prudent employee could not anticipate the bizarre set of circumstances which resulted in the accident to this employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.909" offset="2059055">Certainly, on the pleaded issues, the petitioner cannot be heard now to raise this question of inexperience or on the plea of the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.515" offset="2101478">He cannot be heard to.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.406" offset="2109001">Now, for the first time say that an emergency situation was created because of conflicting and concurrent duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.501" offset="2141393">I respectfully submit that the unanimous decision of the Missouri Supreme Court ought to be affirmed by this Court as submitted.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark D. Eagleton</label>
            <text syncTime="521.686" offset="2190085">May it please your -- the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.384" offset="2208893">Of necessity in any pleading, I suppose in any state, you don't plead all of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.485" offset="2233344">If you did, you would have to come in with a transcript of evidence rather than a pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.699" offset="2250167">We usually come out with a longer one that we go in with.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.141" offset="2263960">What you plead is ultimate facts and the facts are simply set forth in our petition filed in the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.445" offset="2297187">We haven't changed a single fact, a single theory, a single position and don't intend to.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.590" offset="2321742">But Mr. Sommers, when Mr. Chief Justice Warren asked him to -- what this -- what did the pleading say, he started reading at the tail end of paragraph 5 instead at the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.455" offset="2373151">And I'm going to ask Your Honor's indulgence because I'm not going to use the full time anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.525" offset="2389452">I don't think that it's all necessary here.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.286" offset="2404498">He -- he overlooked the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.195" offset="2416201">Mr. Chief Justice said, “Do you make a distinction between being compelled to watch these cars for hotboxes are being required?”</text>
            <text syncTime="588.095" offset="2455803">He said, “No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="588.928" offset="2459042">But then, when he went to read the pleading, he overlooked the allegation about being required.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.444" offset="2481194">On page 2 of the record, the pleading says that the defendant was engaged in burning weeds using a hand torch along defendant's right of way near Garner.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.166" offset="2528005">In so doing, he was required, the petitioner was required to work at a place in close proximity to defendant's tracks whereon trains moved and passed causing the fire from said burning weeds and the smoke there from become dangerously close to the plaintiff and requiring plaintiff to move away from said danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.384" offset="2624867">That on the occasion herein mentioned a train did pass and did cause plaintiff to fast retreat and move quickly from the place where he was then working and he uses his place of work on the right of way adjoining a culvert covered with slope, loose and sloping gravel which did not provide adequate or sufficient footing.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.902" offset="2710967">All we've done is plead the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.428" offset="2725073">Mr. Justice Douglas in the Bailey case said, “That's all you plead.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.034" offset="2747538">That's all you submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.366" offset="2752867">That's for the jury to appraise and consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.343" offset="2764779">You can't plead it anymore succinctly or chronologically than that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="669.013" offset="2779408">That's exactly what he said happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.196" offset="2788185">“I was required to stare within close and dangerous proximity to those tracks at a time you were running a train on it and at a time when you had at least set a fire with this torch as you caused by your train and your wind the fire to envelop me, so I have to move quickly away or be burned to death.”</text>
            <text syncTime="692.169" offset="2872090">And he said, “That isn't enough.”</text>
            <text syncTime="694.079" offset="2879718">No jury could find the defendant was negligent under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.981" offset="2895287">He said that it defies the rule of foreseeability.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.749" offset="2910333">Where was the petitioner to go?</text>
            <text syncTime="704.449" offset="2921200">There's no mystery about this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.133" offset="2927888">He couldn't go south.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.363" offset="2932799">He'd go into the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.614" offset="2937814">He couldn't cross east.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.849" offset="2942725">He'll be crossing the tracks when they told him not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.440" offset="2953174">He couldn't go west.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.534" offset="2957458">That's where they were burning the weeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.513" offset="2965400">He could only go north.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.868" offset="2970833">That's the direction he did go, 30 or 35 yards north.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.648" offset="2985984">And then, what -- why did he stop there?</text>
            <text syncTime="722.472" offset="2993298">Because they had imposed on him his duty to watch these hotboxes, and he said that he was standing there voluntarily, these two seconds.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.059" offset="3023600">That's all he stood, two to three seconds.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.797" offset="3038542">He said he's standing there voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.720" offset="3046275">Well, is that voluntarily when you're standing there in expressed compliance with a command?</text>
            <text syncTime="743.300" offset="3076577">In the record, let's see how that record recites that matter and it won't -- it disposes of this thing so clearly that I think that it's worth reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.198" offset="3124120">Did you receive -- page 12, “Did you receive any instructions from Mr. Howdershell, your foreman as to what you should do at all times while a section man was referenced to trains go by?”</text>
            <text syncTime="767.040" offset="3171558">“Yes, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="768.281" offset="3176469">“As to what your duties were, as -- as to what duties you were to perform, what were you told by him?”</text>
            <text syncTime="775.072" offset="3203636">Answer - “He told us to put down everything we were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.595" offset="3225788">Get clear of what we were doing and stand and watch the trains go by for hotboxes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="787.596" offset="3253791">And continuing just a short, “And you always done that -- had you always done that during the time you worked there as section man?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.252" offset="4520417">“Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="795.301" offset="4520312">“Were you told by him anything with reference to standing on the opposite track, opposite track and doing it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="802.100" offset="4520208">He said at all times he wanted some men on the one side of the track and some on the other and this petitioner was the only one, the only one that was left to perform that duty on the west side.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.474" offset="4520103">There wasn't anybody else there.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.109" offset="4519999">The record shows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.930" offset="4519894">Now, at page 29, counsel was cross-examining about his statement made in direct examination and the petitioner repeated this question by Mr. Sommers.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.915" offset="4519790">“You say he said you should drop everything you are doing and watch for hotboxes?”</text>
            <text syncTime="839.011" offset="4519685">Answer - “Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.271" offset="4519581">He said when a train is passing to not be working, be watching the train.”</text>
            <text syncTime="847.771" offset="4519476">And then when he gets over to page 30, the next page, as you knew, Mr. Sommers is still cross-examining, “as you knew on that day it was your duty to watch that fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.317" offset="4519372">"Yes, sir."</text>
            <text syncTime="858.730" offset="4519267">We don't say that he -- whether supposed to watch the fire as best he could while he was still trying to watch the train if he could.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.907" offset="4519163">They were conflicting.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.354" offset="4519058">I'll read that question and answer again here.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.046" offset="4518954">“That you knew on that day it was your duty to watch that fire.”</text>
            <text syncTime="871.988" offset="4518849">Answer - “Yes, sir."</text>
            <text syncTime="873.478" offset="4518745">And that was the first duty regardless of the train.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.012" offset="4518640">And now, his answer, “He told us to watch the train when it came by.”</text>
            <text syncTime="885.262" offset="4518536">Those were his explicit instructions and Mr. Sommers is trying to say, “Why didn't you go some other direction?”</text>
            <text syncTime="892.390" offset="4518431">On page 28, he says, “Why didn't you get behind your fire so the wind would pull it away from you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="900.478" offset="4518327">And he answers, “I would have been standing in the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.144" offset="4518222">There was fire on the shoulder, all south of me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="910.537" offset="4518118">He couldn't get any place by watching.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.629" offset="4518013">He -- he went as far as he could to get away from the hazardous position they placed him in.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.922" offset="4517909">Now, on page 12 of the respondent's brief, he said this petitioner was getting along performing his work with ease until he saw fit to leave his fire and stand next to the culvert.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.096" offset="4517804">He didn't see fit to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.546" offset="4517700">He was told to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.611" offset="4517595">He wasn't voluntarily doing anything but following instructions, and no witness took the stand, Howdershell and no one else took the stand and said, “I did not give those instructions or I did not expect them to follow them in that manner.”</text>
            <text syncTime="954.077" offset="4517491">The only thing you talk about a change in position, the only thing that was changed was the defendant's position, respondent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.330" offset="4517386">In the answer in his -- in the lower court, he never once said the plaintiff was doing something he shouldn't be doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.419" offset="4517282">Standing some place he shouldn't be standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.078" offset="4517177">He simply said he failed to watch where he was going, either ahead or laterally.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.368" offset="4517073">He failed to maintain secure footing.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.517" offset="4516968">He walked backwards of course when he was in peril and he made a misstep.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.821" offset="4516864">He never once submitted to the jury the fact that he left his fire unattended or that he was wrong in leaving it unattended.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.403" offset="4516760">No jury would say that he was wrong in leaving the fire for two seconds to perform a task that was made imperative by the defendant, the respondent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.310" offset="4516655">And under those circumstances to say that you needed a crystal ball to say that this man was going to be injured or even burn to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.512" offset="4516551">There's no place for him to go except what he did do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.833" offset="4516446">And I don't think when you say that you're trying to have the case considered as a whole, all of the facts that were alleged that you have to come up with an argument that you ought to say, you were saying you're trying to tie -- tie an oil pin on Mrs. O'Leary's cow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.439" offset="4516342">What we're trying to show is that things in a pattern in relation to each other must all be considered, what he was doing, why he was looking at this train, why he kept his eyes away for two seconds or three seconds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.008" offset="4516237">And in answer to Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Sommers said -- Mr. Justice Harlan asked him I believe, “Was there anything in the evidence to show that this culvert was any different than any other culvert?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.880" offset="4516133">And Mr. Sommers said, “No, I don't think that's effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.918" offset="4516028">I've got just a few little excerpts,” and not that I think that the culvert itself was already part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.479" offset="4515924">The loose gravel was only part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.421" offset="4515819">This fellow was doomed to be burned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.142" offset="4515715">I'd say with or without the loose gravel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.553" offset="4515610">The only thing the loose gravel did was to make certain of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.289" offset="4515506">He was due to get hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.562" offset="4515401">He'd either get burned to death on it and when he fell with the loose gravel, his back was injured instead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.907" offset="4515297">Now, here's the parts about that matter on page 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.407" offset="4515192">At the bottom, “Are culverts a very frequent and necessarily and plentiful thing around railroads?</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.029" offset="4515088">You saw a lot of them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.058" offset="4514983">Answer - “Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.236" offset="4516342">“In section work?</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.067" offset="4523656">I will ask you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.459" offset="4529194">“What is the fact normally?</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.554" offset="4537553">Do they have a flat surface upon which to walk across a culvert?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.940" offset="4555107">Answer - “Yes, sir, they do.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.926" offset="4563048">“Did this one had one or was it one that was there buried and covered up.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.456" offset="4585200">Answer - “Apparently, it had one, but they had neglected it and the vibration from the train had shaken it down, and then there was an objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.667" offset="4618010">The answer wasn't scripted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.294" offset="4624593">Then I went on with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.422" offset="4629086">“I don't want you to assume anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.747" offset="4638386">When you stepped on that portion of it, what was the effect that it had on your feet on that portion of the culvert where normally it is flat?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.274" offset="4672449">Answer - “Nothing, but crushed rock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.061" offset="4683630">No flat surface.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.326" offset="4692720">It rolled out from under me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.640" offset="4701915">Now, in -- in continuing in that same --</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark D. Eagleton</label>
            <text syncTime="1155.457" offset="4725217">About the culvert again, “Is there a path normally provided across the culvert right contiguous with the path?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.180" offset="4756041">That's the path he was coming up to the culvert.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.946" offset="4827199">“Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.469" offset="4827094">“How wide is the path across the culvert, approximately the same width, two and a half or three feet wide?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.148" offset="4826990">“And did you see that path on the culvert so as you went north to get away from the fire?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.543" offset="4829497">“On the day, what was it covered with?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.736" offset="4838275">Answer - “Loose rock, crushed gravel.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.167" offset="4852067">“What were the instructions to the section gang with reference to permitting or allowing loose rocks to be on that path across the culvert?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.340" offset="4880697">Answer - “When there's loose rocks, anytime we take out a tire or anything and move the rocks from the incline, he would have us to clean it out and put them back where they were so the men would have a safe place to walk.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.889" offset="4942973">No denial of it by Howdershell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.725" offset="4954258">It's just something -- something that shouldn't have been there, but the real cause of this thing, the whole picture is making him work where they told him to stand on the west shoulder of the road and they -- they -- even the place where they told him to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.461" offset="5017266">It's here on page 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.969" offset="5035238">You were told to stand at all times on the west shoulder of the road.</text>

            <text syncTime="1240.205" offset="5064182">Well, I'll repeat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.027" offset="5067525">I read that to the Court before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.199" offset="5080168">Now, I think -- I think under the circumstances that the Court in practically convicting this petitioner's negligence as a matter of law and say that he solely was to blame and that the respondent who had told him what to do which he followed where to stand which he followed, when this train going 35 to 40 miles an hour and with a wind disturbance and then imperative that it was not to blame at all and that no jury could so apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.869" offset="5194898">I don't believe that's the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.527" offset="5201481">And one thing about the survey of this culvert, he didn't have any chance when he went up to look, running up to this culvert.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.075" offset="5231679">He didn't have any chance to look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.555" offset="5241605">Then, his time was taken right when he got there to look at this train.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.014" offset="5255398">It says, “How long was it that you were in that position before you felt the flame or the burning process?</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.704" offset="5286222">How many cars had gone by?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.196" offset="5292178">“Approximately, three or four.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.671" offset="5302105">“About how fast would you say the train was moving?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.214" offset="5312240">“I would say 35 to 40 miles an hour.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.528" offset="5325511">“Had you when you went up there made any survey of the situation that was not there or the culvert at that time?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.311" offset="5352573">“No sir, I didn't.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.283" offset="5356544">He wouldn't have any occasion, so he runs as fast as he could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.477" offset="5373262">He turns to watch the -- the things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.375" offset="5380890">The next thing in a second or two is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.736" offset="5390294">He makes an effort to escape by backing six or eight feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.944" offset="5403146">The loose gravel throws him and he's injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.604" offset="5445778">Mr. Buckley says I misread a word here and I don't want to do that in -- on page 33.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.288" offset="5468557">He said I used the word “see” instead of “use”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.504" offset="5477439">“Did you use that path on the culvert as you went north to get away from the fire?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.449" offset="5501158">Answer - “Yes, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.495" offset="5505337">That's the same one of the loose gravel.</text>
