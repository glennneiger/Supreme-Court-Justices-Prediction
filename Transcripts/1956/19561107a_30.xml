            <text syncTime="52.020" offset="311463">This appeal is from the final order of the New York Court of Appeals which denied the motion for reargument but granted the motion to amend the remittitur to show that constitutional questions had been presented and necessarily passed upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.065" offset="411669">Appellants challenged the constitutionality of Title D, Chapter 17 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York and the action taken by the City thereunder in taking two of appellants' properties in foreclosure in rem for the collection of delinquent real estate taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.755" offset="562343">In this case, appellants' two properties worth in the aggregate $52,000 were confiscated to collect $887 of water charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.424" offset="653040">The statute involved -- provides an in rem method of collecting delinquent real estate taxes.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="152.180" offset="712077">Any difference water taxes and real estate taxes?</text>

            <label>Mr. William P. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="155.818" offset="726601">Water charges are defined by statute as a tax lien and then the statute goes on to define that at all delinquent liens, tax liens shall be foreclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.332" offset="780727">However, at this point, I take occasion to point out a significant difference that water charges can be collected in persona as provided in code.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.871" offset="830882">Furthermore, water charges can also be collected in a very simple way of turning off the water which is also pointed out in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.541" offset="877484">Well, the statute provides for the usual posting of a list of delinquent parcels in the clerk's office and then notice by publication, that is the novice feature of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.172" offset="960031">That's the way the action is commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.465" offset="977272">Then from that date, the defendant taxpayers have seven weeks to redeem their property.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.788" offset="1026487">If they don't redeem, then the statute forecloses them forever from redemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.505" offset="1065357">It then provides that they'll have another 20 days to answer it.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.541" offset="1085524">If they neglect to answer through inadvertence, mistake, oversight or any of those reasons, the statute directs that an absolute -- an irrevocable deed issued to the City for those -- for each of the parcels, that accomplishes a confiscation, a barefaced simple confiscation of all and the entire value of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.592" offset="1245706">Now, in this case, the appellants have been paying their real estate taxes ever since they acquired these two pieces.One was a -- a piece of real estate in Brooklyn, the other in Queens.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.790" offset="1314565">One was acquired in 1934 and the other in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.458" offset="1333164">The record shows that during that entire period, the appellants paid all of their real property taxes, which were vastly in excess of the amount of the water charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.437" offset="1393142">Now, commencing in 1945, due to the unexplainable behavior of a trusted bookkeeper who managed the clerical details for the office, these -- these bills for water charges were not paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.736" offset="1466284">The appellant trustee didn't know about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.337" offset="1484675">He was being presented with the real estate taxes in vastly larger amount than the water charges and he paid all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.368" offset="1524799">But this clerk, this bookkeeper didn't give him the -- the water charges for some reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.081" offset="1547682">In any event, the water charges commencing with the year 1945, were not paid, and it is for these water charges that the foreclosure action was commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.523" offset="1597419">That keyed it off.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.375" offset="1608913">Now, the statute provides that this foreclosure shall be instituted against any parcels which are four years or more delinquent.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.652" offset="1669935">The action against the Queens property came first.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.895" offset="1686967">That was instituted in May of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.319" offset="1708596">In May of 1950, there were only $72.50 worth of water charges which were delinquent four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.308" offset="1760632">Those were the only charges for which this foreclosure action could have been instituted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2395.352" offset="9684825">They did it a little differently in a rather curious difference by providing that the purchaser if the tax fail would be sold the smallest possible, undivided fee interest, which he would take in payment for the amount of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.014" offset="9763401">So then, you'll see the purchase if the tax sale winds up as a cotenant in fee with the owner, but the owner still has his surplus represented in the remainder of the fee.</text>

            <text syncTime="2617.193" offset="10572152">Mullane case, which was the key to the decision in Covey versus the Town of Somers states that any pro forma notice, which is reasonably calculated to bring the action to the attention of the defendant will satisfy the minimum requirements of the due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.003" offset="10663372">Of course, in the Covey case, there is an incompetence, but we contend that that minimum requirement for notice is not satisfied in a case where the plaintiff, the party bringing the action in New York City in this case knew or should have known from the facts that the pro forma notice would be a mere gesture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.699" offset="10778206">They in fact did know that this notice would be a mere gesture or should have known and are chargeable with knowing that it was a gesture from the record in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.260" offset="10824391">Now, this is why after plaintiffs -- after appellants, Queens property had been taken, they continued to pay real estate taxes on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2730.547" offset="11025533">Why, I -- I don't see what -- what would be a good example.Furthermore, the appellants paid the much higher real estate taxes and left unpaid the water charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.051" offset="11087600">Now, the water charges were small in amount, but because they are the older ones, they would detain these ones.</text>

            <text syncTime="2944.636" offset="11881932">It was laws of 1956, Chapter 481.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.907" offset="11898964">Now, that amendment provided in substance that with respect to in rem foreclosures, which had been completed in the past, the taxpayer could come in within a period of 60 days after the passage of a statute and request the return of his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.116" offset="11967822">And the Board of Estimate in its discretion could grant that application, provided that he paid the back taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.301" offset="11992586">As to future in rem foreclosures, the period for doing that was four months, but it also expressly applied retroactively, provided, you came in within the 60-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.573" offset="12045667">Now, this taxpayer came in and requested that the property be reconveyed to him pursuant to the statute and we wrote him a letter and said, “We would reconvey it to whom, provided, that he paid” -- it was about $15,000 of taxes which accrued in the meantime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.972" offset="12119228">And he wrote back a letter which said, “We'll be glad to do this after the Supreme Court decides the case, but will you please hold it in abeyance while the appeal is pending.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.513" offset="12157471">Now, those letters are not part of the record, because I -- and I didn't want to print them as a appendices because strictly speaking, they are not part of the record and they couldn't be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.286" offset="12196551">They are circumstances which happened after the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.478" offset="12213269">However, I have made typewritten copies of those letters and with the Court's permission, I'd like to hand them up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.456" offset="12241168">The statute, of course, I've printed because the Court can take judicial notice of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3069.307" offset="12380557">No, it relates to one of the two properties involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.882" offset="12390902">The reason for that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.811" offset="12398634">The statute is expressly made applicable to any property which the City has not reconveyed since it acquired title.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.556" offset="12429563">Now, the larger of the two properties, the City still had when the statute was passed and by its expressed terms the statute applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.921" offset="12459029">The other property, the so-called 45th Avenue property which is the smaller of the two the City had sold some six or seven months after it -- it had acquired title.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.076" offset="12503646">And as to that, the statute does not apply and I can see that the appeals of our respect to that parcel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.113" offset="12527783">But as to the other parcel, I think that the appeal is moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.074" offset="12543666">Now, of course, in his reply brief, the -- Mr. Jones says he doesn't like the statute and its terms and so forth, but any question -- I mean, the -- the ameliorated statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.328" offset="12592671">But any questions relating to that are, of course, not before the Court on this appeal and would have to be, it seems to me, the subject of a separate proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.520" offset="12629452">Now, turning to the other parcel as to which clearly the appeal survives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.152" offset="12655992">What happened here in substance is that the appellant had a bookkeeper who was an embezzler and a thief and they say so, themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.070" offset="12699669">Incidentally, I don't know to this day, what the bookkeeper's name was or -- or what's happened to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.768" offset="12730493">We have accepted at their face value the statements contained by Mr. Nelson in his affidavit when he moved to set aside the in rem foreclosure with relation of his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.977" offset="12779290">And Mr. Nelson says on page 9 of the record in his affidavit, “On or about November 13th 1952, the bookkeeper's attempted suicide precipitated deponent's discovery that the bookkeeper had for a number of years been converting his employer's funds to his own use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.054" offset="12867584">And otherwise, acting, so as to injure deponent and his co-trustees and deprive them of their property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.517" offset="12893393">Now, of course, that lies at the crux of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.788" offset="12914500">I don't see how the question of notice can arise in this case, as it did for instance in the Mullane case or as it did in this Town of Somers case, which incidentally involved a very similar statute to the instant one, but it was the New York State statute or the instant one is applicable in New York City alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="3233.592" offset="13037693">The other is the statewide statute and I might explain to Your Honor, just what the difference is and why we -- why we felt that a New York City statute was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.337" offset="13080743">You see, those statutes provide that when you foreclose, you cannot exclude any property which is delinquent because what they were trying to guard against was any possible favoritism on the part of the collecting officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.931" offset="13139048">Now, the state statute provides that if a parcel has been delinquent for four or more years, the tax district may foreclose.And when the tax district proceeds against these parcels which are delinquent, it takes in every delinquent parcel within the tax district.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.142" offset="13215953">Now, of course, New York City with its five counties is all one-tax district and that just wouldn't have worked for the City.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.836" offset="13242702">We don't want to foreclose against everything all at once.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.218" offset="13256286">So, the New York statute which parallels the state one very closely provides in substance that instead of doing it by the whole tax district, you can do it by so-called wards or sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.695" offset="13310203">The city treasurer picks out a section which is a well-recognized geographical division of the tax map and then proceeds with the in rem foreclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.654" offset="13350013">Now, if he proceeds -- and again, they were trying to guard against any playing of favorites in its taking in some parcels and excluding others, if a parcel is delinquent within the definition of a statute, it may not be excluded except or -- for rather narrow exceptions which are not irrelevant by all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.824" offset="13434650">Briefly, if some question of title has been raised or if some question as to -- if some arrangement has already been made to pay the taxes on an installment plan and one of the minor exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.579" offset="13485641">Now, that means that when the City proceeds against a particular section, it must include within that Section every parcel which is four or more years delinquent as to taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.349" offset="13544782">The city treasurer has no discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.131" offset="13555858">He may not exclude it because it is small.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.097" offset="13567770">As a matter of fact, one of the reasons for the passage of the statute was if the City had an enormous number of tax liens and no practicable method of collecting them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.149" offset="13620015">You see, the old alternative method and the one which prevails before the in rem procedure was in essence, a method which was substantially in personam and was similar to a private mortgage foreclosure.</text>

            <text syncTime="5495.943" offset="22087137">That when the City resorted to this stringent method of collecting the taxes, there was available to it existing in as part of their tax law, the method under Title A which was the well-accepted method of selling a tax lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="5518.123" offset="22175848">And then, the purchaser of the tax lien forecloses the tax lien and the owner gets surplus.</text>

            <text syncTime="5537.242" offset="22252335">But they chose to use the -- the abrupt, the confiscatory method because the -- the record undoubtedly showed here that this taxpayer didn't know what was going on and that this was the -- a sure windfall that was brought in to the in rem proceeding which it turned out to be some $51,000 of windfall property.</text>
            <text syncTime="5566.370" offset="22368841">Also, there's the clearly expressed intent of the legislature contained in the Governor's Bill Jacket which says that the in rem method was intended to get back on the tax rules, heavily encumbered properties whose -- where the taxes had -- had practically doubled up the economic value.</text>
            <text syncTime="5591.617" offset="22469883">And that Title A, this is the corresponding title in the state statute, was intended to be applied to improve properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5608.494" offset="22537383">Now, I -- I submit that the -- that under the circumstances of this case that the action of the City violated the appellant's constitutional rights.</text>
