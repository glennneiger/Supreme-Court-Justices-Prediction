            <text syncTime="23.531" offset="197465">On January the 22nd, 1954, a fire occurred on the premises of the Dresden Woolen Mills, which is located in the village of Dresden, Muskingum County, State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.419" offset="257024">Almost immediately following this fire, the State Fire Marshal, pursuant to the Chapter 37 of the Revised Code of Ohio, commenced his investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.668" offset="310000">And under the powers of that investigation, subpoenaing to Columbus, the owners and proprietors of the Dresden Woolen Mills, Mr. Harry and Nathan Groban, who are the petitioners and the appellants in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.877" offset="378859">At the appearance in Columbus before the State Fire Marshal, the Fire Marshal read to the petitioners Revised Code Section 3737.13 which is cited in our appendix, declaring a hearing to be private.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.524" offset="453465">That our -- the counsels or myself and my father's advice, the appellants at that time requested to be with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.730" offset="498291">This was the denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.575" offset="505710">Therefore, the petitioners-appellants refused to be sworn and refused to be testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.504" offset="529429">And at that time, under the powers granted to the Fire Marshal, the Fire Marshal committed them although technically, they were committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.460" offset="573210">We immediately filed our writ of habeas corpus in the common pleas court on March the 1st, the same day of the hearing and proceeded in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.462" offset="613230">These are the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.321" offset="616678">They're outlined in our brief, the appellant's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.324" offset="632665">I would like to add to that or supplement those facts with additional facts in view of the appellees' answer brief thereto with a copy of which my father and I received last week and did not receive a printed copy until yesterday morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.086" offset="711764">In the answer brief, they point out that that there was no actual incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.415" offset="733080">That was at page 1 of the appellees' brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.536" offset="745514">They spoke of an open hearing on the right of counsel at page 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.687" offset="766098">They speak of abrogated power of an investigator on page 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.232" offset="788250">These facts I feel will explain some of these various points that are mentioned in the appellees' brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.852" offset="838823">At the time -- at the first instance of the investigation by the Fire Marshal, the assistant Fire Marshal, Willis S. Peterson was accompanied by a Mr. Donahue who was a representative of the National Underwriters -- Adjusters rather which, in short, the appellant's building.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.249" offset="928371">It was stated to the appellants at that instance that the amount of fire loss claim would be a factor in determining one of the crime of arson, has been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.740" offset="982288">On that particular day, they appeared -- Mr. Peterson appeared with a tape recorder and accompanied by Mr. Donahue.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.607" offset="1009768">He advised the appellants that they were to commence to testify and it were to be taken down on this recorder.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.444" offset="1045191">At that instance, they phoned our office.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.427" offset="1057102">My father who had represented the company for a number of years was out of the city and could not be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.816" offset="1078627">I myself took the phone call, and at that instance, was advised by Mr. Peterson of the specific, Section 3737.13, where he claimed he had the power to exclude counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.089" offset="1131708">After briefly talking to him, I said that I would have to educate myself a little farther in the matter and I would like to call him back within a half an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.437" offset="1177161">I did that and at that instance, I advised him that although I had read the Attorney General's opinion that is cited by Judge Clifford in the common pleas court and is to a transcript to this record and referred to and relied to in that opinion, I could not bring myself to believe that it was not a constitutional deprivation of due process to exclude counsel in a hearing of this nature when he had been given so many other powers by our legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.589" offset="1309759">At that instance, the Fire Marshal, assistant Fire Marshal became incensed and advised me by -- on the phone that he was going to have a hearing in Columbus, subpoenaing these men, where this -- subpoena a different station, bringing all of their records of all the company to Columbus, and at that time, they'd had no right of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.339" offset="1404740">I say this for the very minute I might have, although, all of these facts are not in the actual record.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.168" offset="1432012">It must be assumed and can be supposed in this instance that such are the facts in this record because with a layman with this power, I submit that such could be the case at any instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.031" offset="1487496">If a man has this power with no limitations, personalities can become involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="361.008" offset="1547368">It becomes secret, but I think there is a very distinct difference between a grand jury who does not -- is not paid, it is not their duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.616" offset="1581850">They are his peers or his equals, 15 in number.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.942" offset="1599091">There is safety in numbers for personalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.286" offset="1608495">They are not there to -- to see that the person is with one particular goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.419" offset="1629080">They are individuals that have no -- are not paid by the State for an accomplished purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.554" offset="1653635">I think that is the -- the distinction and the secrecy there that -- that they are enclosed is because the public in general I think when they are called upon to pass upon their fellowmen are not required to have knowledge as to -- to be notarized as having put the accusation or point a finger to one of their fellowmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.450" offset="1745168">I think the underlying theory of the grand jury is entirely different than it is to an investigator in a crime of appellant.</text>

            <text syncTime="425.991" offset="1807339">If -- if the grand jury indicts then it goes through under the -- they commenced the proceedings to the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.920" offset="1839104">The actual step here is one step removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.648" offset="1853942">Actually, I assumed that in the instance that the Fire Marshal in this case, if he had enough evidence, although he can arrest and has the power of arrest in the 3737.10 of the Revised Code, they would still have to indict him to the grand jury in the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.844" offset="1930742">Nevertheless, I feel that the harm is done in so many of an -- an investigation where the man has the power of subpoenaing.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.994" offset="1963342">And then on top of that, has the power to arrest in a closed hearing where the -- the records, the -- the law does not prescribe that every word is transcribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.577" offset="2009631">It says that the testimony shall be required or submitted or reduced to writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.208" offset="2036172">Well, that's a little bit different, I believe than a -- ordering that the hearing must have a court reporter or somebody that transcribes the whole hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.682" offset="2074102">I -- I feel that in this particular instance and I think it will also must be a supposition that if personalities become involved, I would venture to say that there would be a record that would not be often a true record.</text>

            <text syncTime="508.926" offset="2139094">There was an order of committal whether he had actually spent the time in jail or not, is ordered and committed by the Marshal without any intervention of any judicial authority whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="555.852" offset="2326758">You see, I feel before the Murchison and Oliver cases will become directly in point in controlling on all force.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.533" offset="2357478">We would have had the petitioners in this instance sworn and then as becoming recalcitrant or being obstinate, have been found in contempt by the Court and summarily committed, and then we would have raised that enough where you had -- then question those particular statutes before this Supreme Court of Ohio, I think then those particular sections would be directly before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.808" offset="2462595">My -- my contention is held throughout this brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.380" offset="2480880">Is it -- you cannot disregard the In re Murchison and In re Oliver findings, but they are enlightening in showing the power that has been granted by the Ohio legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.556" offset="2525602">And -- and I believe in the In re Murchison case, this Court stated that a state court can delegate their administrative and investigatory duties to a member of the judiciary when they spoke of the one-man grand jury, but this is not a member of the judiciary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2171.431" offset="8789138">I think I should first attempt to clarify certain matters which arose during the questioning of my opposing counsel by members of the Court.On the question of what happened in this case, we had first what gave at least some appearance of being an incendiary fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.789" offset="8906480">Under the statutes of the State of Ohio, the State Fire Marshal is granted the power and given the duty to investigate the cause and origin of the fire to see whether or not it is of an incendiary nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.817" offset="8978683">He is given the power to summon witnesses and to hold this hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.102" offset="9003760">And at that point, if he finds there is evidence of a crime, primarily the crime of arson, he is then charged with the duty of turning over that evidence to the prosecuting attorney for presentment at that stage to the grand jury and possible indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.746" offset="9090382">I think I should also clarify one thing here and that is that the prosecuting attorney of Franklin County appears as counsel in this case not because any evidence of a crime was turned over to us, but in the nature of our civil function as legal adviser too and counsel for the various county officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.862" offset="9182856">And in this instance, the writ of habeas corpus was directed against the Sheriff of Franklin County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.742" offset="9210337">There has not been a charge of arson placed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.450" offset="9229145">The petitioners here were never defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.584" offset="9249729">In fact, when the summons was issued -- and these witnesses, and they are only witnesses, that distinction must be kept in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.093" offset="9295705">When these witnesses appeared and refused to be sworn or testify without the presence of their counsel, this habeas corpus was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.778" offset="9350457">And this habeas corpus became a vehicle to test the right of the State Fire Marshal to exclude counsel from this hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2346.386" offset="9488906">I was about to state that in this case, the men were never actually even delivered to the physical custody of the Sheriff of Franklin County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.461" offset="9529240">They were accompanied when the Fire Marshal conducted them to the county building for a commitment through the county jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.166" offset="9564035">They were accompanied by their counsel and their counsel secured the common please judge, one of the judges, to sign an entry affixing bail in this case in the amount of $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.782" offset="9642506">And at the time these witnesses were conveyed to the office of the Sheriff to be turned over or turned into his custody, the entry -- the court entry fixing bail was presented to the Sheriff simultaneously and the men were released on bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.570" offset="9721605">I -- in direct answer to Your Honors question, the fact that these men have been free at all times since the date of this hearing and that this action was brought as a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.481" offset="9797256">If the man had been committed, then the writ of habeas corpus would of course be a proper vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.142" offset="9839992">On the other hand, the bond was fixed here pursuant to the writ and that was the question that has always been the question in some judges' minds as to the effect of the fixing of bond upon the further proceedings on a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
