            <text syncTime="1105.229" offset="4420859">I think yesterday Mr. Justice Frankfurter asked a question to counsel as to the justification for this type of an ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.126" offset="4460460">Being interested in this case knowing it's coming up before this Court, I noted a news article appearing August the 8th in the Los Angeles Times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.756" offset="4499017">It was significant to me in that it showed a young girl, a secretary, 22 years of age, walking down the street when a man grabbed her, stuck a knife in her back, dragged her to the rear of a house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.468" offset="4549799">He assaulted her, she screamed, and he left.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.266" offset="4569025">This young lady was taken to the police department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.400" offset="4581564">She was able to identify the victim by police photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.596" offset="4598282">It appears that this man had registered in 1948 as an ex-convict having been sentenced in the State of Indiana for criminal attack upon a 25-year old woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.210" offset="4652826">Therefore, a period of nine years, there was no criminal activity yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.195" offset="4680725">And on occasion of -- of this sort, he was apprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.522" offset="4702041">He was identified because of the mode, the method that was used in the prior case to the most recent one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.052" offset="4736104">So I think that that is one example where a justification is present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.609" offset="4758361">I think it's also interesting to note that on October the 8th of this year, a news article appears stating that in the United State District Court, Southern District of California, the matter of the case of United States of America versus Hermeghan, Perez, Garcia and Garcia, numbers 26-641, San Diego Criminal Records.</text>

            <text syncTime="3791.097" offset="15164291">For the first two days, Judge Waters and I argued constitutional law and I don't think that we should have gotten angry at the appellant because of that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.832" offset="15191249">It was due mainly to the fact that Judge Waters had to take the case that I cited and obvious after two, justified the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.551" offset="15218103">It took two days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.647" offset="15222491">We submitted the facts in about five minutes except for what to me is the most important fact of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.638" offset="15246524">We never admitted mens rea and contracts of provision taken here by appellee, my feeling is that the true law in this type of situation as stated by this Court in the United States against Kahriger, 345 U.S.22.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.144" offset="15308487">In this case, a person who knew of the law and yet, he said, “I will not register or -- or as a gambler,” whatever it was, “until I test the constitutionality of this thing”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.104" offset="15348402">And this Court held that as long as he was in good faith knowing the law, not registering but the test of constitutionality that he was not guilty of -- of criminal intent, then I submit that -- that appellant here has to have no less benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.402" offset="15405558">The -- here's -- certainly a person who know the law, the liberty of violation or to make a test case which, I think, is -- is probable seizure as long as he in good faith as he was in this case, that -- when you don't even know the existence but -- but if you did know what would -- would either register or perhaps to make a test case, it'll be readily wrongly had been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.146" offset="15472536">But certainly, the rule of Kahriger is to the effect that we -- there must be a criminal intent in this sort of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.815" offset="15503256">Now, this is not all like the typical regulatory statutes which had been mentioned by a police, regulatory implies the regulation of a specific conduct, say to selling something, food or drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.868" offset="15555396">Say the driving of car, a person may have ability to have a car inspected, a duty to check his lights, a duty to have his food and -- and drug checked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.939" offset="15587683">But here, a person is simply living in a community, as -- as they imply, amicus curiae for appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.222" offset="15616836">A -- a perfectly passive status with no action at all, with -- this -- they are required to know some way that because they are just living in the community, must check a law and see whether now they have to register an ex-con as an ex-con.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.383" offset="15669499">It is particularly unfair since the laws are all for a reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3920.724" offset="15682873">The law says 33 and there are number of jurisdiction and above all, there are only five States, California being one in the whole United States, only five which our States have enacted such a law of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.420" offset="15729580">Those had been limited to -- to either -- to narcotic offenders or the sex offenders in every instance, those five States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3939.155" offset="15756539">There have never been the general catchall felonies as you wish to apply to state laws which apply the registration are limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.814" offset="15783184">And I submit that that limitation in itself made a competent constitution reasonableness although I have my doubt of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.752" offset="15814949">But certainly, it comes closer to being reasonable than does our present ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3958.301" offset="15833130">Now -- and -- and one other point which particularly in California are Section 290 of the Penal Code specifically requires that notice be given before the person is required to register by the Court itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.638" offset="15882449">And they are required to sign in writing, “We have been informed of our duty to register.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.678" offset="15898645">And that has made a part of the record of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.682" offset="15906691">And I submit that this kind of a law had to be dealt at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.624" offset="15918393">It must first be limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3981.161" offset="15924558">And above all, some form of notice must be given before a person to be held a criminal for not registering, particularly as applies to incoming migrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3989.404" offset="15957577">And I submit that the only way that they can be properly approached is to require the police not as in their discretion but as matter of the law, built in to the law, that before you register and before you can pick the thencoming people, you must give them first a chance to register and explain the law to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.894" offset="16015569">.And this is under Section 290, the Court itself or the probation officer or -- or someone and also the State must, not in distress, and as a matter of law, tell these people, “You are required to register, sign here that you've been told for.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.669" offset="16066664">We have nothing anywhere near that application of reasonableness in -- in our department.</text>

            <text syncTime="4091.058" offset="16364147">You see, rather to leave the burden upon the millions of migrants we have in California or in other cities, City of Los Angeles, placing the burden upon them, we could put upon the State the burden so easily, so conveniently, so firm of -- of informing them, “We want to register,” if indeed our policy is not to make criminals out of America is what we do part too much of.</text>
            <text syncTime="4112.720" offset="16450873">But -- but we -- we're trying to enforce a law that the idea is to get them to register, not put him in jail for not registering, and it's a very simple thing just to tell them either to the Court or to the arresting officers, “We want you to register if you want to live in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.961" offset="16507820">No, you didn't know this because you do here,” and because -- because even lawyers do not know the law, as I did when this thing first of rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="4227.810" offset="16911151">Our whole factual of defense was intent, no intent, no mens rea, no notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4233.399" offset="16933512">Perhaps, the officer given her notice as was suggested here, we don't know whether he did or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4237.439" offset="16949708">They could have, under cross-examination, shown that in fact, she didn't have notice because we told her to register or go to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="4242.906" offset="16971546">I mean that was never been upon the motion for a new trial or motion for arrest of judgment, that was then a proof of the witness that goes through to stand for.</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.070" offset="17000176">We concede it that she hadn't registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4251.924" offset="17007595">We wanted to show that she did not know she had to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="4254.499" offset="17017940">And at that point, surely, they could have brought in the cross-examination the officer told her to register or go to jail which was not -- obviously not the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4260.957" offset="17043749">So it nearly screwed what (Inaudible) back to defense but we got from a demurrer raised constitutional objection with the hope of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.593" offset="17090351">Now, the fact as -- as contended by the -- by the Attorney General here that uncooperative people are people at high rate crime rate areas are the ones who get registered or get convicted under this law, shows that the great discretion and leeway letting the police officer to decide who -- who to prosecute and -- and this would have a particular heavy insight from the minority group because they tend to live at high crime rate areas and are subject more throughout the rest and here, it often aren't cooperative because they do resent that thing and here people who aren't cooperative live in high crime rate areas are just singled out admittedly by the police for prosecution whereas other people are not prosecuted but are given the chance to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.935" offset="17251683">I think we should not them let the people to discriminate the matter of law, the matter of constitutional right that people must first be informed if we do want them to be registered rather that to be made criminals again when they try to straighten up and be decent American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4330.429" offset="17321691">As for the congressional law I mentioned I do not know what it would be faced whether they were brought here and couldn't relevant here, to me, of course, to come under attack.</text>

            <text syncTime="4341.131" offset="17364428">And I also I submit that it would require notice, would require criminal intent of law which was passed by Congress in 1956 requiring a limited group of narcotic vendors to register.</text>

            <text syncTime="4574.586" offset="18298253">From your brief, I gather, you've argued quite a different point with reference to notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4579.870" offset="18319464">Is that what you put in here?</text>
            <text syncTime="4582.922" offset="18331585">You offered to prove, as I understand, that this law which required registration of conviction of a felony was a law that was not clear and what a felony was.</text>
            <text syncTime="4600.245" offset="18400967">The definition of a felony in California was one that was so vague and ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="4606.950" offset="18427716">It frequently would require proof of some kind and study an investigation to determine whether a person's act was a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4616.745" offset="18466900">You offered to prove, as I recall it, during the trial that she did not know whether the offense which she committed was a felony or not a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4629.869" offset="18519458">You were raising a point there not that -- not saying that you were challenging the idea that a person was presumed to know the law, I mean, in that favor, but that they couldn't be presumed to know so as to fasten criminal guilt on the meaning of a felony when it was obscure as it was in California.</text>

            <text syncTime="4716.142" offset="18864483">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice Warren.</text>
            <text syncTime="4721.699" offset="18886740">By way of summary then, we first thought to show here that the effect of this ordinance is to invade the constitutionally protected right of convicted persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4732.554" offset="18930207">The first one we mentioned was the right to privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4735.209" offset="18940761">Mr. Linn made that point very well for me when he told the story of the young sex offender in California who found it impossible to get a job now because of the existence of his registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4748.110" offset="18992379">Another constitutionally protected right, which we feel is invaded by this ordinance, is the right to liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4754.062" offset="19016202">And finally, we've talked about the right of free transit among the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.912" offset="19031562">The privilege and immunity and move freely among the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4762.022" offset="19048072">I might bring this point closer to home by asking you to imagine that there was an ordinance in Alexandria, one in Arlington and one in Falls Church as there are in many Southern California communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4773.975" offset="19095824">Now, this ordinance has contained a provision that if you go into a particular area five times in a month, you have to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="4780.581" offset="19122260">So a person living in any one of the Virginia communities would certainly have to register in every other one because his normal professional and social life would certainly take him into the other community.</text>
            <text syncTime="4791.576" offset="19166250">In Los Angeles, the only way a person can be safe with the freeway system being what it is and the constant transit from one part of the city to another is to register in all of the communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.302" offset="19213166">The second point we've attempted to make is to say that if this ordinance is permissible at all, it cannot be sustained here because it is not reasonably restricted to the evil with which he purports to deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4817.590" offset="19270322">That's Mr. Whittaker's point exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4820.750" offset="19282965">I'd like to expand that to say it's not only as it limited -- not limited in terms of the offenses that are included but as our brief indicates, it's not limited in terms of time elapses since conviction and it is not limited in terms of first -- first offenders and probationers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4840.505" offset="19361959">I would again point out that the statistics that Mr. Linn hasadduced here today with respect to the prison population and the number of convictions that they have had are not quite in point with respect to first offenders and probationers as I said yesterday about all those statistics prove as the judges don't very often send people to prison unless they have prior records.</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.034" offset="19456104">I'm sure it's common knowledge to all of us that most first offenders are put on probation and never reach that prison population.</text>
            <text syncTime="4871.717" offset="19486824">There are a great, great many people in the United States who commit one crime in their life and thereafter lead law-abiding lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="4879.716" offset="19518798">And finally our third point, and this is on somewhat different level, we contend that when a morally innocent and passive status has been made a crime, conviction of that crime requires proof of wrongful intent, requires that is a showing defendant knew or should have known of her duty to register and ignored it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4897.270" offset="19589016">Now, at this point, I'd like to deal with the question that Mr. Justice Whittaker raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.066" offset="19612212">He asked how you would go about proving this matter at trial that the defendant always get off by saying that she or he did not happen to know of the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4912.391" offset="19649515">If the answer to that is that this would be as any other fact in the course of the trial, if the defendant claimed that she did not know of her duty to register, the prosecution could controvert that and put on evidence that that was just inherently unbelievable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.782" offset="19707089">If the Los Angeles police had publicized this ordinance in the way that I think they ought to by radio announcements and in the newspapers, they might very well be able to convince the jury that she was not telling the truth when she said that she didn't know about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4940.486" offset="19761842">So it seems to me that that would be an issue in the litigation just as other issues as to her guilt and innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4946.203" offset="19784725">And I see no insuperable problem in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="4951.111" offset="19804369">I would mention in that connection that I feel that Mr. Grey has almost conceded this point by his statement that it's the policy of the police to permit a person to register if he's picked up and doesn' know of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4963.989" offset="19855882">That's exactly what I'm contending for.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.815" offset="19863197">I would just like to have that made more definite than in the discretion of the police, the statement in -- from the police that they used this ordinance only with respect to people who are uncooperative or who live in high crime areas, I think it has in it a seed of a very dangerous harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4984.027" offset="19936026">High crime areas has an unfortunate connotation, meaning areas of our city where the minority groups congregate and live and uncooperative knows there's something that can be determined by a particular police officer in terms of his like or dislike of the person who was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5002.091" offset="20008333">And thus we are contending that a person should not be convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment simply because she existed for a period of time within the geographical limits of the city and at some time in the past had been convicted of a crime punishable with felony in California.</text>
