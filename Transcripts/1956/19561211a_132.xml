            <label>Mr. Joseph P. Jenkins</label>
            <text syncTime="21.888" offset="190882">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.407" offset="201017">This is a criminal case on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit which had overruled an order entered by the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, whether affirmed in which he had overruled an order for a motion filed by the defendant asking the court to placate or correct an illegal sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.934" offset="315120">It involves interpretation of that part of a Bank Robbery Act which I believe because of the contentions of the Government and because of the Fifth Circuit Courts of Appeal relative to the entry with intent provision has placed that particular provision in a rather unique position insofar as the (Inaudible) of our jurisprudence is concerned with criminal matters because this Court is being asked to construe the bank robbery statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.501" offset="425357">First, to define the purpose of the 1937 Amendment to the statute, secondly, to determine what is a maximum sentence imposable under subsections (a), (b) and (d) of the statute which are the traditional or classic form of bank robbery, if I may the use the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.540" offset="501530">And thirdly, if a person is accused of entering a bank with intent to commit a robbery or felony therein or larceny and counsel makes the act particularly under aggravated circumstances as involved in this case, whether or not the entry with intent act, which is peaceful in this case, merges with the aggravated robbery provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.738" offset="606333">The sole contention of the petitioner here is that count two of the indictment here it involved is legal and that no crime was committed thereon.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.662" offset="642069">And if a crime was committed, it was merged in the first count of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.605" offset="665788">The statute involved is Title 18, Section 2113, the Federal Bank Robbery Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.750" offset="690343">This Act was enacted in 1948 as a reenactment of the original bank robbery statute, Title 12, Section 588 (b) amended in 1937 and repealed at the time the reenactment was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.229" offset="752306">Subsection (a) of the Act prohibits two crimes, robbery by force and violence and intimidation and entry of a bank with intent to commit a felony therein affecting such bank and larceny and a 20-year penalty is assessable.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.619" offset="813850">Subsection (b) prohibits grand and petit larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.590" offset="825762">Subsection (d) which is a rather unique statute prohibits any of these acts to be committed by the use of a dangerous weapon or device by assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.154" offset="864005">And if so, a penalty of 25 years is assessable.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.028" offset="879470">This is known as the jeopardy or aggravated portion of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="217.184" offset="972152">Count number one was commission of the act of bank robbery under aggravated circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.764" offset="990438">Count number two was entry of the bank to commit the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.045" offset="1007574">Trial was held and the evidence show that he had entered the bank at Malone, Texas during daylight hours, during regular business hours through a duly designated entrance without any force or violence as other people had done familiar to customer while where he was invited.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.014" offset="1083434">While there, he asked certain directions of a bank officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.984" offset="1099316">He was given directions.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.398" offset="1104959">He then displayed the weapon and consummated the act of bank robbery which is prohibited by subsection (d) of the Act under aggravated circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.182" offset="1148113">He was sentenced after being found guilty for 20 years on entering the bank or the robbery forcing thereof and 15 years on the second count which is the entry with intent, these sentences to run consecutively or for a total of 35 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="347.148" offset="1491989">A motion to enlarge is in the record and that was -- it was granted by the court and the last four pages of the record pertain to how the bank was entered which is important we believe in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.821" offset="1534621">And as referred to by both the Government's brief and the petitioner's brief at the supplemental record, it's actually pages 17 to 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.673" offset="1566072">Now, in 1955, a motion to correct or modify in legal sentence was filed under Rule 35 with Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.822" offset="1598673">It was overruled by the trial court, Judge Ben Rice presiding.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.066" offset="1615600">It was appealed to the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.449" offset="1625213">Your Honor, it was affirmed and certiorari was granted by this Court last June.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.610" offset="1645798">The contentions of the petitioner are two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.412" offset="1656978">First, that when Congress enacted the 1937 Amendment to the Bank Robbery Act, they did not intend to cover anything but burglary and larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.500" offset="1693341">Burglary being in a tradition or classic form or in the form under the modern statutes and it was not intended to cover mere peaceable entry of a bank walking in the front doors in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.723" offset="1738271">And secondly, that if this Court feels that this particular type of crime or entry is within the purview of the 1937 Amendment in any event when the culminated act, when the intended act is completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.284" offset="1796472">Congress isn't interested in sensing for both but merges into the completed act particularly when the 25 years sentence is imposed under subsection (a) of the Act, that being we submit to this Court, the maximum penalty accessible under the Bank Robbery Act, Sections, (a), (b) and (d), leaving out kidnapping and murder which are covered in other subsections.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.146" offset="1883930">But the traditional, the classic form of bank robbery is covered in (a), (b) and (d) of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.987" offset="1919352">Now, the point A, my first point refers to what did the 1937 Amendment to the Act cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.997" offset="1963342">Now, the Government in its brief rather oddly, I believe, submits that this Court doesn't have to go behind the statute but can just read the words and that words themselves will show what the intent of the Congress was.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.307" offset="2012557">I heard just in this Court yesterday that we cannot apply artificial, mechanistic reasoning to interpreting words of a statute like the hieroglyphics of shorthand.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.189" offset="2048084">We must go behind the statute to determine what is the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.295" offset="2068564">This -- the history of this Act is very revealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.281" offset="2080475">The 1934 Act only included robbery by force and violence and then if it was committed under aggravated circumstances, a -- an additional sentence was then imposable.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.930" offset="2135124">They had requested the Attorney General that this Act include larceny and burglary, but for some reason, the Congress did not deem that.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.437" offset="2169083">It should be so and did not enact that procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.140" offset="2187891">Now, in 1937, this was found to be a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.232" offset="2200325">This Act was not all-inclusive and something else should be added to the Act and this was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.893" offset="2230941">The Attorney General directed a letter to the Speaker of the House and he said that he wanted this Act amended to include burglary and larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.695" offset="2270124">And he submitted a -- a draft of proposed legislation in which he uses the words entry with intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.883" offset="2302934">Now, the House Judiciary Committee and the Senate Committee reported favorably on the bill, both of their reports referred to the bill as an act to amend the Bank Robbery Act to include burglary and larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.669" offset="2362075">There were some debates on the floor between Representative Rankin and Wolcott and both of them referred to the Act as burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.953" offset="2395199">They used the word breaking and entering no less than five times when -- when the Act was read to the -- to the House, to the Floor, the clerk used the words, enact to amend the bank robbery statute to include burglary and larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.825" offset="2458624">The request of the Attorney General was heeded and the Act was enacted, but nowhere in any of the history, debates, letters, reports was there anything said, this Act should include burglary under the circumstances here if that is at all burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.870" offset="2530826">Now, was there any intention to increase the penalties under the Ac, now, was there any intention to redefine burglary far beyond any concept that I know in the state courts or any concept known in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.987" offset="2591326">Now, for some reason, the courts, some of the courts below, there are just a few of them that have interpreted the statute, have felt that peaceful entry is burglary and that this particular part of the statute means that peaceful entry is prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.063" offset="2667604">If the necessary animus is present, even though a person may abandon his intent, he is still committed the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.725" offset="2702294">He is a felon, even though the act itself has no -- no intention whatsoever of that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.342" offset="2728730">Now, burglary, we all know is a very serious crime, particularly the old classic form of burglary in the nighttime with -- of dwelling house with occupants.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.770" offset="2770422">But our modern versions have redefined burglary, so that now, today, burglary may be entrance without force of a place in the daytime.</text>

            <text syncTime="1232.885" offset="5034924">Now, if Your Honor please, the courts below have held over and over again the that (a) and (d) are only one crime, is a massive citations in the -- both briefs that (a) and (d) cannot stand together, but these all have referred to the robbery, prohibited in (a) and then (d), the same robbery under aggravated circumstance and the courts have held unanimously one crime with the 25 years sentence including this Court whether obliquely perhaps in Holiday v. Johnston, when it was sent back to lower court to change the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.085" offset="5179747">The courts have -- maximum to being 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.500" offset="5193331">Now, the courts have even held that when seven or eight persons are in -- put in jeopardy that only one count will stand because the maximum again is 25 years under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.170" offset="5260100">However, the -- the particular question involved here when entry not under aggravated circumstances is charged and then, the bank robbery, under aggravated circumstances, those are (a) and (d) crimes, the Fifth, Sixth and Ninth Circuit have met the problem head on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.392" offset="5324988">Only the Fifth of all the courts has held that an -- an aggravated entry will stand with aggravated robbery so that a person may be sentenced to a maximum of 45 years, while the Sixth Circuit has said, no, there is a merger into the -- into (d), a maximum of 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.415" offset="5408998">And the Ninth Circuit has held that similarly, except in dictum because they sent the case back to the -- to the trial judges, there were two of them, and simply said that they had no jurisdiction, hard case of the quicksand of law, you should apply for executive clemency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.896" offset="5482977">Clearly holding that there is a merger of (a) and (a) crime has committed into (d), particularly entry with intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.467" offset="5513279">But the Fifth Circuit has held if the entry with intent is not committed under aggravated circumstances, then it will not merge into (d) which simply means that if you commit the entry with -- with aggravated circumstance and walk in and threaten a guard when you walk in and then commit the robbery under aggravated circumstances, they will both merge into subsection (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.372" offset="5608887">But if you don't commit the entry under aggravated circumstances, they won't merge, which means a more serious penalty for the lesser crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.797" offset="5638562">And if this is hard to believe, on page 17, or rather in the brief in pages 37, the Court has quoted and this only shows the confusion may arise if we interpret this as separate crimes is inconceivable that a person who enters a bank under unaggravated circumstances can be sentenced to a heavier sentence than one who does enter the bank under aggravated circumstances and then commits the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.447" offset="5749112">The court truly held below that that could be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.457" offset="5761233">Now, the Fifth Circuit has also held just last year that there is a merger, holding my point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.714" offset="5790177">However, in my case when I stressed Heflin case to them, they said that the Government had conceded the error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.143" offset="5815986">And since the Government conceded the error, they felt that was not -- they were not bound by their own decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.920" offset="5843048">When again they said, and this Court has said, the maximum penalty under (a), (b) and (d) which covers the classic bank robbery is 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.525" offset="5877426">In this case, 35 years was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.484" offset="5897279">Now, I submit and -- and this might answer the questions put to me that Congress meant to cover omissions, Huxman and Frank said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.993" offset="5939388">In dissenting opinions Huxman -- rather Frank was upheld by this Court in the Jerome versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.838" offset="5966764">It -- it supplies an omission in a certain kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.508" offset="5981393">That is, of course, if we -- if we say peaceful entries in the first place intended to be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.246" offset="6004381">We have four separate distinct crimes which can be put in place in compartments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.729" offset="6022248">If anyone has committed, then that particular crime would be the only crime chargeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.798" offset="6046595">If it is committed on aggravated circumstances, it then merged into (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.703" offset="6070209">Now, in our particular instance, I believe that Congress never intended to -- to place prohibitions against successive steps in this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.716" offset="6114200">They intended to supply an omission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.000" offset="6123395">When the transaction finally consummate in the intended act, it is the submission of the petitioner that that's what Congress wanted and therefore there is a merger so that the intended act is the one upon which sentence can be imposed and I believe no matter how we look at the legislative history, no matter how we examine this particular act, there is nothing to show that Congress intended any type of permitting as is done in this case and as can be done in another cases instead of the 25-year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.467" offset="6265292">Judge Edgerton once said that, in King v. United States, that sentencing should not be a game in which the wrong move by the court will grant immunity to the prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.512" offset="6305416">We have the same thing here just reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.431" offset="6321089">The prosecutor can by manipulation of the various sections of the statute, that is of each one of those crimes in (a) and (b) can be charged in addition to other crimes in (a) and (b) by merely manipulating the section of the statute, we can get sentences varying 50 to 60 years depending upon the ingenuity of the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.343" offset="6396740">Yet, this hasn't been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.066" offset="6407607">The courts have seemed to interpret this reasonably, except the Fifth Circuit in this particular type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.420" offset="6437073">There are no cases anywhere in our -- among our circuits that hold that what this Fifth Circuit has done in this case can be done in any other type of bank robbery case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.085" offset="6483675">So if the Court please, we feel that -- that the maximum sentence is 25 years imposable under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.310" offset="6520560">Now, armed robbery, which is a serious crime, the general prohibition against it will carry a sentence of about 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.034" offset="6559535">That's if no murder was done or any other harm, 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.967" offset="6583254">It does not seem conceivable that Congress intended the Bank Robbery Act to go beyond 25 years when no kidnapping or killing is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.687" offset="6630170">Yet, that's what can be done if the prosecutor and some of our district judges are giving a license to pyramid these offenses far beyond 25 years which seems to be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.554" offset="6685550">This Court itself has said in the Holiday case, the maximum sentence imposable under the Bank Robbery Act, of course, in that case, we had robbery and then aggravated robbery, and the court said you couldn't sentence on both, but the maximum sentence is 25 years and this Court has never changed its view and no other court in United States has changed its view except the Fifth Circuit and even that court, just last year held that 25 years was the maximum sentence, why it change its mind in our case, I do not know, but when this was pointed out, the court refused to follow its own decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.686" offset="6846151">Now -- now, if the Court please, we submit finally that armed robbery under aggravated circumstances which contains a maximum sentence imposable embraces the entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.600" offset="6901739">Congress, I believe, would be satisfied if this entry were embraced within the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.006" offset="6923368">I can use the word merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.781" offset="6930474">There is no intent to increase the penalties merely to cover the -- or expand the Act to include another type of crime which is larceny and burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.735" offset="6986271">So, as Justice Hudson once said, nothing is a crime unless specifically made so by a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.322" offset="7020648">Crimes do not arise by implication and that is what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.980" offset="7043323">We submit to Your Honors first that burglary was meant to be covered by the clear intention of Congress and if this Court feels that burglary should be expanded to include a peaceable type of entry which I submit is unheard-of under this type of case because everyone has a right to go into a bank, then in any event a merger was held because the maximum sentence is 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.897" offset="7146977">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Ms. Beatrice Rosenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="1765.988" offset="7167352">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.366" offset="7176861">We're dealing here with a statute first that's 1934 and amended by the material here in 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.939" offset="7215104">When that statute was proceeded by a number of decisions of this Court ranging by -- from the Burton case about 1905 through the Albrecht case in 273 United States, must have been in that -- in that period about 10 decisions dealing with the question of whether one transaction resulted in one offense or more than one offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.653" offset="7341955">And the court in that 30-year period spoke not only frequently but unequivocally consistently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.946" offset="7383124">And it is our basic position here that there is nothing in the legislative history or the language of this statute to take it out of those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.743" offset="7430353">But those decisions must -- cannot be ignored when you're trying to decide with intent of the legislature in 1937 with respect to a bill suggested by the Attorney General and that in the light of those decisions, entry with intent to rob and a robbery are separate in distinct offenses and separately punishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.105" offset="7563786">Now, out of the many decisions that were decided in this period between 1905 and 1937, (Inaudible) should I want to talk about in particular because I think it is fair to say that they established as the regular method of interpreting federal criminal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.602" offset="7657827">The proposition that where a statute rebating to what would normally be a series of steps in one transaction, the Act would normally be interpreted as punishing each step as well as the completed transaction itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.891" offset="7730970">In the first decision to that effect, Burton against the United States in 202 U.S., where the statute punished, in just one paragraph, anyone who shall agree to receive or receive any compensation of the type prohibited, Burton case discussed on page 17 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.617" offset="7841834">And the court there said, Congress intended place its condemnation upon each distinct, separate part of every transaction coming within the messages intended to be reached and remedied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.906" offset="7907035">Therefore, an agreement to receive compensation was made an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.071" offset="7935666">And so the receiving of compensation in violation of the statute whether pursuant to the previous agreement or not was made another in separate offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.364" offset="7988851">There is in our judgment no escape from this interpretation consistently with the established rule that the intention of a legislature must govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.106" offset="8031796">Now, I looked the briefs in those cases and the decision of the court itself and the intention of the legislature so far as it is manifested by the briefs or the opinion stems from no more than the words of the statute itself which I said in the beginning prohibited any member of Congress who “shall receive or agree to receive any compensation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.221" offset="8148302">Then in 237 United States, we come to a case that's very much in point to the problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.059" offset="8179649">Morgan against Devine dealing with the post office statute that post office offense is defined in one paragraph forcible entry with intent to commit a felony -- no, with intent to commit larceny -- what was section 190 of the Criminal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.837" offset="8258748">In another paragraph, larceny, the post office matter and the third paragraph which was not involved in Morgan against Devine also had a robbery statute with provision for increased punishment for the aggravated crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.161" offset="8335966">And to that particular problem of burglary followed by a larceny, there was that the opinion below admits a conflict in the federal courts and an even greater conflict as there is quite generally even now among the state as to when one transaction -- well, when it becomes one offense or two, whether one merges in the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.228" offset="8464280">And the court had argued to it and dealt specifically with the argument that after all what was involved in one post-office theft was -- that any intent at the time of entry was exactly the intent at the time of the stealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.465" offset="8545259">And in answer to that, the court said, it's quoted at page 15 in our brief, the test is not whether the criminal intent is one other thing inspiring the whole transaction, but whether separate acts have been committed with the requisite criminal intent and are such as are made punishable by the Act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.154" offset="8668035">And the very case to which I was to refer as the case of Albrecht against United States dealing with violations of the National Prohibition Act, which in one paragraph punished possession, manufacture, sale, receipt, almost anything that we don't have in relation to intoxicating liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.474" offset="8753298">Mr. Albrecht was punished or was charged an indictment with on the same day possession of liquor and sale of liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.124" offset="8803871">And the actual proof that was adduced was that somebody went in and ordered a drink and he went in the back and got out a bottle and gave him the drink.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.033" offset="8847548">That was the proof related to the possession and sale at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.569" offset="8865625">And the argument was made that that was not -- those -- those were not separate offenses and that since it was almost impossible to separate possession and the sale, that you couldn't make a sale without having possession, that there was a violation of the constitutional protection in double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.446" offset="8985161">And in answer to that, this Court said there was nothing in the constitution, that's quoted on page 18 of our brief, there is nothing in the constitution which prevents Congress from punishing separately each step leading to the consummation of a transaction which it has power to prohibit and punishing also the completed transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.037" offset="9079515">Now, that (Inaudible) in constitutional terms, but of course, to reach the constitutional problem, there also has to be a statutory construction problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.501" offset="9113370">It must have been -- it employs a holding, of course, that Congress did to intend to punish separately the possession and the sale of liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.294" offset="9176586">From -- we haven't attempted in our brief to summarize the -- I think literally hundred of Court of Appeals cases which follow the principles laid down by the courts in these cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2354.362" offset="9520776">Now, it seems to me that if this retained over, if this were the first criminal statute that was called upon to be construed, it could be regarded equivocal, I regard every one of these decisions by this Court as subject to arguments, one way or one another, various States have gone various ways on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.180" offset="9616071">It seems to me very valid and -- and very important, both as a matter of legislative intent, as a legislative intent of this statute to recognize that there was a climate of judicial thinking which presumably the Attorney General knew and -- and the members of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.728" offset="9698304">And that when you get to a statute where it seems to me neither the wording nor the legislative history per se is conclusive, it is very significant that for the whole 30 years preceding, that was the almost automatic approach of a court to this problem so much, though as a matter of fact and that I will come to in a moment taking up this particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.438" offset="9797151">When they had a statute which was different in one respect, and this was in relation to robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.244" offset="9832364">Most courts didn't recognize the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.743" offset="9842395">So that we had the problem that arose about Holiday against Johnston, which came from a particular format was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.186" offset="9876146">It -- it -- let me turn now to the legislative history of the statute to explain what I mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.885" offset="9898924">When the Attorney General suggested in 1934, he suggested a draft which is Appendix A of our brief on page 46.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.480" offset="9945318">And that read, there was a section punishing, driving into the bank with intent to commit a felony, common law of burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.187" offset="9992129">It was Section 4 (a) punishing robbery and 4 (b) with Section 3, punishing burglary, Section 4 punishing robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.075" offset="10039672">And it had robbery in the simple form, robbery in the aggravated form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.307" offset="10068616">And I had forgotten, I started at 3, I should have started at 2 which was the section punishing larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.266" offset="10092440">So we had one section punishing larceny, one section punishing burglary, one section punishing robbery, which (a) and (b) had the simple in the aggravated form with the greater offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.747" offset="10146356">For some reason not disclosed in the legislative history, Congress omitted in 1934, Congress decided not to make bank burglary or bank larceny an offense and it passed only the robbery part as a proposed draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.519" offset="10237471">And so we got what was 12 United States Code in the form before the 1948 revision, 588 (a) and (b), passed as such, so we had -- without -- the robbery provision alone with a provision for aggravated form and not the others which would made it clear that they were creating separate offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.313" offset="10336632">Now, I think that the bill had been passed in -- in its original form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.637" offset="10349902">It would never have gotten into the difficulties that it did because as with the separate burglary provision, the separate larceny provision and then the robbery provision simple and aggravated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.435" offset="10405073">It was clear from the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.584" offset="10421687">One, that the aggravated form of robbery related to robbery and also I think clear from the form of that statute in the light of the decisions of the time that burglary and larceny was separate from the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.868" offset="10494830">But coming as it did with just the robbery and with the general approach of separate statutes being separate offenses which had permeated federal thinking for 30 years before this statute was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.087" offset="10563688">What happened was that the great majority of district courts began to consider both robbery and aggravated robbery as separate offenses also and that was the form in which the statute read when Holiday against Johnson or at least at the time of a Holiday against Johnson offense by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.064" offset="10659610">And at that time when only robbery was punished by the statute, this Court said, “No, that's just one offense.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.643" offset="10705899">And the Government, as a matter of fact, agreed to that interpretation, but it was talking about the situation where we had what was originally Section 4 of the draft, simply robbery in the initial and aggravated form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.493" offset="10773295">And it was, in a sense, the result in confusion from being faced with a statute where the court has said, it was only offense which was extremely unusual in federal law that we get some of the problems here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2691.927" offset="10871097">The lower court said there were two offenses, robbery and aggravated, because they were still moving in this mental -- in this adverse here which you speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.917" offset="10911013">But by the time, Holiday and Johnston, the Holiday case statute with -- in 313, the air here began to be a little different.</text>

            <text syncTime="2710.656" offset="10946017">May I suggest, Your Honor, in that the Court of Appeals that they had it, did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.942" offset="10975169">It was largely based on the legislative history and based on the particular legislative history represented by Appendix A where I think, as I said, that in the form that -- if that statute had, where you have Section 2 or Section 3 and where the aggravated form applied only to larceny, it would have been done and after the change of climate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.784" offset="11062523">I was coming to that later because of the period between 1937 and 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.528" offset="11085511">May I point to the decision of this Court in 1947 in Michener against the United States, where -- what was involved was a 15 years sentence for possession of a counterfeit plate and a 15-year sentence for causing a counterfeit plate to have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.837" offset="11170670">Now, the Eighth Circuit in a very limited decision said, “We agree the possession and manufacture can often be separate offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.183" offset="11212152">But where the only possession you charge is that the very same time as a possession of a counterfeit plate about to be made, we think that merges.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.925" offset="11263039">Now, that was the conflict with the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.357" offset="11272756">As a matter of fact, this was the same defendant and that question was brought here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.275" offset="11292505">Now, as late as 1947 with this Court with some dissents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.742" offset="11310373">But nevertheless, this Court disposed of that question by reversing the Eighth Circuit in a per curiam opinion citing the cases that I have mentioned before including those I haven't undertaken to discuss here, Gavieres and some of the others that are cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.820" offset="11382680">So that if neither at the time of the enactment of this statute, nor at the time of the reenactment of the code in 1948, had there been any significant change in this general climate of approach which was to the effect that each step of a transaction as well as the whole transaction should -- could be separately punishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.248" offset="11512351">There were, in addition, judicial constructions specifically on this point which I won't get to it at this time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2901.704" offset="11710151">In that -- in that whether because courts have not given consecutive sentences for this or -- I do not know, but they aren't really about -- I suppose altogether about 10 cases where the question had been litigated, several of them for the -- from the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.766" offset="11806386">Now, those cases are discussed in our brief at pages 31 to 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.804" offset="11862601">And the most precise question, handling of this question, precisely dealing with the question of whether entry and the subsequent robbery were separate offenses was Wells against the United States in 124, coming from this same circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.209" offset="11956224">Now, there we had exactly all the difficulties, the fact that aggravated robbery and robbery itself had been sentenced to separate sentences as well as entry within intent to rob.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.323" offset="12008678">And the Court said it is true that aggravated -- that robbery and aggravated robbery are separate offenses -- are not separate offenses and therefore, you can punish only one for the aggravated form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.982" offset="12087254">But entry, on the other hand, is a separate offense and for that, consecutive sentences may be imposed because that's in court withholding in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.255" offset="12136364">I am almost afraid to point out since I am not attaching any significant to it, but the fact is that a petition for certiorari raising precisely that point of whether there could be an entrance with intent to rob was presented to this Court and denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.378" offset="12196864">Now, there was at that time no (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.426" offset="12209089">The other explicit holding on that point was in the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.902" offset="12222986">It was the same offense and it was dicta when the question was not correctly involved, but exclusive recognition of that same point of view by the Seventh and the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.636" offset="12285889">The case is cited at page 33 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.876" offset="12298846">As against that, there was one holding to the contrary in a rather oblique case which had complications in its sentence in another form in the Sixth Circuit and possible dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.939" offset="12359137">It's not even clear that the Court was ruling on this question in the Ninth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.876" offset="12378885">So that by the time of the reenactment, the way the judicial authority was in court with -- with what was then the prevailing view generally as federal criminal statute and that is to the effect that entry with intent to rob and robbery are separate offenses.</text>
