            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 51, Leslie Miller Incorporated, Appellant, versus the State of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.459" offset="145220">Mr. Gentry.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Leffel Gentry</label>
            <text syncTime="14.783" offset="162461">May it please, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.906" offset="183045">Leslie Miller is a corporation engaged in the general contracting business.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.935" offset="223065">As such a corporation it entered the -- it submitted a bid for the construction of certain facilities in the State of Arkansas in connection with an airport facility and it entered in the performance of that contract after having been awarded the bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.980" offset="343333">In this action appearing here, is the result of prosecution of Leslie Miller by the State of Arkansas for having violated the provisions of Act 124 of 1939 as amended by Act 217 of 1945, in that, as a general contractor, he had done these things without having been licensed by the State Licensing Board for General Contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.285" offset="516472">The action was tried in the lower court upon a stipulation of facts; and under that stipulation of facts in addition to those facts in the district county, it both appeared that bids were received for the construction of the facilities from licensed contractors within the State of Arkansas, but that such bids were in excess of the bid of the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.741" offset="634337">And it further appeared from the stipulation that other contractors would have submitted bids in connection with the construction of the facilities had it not been for the requirements that they first be licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.678" offset="706121">The appellant was convicted in the lower court, notwithstanding, his assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.535" offset="729527">Its assertion that the application of the Contractors Licensing Board Act, the Arkansas Contractors Licensing Board Act to wit was unconstitutional inasmuch as it amounted to an interference with the federal function that congressional acts and regulations pursuant thereto accomplished the purposes intended by the State Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.775" offset="870484">Upon appeal to the Supreme Court of Arkansas and again, the urging of that question, the Supreme Court of Arkansas affirmed the decision of the lower court from whence an appeal was brought to this Court and the Court -- the case is here on appeal by way, of course, the jurisdictional statement having been filed and the Court having indicated the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.344" offset="1012799">If Your Honors please, it's the position of the appellant in this case and first, I should say that the Government has filed a brief amicus curiae in the case and we are providing a ton as I understand under the directions we've been given and I shall confine myself to a general discussion of the principle involved here rather than to cover specifically the many instances in which we feel that there is an interference with the governmental function.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.927" offset="1179042">That feature of the case will be handled by counsel for the Government.There is a fundamental question involved here, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.348" offset="1232750">The question which necessarily arises at such a time when a State in the purported exercise of its sovereign police power enacts a measure such as the Act here on the consideration, the Contractors Licensing Board Act, which the Court will find as an appendix in the back of the jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.196" offset="1368168">This Act, supposedly by its title, has for its purpose the regulation of the practicing of general contracting within the State of Arkansas and general contracting within the State of Arkansas is then, thereafter, it defined so as to include, we can see the appellant in the instance of bidding upon the work for the Government and exercising the right to perform the contract after having been awarded the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.082" offset="1515708">In other words, there's no dispute between the parties as to the applicability of the Act in the sense that the corporation here is a general contractor under the definitions of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.425" offset="1565027">The issue here though arises, as to whether the State of Arkansas by this Act can require the appellant under the guise of police power to get a license in order to be able to contract with the Federal Government for the construction of the facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.726" offset="1666278">It is our position, in this case, that the Government of the Nation and the Government of the State are, of course, each alike, absolute and independent in its -- in their respective spheres, but when conflict arises, that the enactment of the National Government, of course, has supremacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.147" offset="1767946">In this instance, the question arises first as to a conflict and the question arises as to the conflict in two aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.047" offset="1819564">It is our position that there is no conflict between the congressional enactments and the right of Congress to regulate as to its ports, docks and arsenals under the Constitution's provision and under the regulations that have been enacted pursuant to the congressional enactment, that there is no conflict between the exercise of that power which Congress has undertaken, and the exercise of the State of its sovereign power to protect its citizens in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.036" offset="1991555">We say that for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.507" offset="1997406">The only object and purpose which the Act under consideration could possibly have is the protection of the welfare, safety and peace of the people of the State of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.109" offset="2063757">It could not have for its object and purpose the protection of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.891" offset="2094895">Then having solely for its purpose, the protection of the welfare, peace and safety of its citizens, if as a matter of fact, Congress in the exercise of it's expressly delegated exclusive power to regulate its ports, docks, arsenals which would include this airport construction, if it has acted, if Congress has acted, so as to regulate it and if in the course of its acting, it has, by its enactments, already done the thing which would be accomplished by the state Act that if it has so regulated that the State's -- that the citizens of the State's welfare, health and safety is amply protected, then we say that we have no issue really to decide other than the question of whether there is any conflict there.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.230" offset="2356328">And we say in this instance that there is no such conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.683" offset="2382137">A study of the Act showed that it could have but one purpose and that is, the protection of the citizens of the State of Arkansas from -- in their dealings with contractors from those contractors who were not qualified or who were not ethical, who were unscrupulous and so, would take advantage of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.369" offset="2500838">Now, that right can be protected and continue to be protected by the State of Arkansas through the application of this Act to all of the contractors who deal with the people in the State of Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.821" offset="2578683">There can be no purpose saved or served in applying the Act to the Government under the guise that the Government needs to be protected by the State of Arkansas in its dealings with contractors from those contractors who would deal with it unethically or unscrupulously.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.025" offset="2683486">So in the outset of this argument, if Your Honors please, I take the position seriously that there is no conflict between the sovereign power of Arkansas in the exercise of its police power under the Act under consideration with the exercise of the exclusive power of Congress to regulate as to these ports, docks, arsenals, airports, other matters that come within that terminology.</text>

            <text syncTime="689.117" offset="2859865">In the sense that the -- I should distinguish, I'd say.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.549" offset="2889540">If this is a plumbing contractor and he is dealing with the Government and the Government by its rules and regulations is able to protect itself from the plumbing contractor in its relationship with it and that is the only object and the purpose of the Act, then I say it could be -- possibly no reason for the issue to get to the point to where we have that question of the intergovernmental immunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.146" offset="3007927">Now, I go one step further.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="leffel_gentry" startTime="732.538" stopTime="834.502">
            <label>Mr. Leffel Gentry</label>
            <text syncTime="732.538" offset="3033527">You license plumbing contractors to protect the health of the people, but license mean the plumber's contractor to work on a particular job for the Government would not interfere with the health of the people so long as the only job that they did without a license was the job they performed for the Government, because the Government by its statutes has protected that citizen from the hazard which may come by reason of the qualifications that it has set forth that this contractor had -- must have.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.626" offset="3201860">In other words, we take the position, if Your Honors, please, that we are not dealing here with a situation similar to the situation involved in the Penn Milk case versus the Board of Milk Control Commission where you have a proposition to the decide between the inherent power of the State to protect the welfare of its citizens and against the power of the Government or the right of the Government to exercise a particular function exclusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.384" offset="3344906">We do not have that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.084" offset="3355669">Here, we have a situation which the contractor can perform the function under the regulations, under the congressional statutes for the Government without any fear as to the rights of the people or Arkansas being adversely affected.</text>

            <text syncTime="834.502" offset="3441351">Can we -- can we say, Mr. Gentry, as a matter of law that this licensing law does not protect among other people the workmen who are on these jobs, under the contract, employment contract.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leffel_gentry" startTime="851.348" stopTime="856.833">

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="856.833" offset="3530689">Well, I thought in some of these licensing laws like that, they have them in part because contractors didn't pay their -- their health and -- and work responsible in some instances so far as payment was concerned in the treatment of their employees and -- and other considerations of that kind.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leffel_gentry" startTime="883.468" stopTime="939.880">
            <label>Mr. Leffel Gentry</label>
            <text syncTime="883.468" offset="3637269">If, Your Honor, please, I can only answer that with reference again to the -- the specific statute, and I can't find, nowhere in this statute, any such intent and, of course, we do not have the advantage of having statements as to the intent like you have in congressional enactments by the committee reports in those matters that are statements there made.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.663" offset="3753984">We have to take the Act itself and read it all together and gain the intent from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.511" offset="3785435">But as far as I can see this Act and I may be prejudiced in the cause of my client, but as far as I can see it, I can see nothing except that it was intended to protect people in their dealings with contractors and it has no relation whatever to the employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="959.147" offset="3939976">Well, I think that answers part of that because I think it speaks in terminology of the qualifications of the contractors to perform the jobs that they're seeking to perform rather than dealing with the qualifications that they may have as far as dealing with their employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.600" offset="4025762">Now, if Your Honors, please, we take the position secondly, that if this Act has for its purpose, if this act has for its purpose the protection of the health, welfare and safety in the instance and which a contractor is dealing with the Federal Government, that if so, that then that protection that is sought to be afforded which we say is not there, not intended, but that that protection is afforded by the federal statutes and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.103" offset="4227741">And we do say this Your Honor that the imposition of this Act upon the appellant in this case will deprive the Government of its right to select its agent -- agents and determine the competency of those with whom it'd be.</text>

            <text syncTime="1067.066" offset="4371623">Well, it was a tremendous airport project in which there is a air base that is one of the larger air bases that the -- where the big bombers are and they have the personnel there that is refrain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.318" offset="4428675">They're on the base.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.366" offset="4432854">So it's a tremendous undertaking as far as the extent and size of the facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.672" offset="4458036">Now then, I would like to call your attention to this one thing in connection with the Chief Justice's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.799" offset="4494608">In this Act, it purports to define a general contractor as those making contracts for the construction of certain described things involving an amount in excess of $20,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.766" offset="4578408">Now then, I take the position that if anything is intended to be protected by that Act other than to protect the citizens of the State who deal with the contractor and not the Government when it deals with it, that if they were intended to protect the safety and health and so forth of the employee over here or his welfare as the Chief Justice has mentioned, then his safety, health and welfare is just as well involved in a contract involving $19,000 as it is and one involving $20,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.420" offset="4741099">So, I use that as an illustration to say that this Act in my humble opinion could have no object and purpose except the protection of the local citizens from unscrupulous contractors and its absobility or its inabsolubility, I should say, to the Government, because of the reasons we here assert would not let the protection which was intended to be both, are purported by that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2148.964" offset="8699277">Actually, this Court has adopted two general approaches to these governmental immunity cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.356" offset="8724773">Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch against Maryland analyzed, posed the issue as one of sovereignty, a clash between two independent and indeed, he treated them as antagonistic sovereigns and then he would decide the -- the question on the basis of the Supremacy Clause in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.010" offset="8807424">Justice Holmes, on the other hand, and I refer particularly to Johnson against Maryland, 254 U.S.51 approached the issue as one of adjusting the interest of two related sovereigns whose functions overlapped and that the solution being to permit each to perform insofar as possible his functions without undue interference with the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.810" offset="8918601">When these two approaches appear irreconcilable that troubles come.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.240" offset="8944306">As for example in the recent case in this Court in New York against United States, where the question was the power of the United States to tax the State of New York on the sale of mineral waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.733" offset="8994356">But in this particular case, I think that either Chief Justice Michael or Mr. Justice Holmes would have come up the same answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.648" offset="9033958">On the McCulloch against Maryland approach, there can be no question that the duty to provide for the National Defense is one of the enumerated powers of the Federal Government and there can be no question that the building of airfields and the equipping of airfields which was involved in this case is part of that constitutional power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.687" offset="9130088">Under Article 6 of the Constitution then, it is not possible for the State to interfere with the federal exercise of this particular power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.054" offset="9167600">On the other hand, the power to license, which the State of Arkansas insists upon, must certainly involve the power to deny a license; and the power to deny a license certainly interferes with the power to build an airfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.788" offset="9238549">And therefore, by the syllogism which Justice -- Chief Justice Marshal would follow, this statute would be unconstitutional.But if we approach the problem as a problem of adjusting, accommodating the state powers and the federal powers so as to permit each one to be fulfilled with greatest possible extent, here, we have a state power, a state statute which is designed to protect the people, building things in Arkansas, from being treated by unreliable contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.376" offset="9400926">This isn't the building code.</text>

            <text syncTime="2328.910" offset="9419003">It is a law to promote fair business and as I said a minute ago, I think this is a legitimate exercise of -- of police power and obviously, the -- the federal aim to build and equip this airfield is not basically antagonistic to this state power.</text>
