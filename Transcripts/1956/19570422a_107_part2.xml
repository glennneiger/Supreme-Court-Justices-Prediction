            <text syncTime="10.718" offset="147289">And If you recall, the temporary injunction was granted in September and the trial took place shortly before Christmas.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.463" offset="194205">After deliberating over the question, despite the law of saying that judgments have to be made within two days.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.162" offset="249062">The court took until, I think subsequent June before he rendered a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.439" offset="294201">The injunction restrained these appellants from distributing, selling or acquiring possession of these books.</text>

            <label>Mr. Emanuel Redfield</label>
            <text syncTime="89.242" offset="461385">Yes, and in that action, of course, I raised the constitutional questions that I'm here raising.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.645" offset="511018">But the court held the law to be constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.477" offset="530348">It held that there was no prior restraint involved and the very voluminous opinion written seems to focus its attention on the fact that these books were so bad that it didn't appeal to this judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.037" offset="616552">He also held that the law will be constitutional because no prior restraint was involved in that by analogy to certain picketing cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.074" offset="680709">There could not be a prior restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.756" offset="699413">Then we appealed to the Court of Appeals of New York, and the court there sustained the constitutionality of the statute with three judges siding with one opinion and three judges with another opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.526" offset="806515">In my argument as I stated earlier, the only issue is would a prior restraint by this injunctive procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.710" offset="871194">In attacking this problem, for the moment, I have to omit the feature of obscenity, I will come to that and if I don't have time to come to it, it's in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.632" offset="922917">And we have to start with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.366" offset="945904">What is the effect of this statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="215.659" offset="967011">Under the law of both the statute and the general equity procedures in New York, a stay was obtained, a temporary injunction was granted and seizure of the books follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.674" offset="1055096">The statute therefore in effect, and that is the important element, in effect operates to prevent the publication from reaching the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.426" offset="1122074">The injunction might well issue before the books are even bound, if they're merely being printed and held ready for distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.439" offset="1186126">And in that sense the advice goes to the very heart of protecting publications from suppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.699" offset="1263240">It was established long ago in this Court, that distribution is protected as well as publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.893" offset="1311932">The (Inaudible) case holds that.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.781" offset="1327501">And if distribution is protected as well as publication, then I don't see that it makes any difference whether or not this book is directed against somebody who has a manuscript only or whether it's directed against distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.328" offset="1413705">In both cases the suppression is effectual.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.062" offset="1436693">The books cannot reach the public.Only recently, this Court held in Butler against Michigan, that the public's interest to be able to read what is published is a right that must be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.068" offset="1528644">And if this injunction deprives the public of that right, it well comes within the scope of that Butler articulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.778" offset="1587472">Now --</text>

            <text syncTime="405.691" offset="1727175">I -- in other words, if I were defending a person convicted such as you mention, I might well raise at that time the question as to whether or not the Court make -- I mean that whoever is empowered, whichever public officer is empowered to destroy, may be violating the constitutional rights of -- the both, the public to read and also of the person who owns those books.</text>

            <text syncTime="511.406" offset="2150045">Now, in Near against Minnesota, this Court had before it a case which I think is not only a guide but as an authority for determination of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.546" offset="2254535">The only difference being that in Near, you have a libel situation, whereas here one of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.152" offset="2305003">In Near, this person published a magazine -- a newspaper -- a weekly newspaper that was sought to be enjoined under the Minnesota statute, comparable in every way to this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.264" offset="2397477">The statute enable public officer to go into Court and get an injunction against the distribution of any publication, present or future on the ground that such a publication was a public nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.491" offset="2494339">And the public nuisance is that of being either libelous or else obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.755" offset="2551390">And this Court voided that Minnesota statute, so far as it applied to that particular issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.075" offset="2596739">The issue there being that the newspapers were very libelous and they were certainly were very libelous.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.780" offset="2647521">The Court held that the issue there was not punishment of Near but rather suppression.</text>

            <text syncTime="680.986" offset="2828392">What he said there, if you recall, was not well articulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.738" offset="2847305">That is, he didn't treat it comprehensively.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.564" offset="2854619">It was just one of those passing remarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.215" offset="2865277">It was not based upon any authority under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.424" offset="2882100">There were no decisions prior thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.493" offset="2890355">There were no statutory or constitutional provisions covering that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.730" offset="2911357">He just made that remark in passing.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.249" offset="2921388">It was pure dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.892" offset="2927971">Now, what he said there is obscure, too, because whether or not he referred to criminal prosecutions or referred to civil suits, is not made clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.199" offset="2997144">Therefore, I say that the Near case, so far as obscenity is concerned, cannot be deemed the authoritative.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.251" offset="3037372">All that was involved in that particular case were these libelous newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.841" offset="3067779">And I dare say, that if one were given the choice between the fulminations of newspapers like Near's, in which he libeled race, people, innumerable public officials and did it continuously, if one were to give a choice between that and some of this stuff that is termed obscene, I'm sure that there are many people who would think that the obscene were a lesser evil, for the reason as we all know that some of the fulminations that appear in the Near magazines were comparable to the Hitler ranklings that resulted in about six million people dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.675" offset="3323047">Now, whether obscene, books can produce six million dead, I don't know.</text>

            <text syncTime="1283.819" offset="5239704">Now, if you take that kind of an appeal, you'll bring before the appellate division in a non-jury case every question which was before the judge below.</text>

            <text syncTime="1822.384" offset="7393970">Now, that it seems to me points up the very narrow issues here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.861" offset="7431795">Now, throughout his brief, counsel has spent a great deal of time on the Near case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.092" offset="7480801">And he pens almost all of his argument on what he says was the holding in the Near case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.297" offset="7513610">Because in the Near case the Minnesota statute, which was under attack, permitted the enjoining of future publications of the particular issues involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.076" offset="7564706">And this Court held that that was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.228" offset="7581320">Now, counsel says that's true but also involved in the Near case were some issues of the particular magazine which -- which had already published.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.221" offset="7617264">And the judgment enjoined the -- the judgment appeal from enjoining the sale or distribution of those particular issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.108" offset="7648820">And therefore says, counsel that's just like our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.514" offset="7666479">Now, actually, of course, the thrust of the Near case was against the publication of the future issues because the Near case which -- was one -- which were -- was brought against the publisher.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.031" offset="7720500">It's true that incidentally involved in Near were some copies of the -- of the newspaper which had already been published.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.405" offset="7754041">But nobody was particularly interested in those if it'd be just as though you were trying to get an injunction against the New York Times with reference to future publications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.954" offset="7800226">Now, of course, nobody would be very much interested in whether issues of the Times which were lying around at all and had already been printed and were a week or a month old were being circulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.412" offset="7850068">It's the future issues of the magazine involved which were the main thing in the Near case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.192" offset="7885176">And these incidental matters were simply caught up in the sweep, so to speak, in the whole thrust of the Court's opinion, as I read it, was aimed at those future issues.</text>
