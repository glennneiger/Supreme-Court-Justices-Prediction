            <text syncTime="860.893" offset="3546990">Now, the plaintiffs, who are three individuals, residents of Illinois, partners and a fourth individual, who was at one time and seeks again to be an agent of the other three plaintiffs' partnership, filed this suit in the United States District Court asserting that they desire to go into the business of selling money orders with their own capital, and I shall come to the extent of their capital in a few moments, and engage in competition with the American Express Company, but charge that they are inhibited from engaging in that desired enterprise by the admonitions of public officials that such business would violate the Act and that they would be subject to penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.472" offset="3873311">Thereupon, they filed this suit assailing the Act in its application to them and they contend that the exemption of the American Express Company, they do not advert to the expression of the -- exemption of the telegraph companies or, of course, the United States Post Office, but the exemption of the American Express Company by name and not by some standard of definition or statutorily enacted their norm is an invidious discrimination against them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1117.119" offset="4571826">Now, the District Court referred question of its jurisdiction, the propriety of the exercise of that jurisdiction to the merits, and first entered a decision of judgment in which it declared that it was without jurisdiction to decide the case and Your Honors noted probable jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.660" offset="4721977">Your Honors heard this case last year and Your Honors reversed the case without consideration and -- or at least certainly without intimation or advertence to any matter of the merits, held that the District Court had abdicated the jurisdiction that it did possess but made it clear that Your Honors were not telling the Court whether it should exercise that jurisdiction or remit the parties to the state court for a consideration of the -- both the federal constitutional questions and (Inaudible) of several ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.809" offset="4918627">Pursuant to that order of remandment on the part of Your Honors, the District Court, which is I have explained, had previously -- actually heard the case on the evidence, entered an opinion without further argument or hearing in which they held that they regarded it, this Illinois expression in the McDougall case to which I -- which I mentioned in answer to Mr. Justice Brennan's question as rendering it unnecessary for the plaintiffs to repair the state court for recourse to the federal courts, reached the subsidy of constitutional question on the merits, held the exemption, held the Act of discriminatory as to the -- in its application to the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.056" offset="5163551">It did not undertake to invalidate it in total and entered a declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction restraining the state officers from the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.946" offset="5235127">The substantive question that emerges, which I shall I address first is -- well, I think maybe the fairest way to state it is if I may just read three lines from the conclusion of -- not our brief but the appellee's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.739" offset="5322376">The appellee says this, its appellee's own language in -- in their conclusion at page 23 of their brief, the inclusion and the definition of the term "community and currency exchange" of one who is “engaged in the business of selling or issuing money orders“ coupled with the exemption by name of a concerned and engaged in that very business renders a statute discriminatory and unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.522" offset="5441494">Question - Is that contention stated in appellee's own language, one that should prevail on this appeal?</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.856" offset="5486843">That is the subsidy of constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.539" offset="5501576">Now, the -- I shall come -- and when I deemed to be inappropriate time in my argument, unless requested to come sooner by question from some member of the Court to the United States Supreme Court decisions on which we rely as vindicating the general proposition that exemptions by name of private corporations are proper where the exception itself is appropriate and not discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.939" offset="5631143">But first, with Your Honor's indulgence, I should like to compare or I should more preferably say contest the activities and operations of the American Express Company with the operation of the plaintiffs and then I shall come to the matter of the authorities that sanction and exemption by particular names.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.904" offset="5763009">The American Express Company, the record is replete with evidence of the very great distinctions other than those of sides alone between the American Express Company and the business that the plaintiffs aspired to conduct in Illinois and in fact do conduct in Illinois and Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.582" offset="5877739">Cardinal among those distinctions are these signally differentiated events.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.118" offset="5919848">American Express Company was founded in 1882.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.415" offset="5941060">Plaintiff's business was not either born or conceived in Illinois when this Act was passed, circumstances that might have warranted an exception by the principle of the grandfather clause but that's not primarily relied on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.030" offset="6015457">American Express Company does business, and if my memory serve me correctly, 55 foreign countries as well as throughout the entire United States, the record doesn't show to what extent the American Express Company is in fact subjected to what might be called an official type of scrutinizing regulation in all of these 55 foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.026" offset="6155473">But it does show that the American Express Company comporting itself and has for about three quarters of a century comported itself in such a manner as to satisfy not only the regulatory authorities of the United States and 55 other countries but the established business institutions that depend on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.715" offset="6258186">The record shows, if Your Honors please, that the American Express Company has on many occasions and in many respects acted as the fiscal agent for the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.115" offset="6311790">The record shows that the American Express Company has a wholly owned subsidiary banking corporation, which is regulated and subject to the supervision of the banking laws of the State of New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="2807.607" offset="11333778">But as I understand them, their only argument and certainly their chief argument is that if you have enacted a set of standards in generic terms, any corporation, I would say you'd have to get all of these factors in but get cardinal features in, engaged in the international business of writing money orders, having a half a billion dollars in free assets, which American Express Company does, having been in business for 50 years, American Express Company's history is longer than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.243" offset="11572328">And perhaps adding other ingredients, which I don't think would be necessary.But he put in generic terms, so that if American Express Company withers and its assets fall below this half a billion or a quarter of a billion or whatever amount, put an amount many times or anything that the -- that the plaintiffs have or them, American Express Company, would automatically be excluded because it would now have ceased to comply like the taverns.</text>

            <text syncTime="5233.612" offset="21037850">I would like to discuss briefly the questions of -- first of severability.</text>
            <text syncTime="5242.552" offset="21073586">In the record at page 532, one of the questions presented, the second question presented in this case is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5255.023" offset="21123427">If the exemption of American Express Company money orders from the Act is an unconstitutional provision, should the District Court have held that the provision was severable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5269.411" offset="21181001">And in the appellant's brief at page 5, they have substantially the same statement as a question presented to this Court, whether or not the District Court should have determined that this exemption was severable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.824" offset="21262712">In other words, the question is presented to this Court was at error for the District Court not to determine that it was severable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5303.156" offset="21316002">However, we find no argument in this brief to this Court that the exemption is severable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5316.779" offset="21370441">Now, that is a very important question because if this exemption is severable, then this law applies to the American Express Company and the appellees and everybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="5331.823" offset="21430627">That would be the effect of holding this exemption unconstitutional but severable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5341.482" offset="21469288">The only thing in the appellant's brief along that line, they don't pursue the question presented in their assignment of error and their notice of appeal, but the end on page 25 with the conclusion that severability is a question that might be more appropriately left for adjudication to the Illinois Supreme Court citing Liggett against Lee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5371.731" offset="21590288">Now, as our brief shows when the question of severability comes up -- when a case comes up from a federal court, the lower federal court, the question of severability may be determined by the lower federal court and by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5391.935" offset="21671163">It is when a case comes from a state court that this Court says the question of severability is more appropriately determined by the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5403.283" offset="21716511">That was held in two cases in the 238 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="5409.175" offset="21740022">The first one was the Guinn case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5412.309" offset="21752560">The Guinn case came up from the lower federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5414.876" offset="21762905">It involved the validity of some regulations as to the right to vote and the statute had a grandfather clause in it and also a literacy test.</text>
            <text syncTime="5429.105" offset="21819747">And this Court held that the grandfather clause was a discriminatory and a depravation of the equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="5437.752" offset="21854333">It found that the literacy test was not invalid but it said they are so interwoven in the statute that we can't say they would have passed the one without the other and so they said it is not severable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5452.031" offset="21911489">And they said having come up for the lower federal court, we can and will decide it and they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="5460.395" offset="21944926">The other case was the Myers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5462.009" offset="21951404">I think they're right together in 238.</text>
            <text syncTime="5466.047" offset="21967600">Later on, there was the Dorchy case that we cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="5468.501" offset="21977422">However, it was a state -- a case from the state court and they stated the law, cited the Guinn case, Myers case, I think perhaps another one and they said it is more appropriate when the case comes from the state court or the state court to determine that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5487.030" offset="22051506">However, whether it is victim or whether it is not, certainly, the statement of the Supreme Court of Illinois that the legislature surely would not had passed this statute without the exemption in it is to say at least entitled to considerable weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="5507.150" offset="22131963">Now, there's another reason why we submit that this exemption provision is not severable and that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5514.911" offset="22162996">It is in the definition of currency exchanges, the term currency exchanges occurs in 17 sections of the statute, some 60 times, I believe, and when you change the definition, you change the meaning of 17 sections in the statute, which we submit is a reason why the -- it is not severable.</text>
