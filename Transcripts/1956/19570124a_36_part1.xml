            <text syncTime="18.340" offset="176776">I shall now try in the 26 minutes remaining to cover the facts and the principal points that we want to have the Court hear us on.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.697" offset="234141">Obviously, some of them will have to rest in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.439" offset="253158">First, the chronology in 1940, after passage of the Investment Company Act, the appellant Allegheny became a registered investment company.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.580" offset="309687">As Your Honors know, that Act does not cover all investment companies, but only a limited number of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.963" offset="335182">There are many exceptions and exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.345" offset="348766">It would be quite wrong to suppose that the limitations which the court below has put on Interstate Commerce Commission jurisdiction resulted in transferring all those potential carrier holding companies to the jurisdiction of the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.327" offset="424730">because it wouldn't have an effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.890" offset="434970">The particular exception which we are concerned with here and which we think the court below has inadequately given weight to, is that any company subject to regulation to the Interstate Commerce Commission Act is not within the Investment Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.623" offset="521906">Under the Interstate Commerce Commission Act, sections 5 (2) and 5 (3), a company which was a non-carrier could be brought under Interstate Commerce Commission jurisdiction if it sought to acquire in any manner another carrier so that if a company controlled two carriers in any fashion that was subject to I.C.C. jurisdiction and control in the Interstate Commerce Act was defined in section 1 subdivision 3 (b) in the very broadest terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.399" offset="685014">In 1944, Allegheny controlled the C &amp; O.And in that year, it applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission for an order approving a change in the status of the Norfolk Terminal Company applied with the C &amp; O for approval of a change in the status and to have Allegheny thus brought within the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission as a non-carrier holding an interest or controlling two carriers.</text>

            <text syncTime="244.609" offset="1081762">Now, I'll come to that more specifically in connection with the later proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.859" offset="1102764">The Interstate Commerce Commission granted that application, conceding that it was following the then very recent decision of this Court in United States against Marshall in the 322.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.388" offset="1156890">And ever since that time, the Commission has I think without -- certainly, without any substantial exception, always taken the view that a company which was in the position of Allegheny and which proposed a change in the relationship to any of the carriers involved was subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.736" offset="1270366">And indeed, in the court below, the Government and the Commission both agree that under the Marshall case and under the New York Central Securities case, the construction of the Commission has always put on the statute was the correct one.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.767" offset="1342464">So, the Commission in 1945 brought Allegheny as a non-carrier under its regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.973" offset="1379244">That order explicitly provided that it should be considered a carrier unless and until otherwise ordered by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.093" offset="1415711">That order appearing at the record page 183.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.472" offset="1433266">And ever since that time, Allegheny has continued to be a non-carrier subject to the regulation of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.255" offset="1476420">In 1945, when the SEC discovered the action of the Interstate Commerce Commission or it was brought to its attention, the SEC held a hearing and entered an order concluding that Allegheny was no longer an investment company, but was subject to regulation under the Interstate Commerce Act and was accepted from the Investment Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.011" offset="1599404">And that order also provided that if in the future, Allegheny ceases to be subject to regulation under the Interstate Commerce Act, the SEC order might be revoked, suspended at or suspended after notice and hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.788" offset="1666487">That order is still outstanding and has never been revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.415" offset="1689057">Thus, both Commissions in 1945 explicitly held that Allegheny was subject the regulation of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.510" offset="1745377">Both Commissions ordered that their order should be continue until revoked and indeed the statute's applicable to both Commissions, made that provision a necessary, consequence of any order, anyhow.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.730" offset="1814340">So, we have a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.532" offset="1821550">We start with the situation that the Interstate Commerce Commission asserted and never relinquished jurisdiction over Allegheny and the SEC conceded and never canceled its order recognizing that jurisdiction.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="446.108" offset="1887796">I -- I understand that Allegheny has not divested itself of holdings in C &amp; O?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="whitney_north_seymour" startTime="451.959" stopTime="635.134">
            <label>Mr. Whitney North Seymour</label>
            <text syncTime="451.959" offset="1911202">Yes, I'm coming that right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.238" offset="1920293">In 1954, Allegheny completed its disposition of its C &amp; O holdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.480" offset="1953311">It notified the Interstate Commerce Commission that having divested itself, it considered itself free to acquire an interest in New York Central and thereupon, proceeded in a -- what was a notable proxy battle to gain control of New York Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.111" offset="2039829">Now, there's no real question here I think about that operation although, I'll come to two matters connection -- connected with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.755" offset="2074415">The court below thought, and I think the appellees contend, that it was necessary to obtain Interstate Commerce Commission approval for that acquisition, but it seems quite clear from the Commission's interpretation of its statute that it has never taken the view that acquiring one carrier required its approval even though a very important carrier was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.267" offset="2180472">And so, there was no failure I think to comply with the statute in not applying for approval of the acquisition in New York Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.146" offset="2219969">Your Honors will see at once that applying to get leave to win a proxy contest or approve the winning of a proxy contest would make such contest virtually impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.991" offset="2271378">But, however that may be, immediately after that, Allegheny again made application to the Commission and the Commission reasserted and continued its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.456" offset="2321220">So, even if there was any need to get approved of the New York Central acquisition which we think that clearly was not, the Commission continued its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.530" offset="2369494">Now, appellees raised some question about whether in fact Allegheny controlled New York Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.471" offset="2413275">I don't propose to spend much time on that because I think it's probably plain on this record that there is no such question that Your Honors need to be concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.195" offset="2452146">The Commission made very full and adequate findings on that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.722" offset="2474297">And under the broad control which they were entitled to determine, I think there can be no doubt about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.554" offset="2505540">I mean the appellee, Breswick at page 322 of the record in one of the many papers that were filed by Brewick with the Commission conceded the control.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.880" offset="2554859">In the court below, the Government agreed that there was control.Here, the Government doesn't discuss the matter but assumes it arguendo.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.461" offset="2597177">And I don't think Your Honors will have any doubt about it and I don't spend -- propose to spend any time on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="635.134" offset="2643884">Didn't the (Inaudible) mean that the case should go back for a finding by the Commissions on the question of control?</text>

            <label>Mr. Whitney North Seymour</label>
            <text syncTime="643.958" offset="2679202">Well, that wasn't the final disposition of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.520" offset="2693413">That the final -- there was some suggestion in the earlier opinion that some further finding might be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.120" offset="2719848">But in the end, the injunction was simply a flat injunction, without any direction for recommitting it to the Commission and I take it that that was their ultimate disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.147" offset="2767914">As Your Honor will see, examining the opinion on the temporary injunction and the opinion on the final injunction, the Court shifted its position a little bit between those two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.680" offset="2810128">Certainly, it did not remand it to the Commission for a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.377" offset="2824861">After Allegheny got the control of -- of Central, the Commission raised some question about whether ought to terminate its 1945 order which was based upon the application in the C &amp; O case.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.484" offset="2885360">And at Allegheny's request, it postponed action on that suggestion because Allegheny said that it was about to apply for a further order from the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.959" offset="2935202">SEC also inquired about the possibility of terminating its order, but postponed any consideration of that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.369" offset="2976893">And thereupon, shortly after that question was raised, Allegheny joined with Central in one of the two critical matters which I think are raised by this record, in applying to the Interstate Commerce Commission for approval of a change in the control of the Louisville Bridge Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.440" offset="3093086">And that was a situation which contemplated a merger of the Bridge Company into the Big Four and a change in the lease between Big Four and Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.351" offset="3160795">Now, I submit that those were significant changes in the relationship of the general order of the changes which Your Honors held in the New York Central Security's case required participation and the matter was fully considered by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.681" offset="3254105">The Commission granted that application after full consideration and issued an order continuing the jurisdiction over Allegheny as a company, as a non-carrier which should be treated as a carrier.</text>

            <label>Mr. Whitney North Seymour</label>
            <text syncTime="929.318" offset="3820648">Well, the Commission, of course, has a very considerable interest under its statute in controlling and regulating the activities of such companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.470" offset="3865266">And if there is control to bring it within the statute, I should think the Commission was in a position where it could exert regulation over.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.256" offset="3896404">Now, the order in this -- in this Bridge Company proceeding which appears at the record at page 446 did several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.532" offset="3945514">First, it directed that Allegheny as a non-carrier should be subject to the regulation of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.143" offset="3987937">Second, having just asserted its -- its regulation by that paragraph, it vacated its earlier order which was related to the C &amp; O.And the proper interpretation and the proper way to begin with that order is one of the questions in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.094" offset="4075708">Prior to the time that order was entered, the SEC intervened and without raising any question about the -- the jurisdiction of the I.C.C. indicated that it would be a nice thing if the I.C.C. would turn the jurisdiction over to the SEC, but the I.C.C. declined to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.895" offset="4158986">Now, I submit that it's perfectly apparent from this course of events with the I.C.C. regulating and -- and having Allegheny under its regulation from 1945 until its order in 1955, that it was not intending to terminate its control over Allegheny unless it's reassertion of regulation in that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.733" offset="4258356">Its continuation of jurisdiction in that order was affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.474" offset="4277269">And yet, the court below -- I'll have -- I'll come back to this at this time and that the other side and the -- the Department of Justice suggests in this Court although the Department of Justice I think took the other view below that determination of that 19 -- that the termination provision of that 1945 order terminated the Interstate Commerce Commission's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.027" offset="4383431">Now, it's perfectly apparent that that was a sort of a conditional determination conditioned upon its continue -- continued jurisdiction under the earlier order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.268" offset="4428466">Now, while the application in the Bridge Company matter was pending, Allegheny joined with Central in another application, seeking the same sort of approval and the same sort of an order in connection with the change in the relationship to the Boston &amp; Albany and two other carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.469" offset="4525223">And those carriers had formerly been under lease to the Central and this was a -- a request for approval of the acquisition of their stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.941" offset="4571094">And the Commission granted that application, but it granted it 20 days after the Bridge Company application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.421" offset="4609024">It made it clear that it was doing so consistently with its disposition to the Bridge Company application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.352" offset="4636818">But having only 20 days before entered an order expressly asserting that Allegheny was a non-carrier subject to its regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.411" offset="4681017">It did not repeat that formula in that order and the court below and the other side take the view that the absence of a reference to that same continued regulation somehow makes that order ineffective as regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.982" offset="4763251">Now, I submit that you have to take those orders together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.570" offset="4777671">They all represent an assertion of control over Allegheny under circumstances which gave the Commission control and that to give the weight in these circumstances to the absence of that particular phrase or clause in that order, disregard substance in favor or form.</text>

            <text syncTime="1308.195" offset="5336168">That proposal was submitted to stockholders in the early part of 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.937" offset="5363127">Before it was submitted to stockholders, a proxy embodying a very full statement of the -- all considerations affecting the stock.</text>

            <text syncTime="1349.262" offset="5500426">The matter was fully presented to the Commission for approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.358" offset="5516831">The Commission approved it and issued an order of approval at the end of March and -- or at the end of May, and the -- under the terms of the offer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1380.163" offset="5624038">And then, the appellees who had intervened before the Commission filed a motion for reargument and filed this suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1413.958" offset="5759248">Then, they filed this suit in the court below and this suit in its original form was a suit to enjoin the Bridge Company order, nothing about any stock order, nothing about the stock issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.440" offset="5825181">The only parties in the original action were the Commission and the United States.On June 16th, the plaintiffs made a motion for a temporary injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1445.570" offset="5885680">At their request, as I understand it, the -- the matter was adjourned to June 30th, but at least it wasn't at Allegheny's request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.267" offset="5920475">Allegheny wasn't a party and when Allegheny sought on June 21st to intervene, its proposed intervention was rejected by the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.716" offset="5962271">On June 22nd, the Commission order approving the stock issue came down, came to Allegheny's attention on June 23rd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.578" offset="5997693">They were obligated by their agreement with their stockholders to start exchanging stock immediately, and they did so.And the afternoon of that day, the temporary restraining order was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.891" offset="6062895">Now, here was a situation in which plaintiffs who'd been fully heard in the Commission who brought a suit not naming Allegheny, who did not in the suit has filled, ask any relief against the stockholder, whose temporary -- whose temporary injunction application didn't involve the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.476" offset="6141262">And directors and officers faced with a potential, very heavy liability to stockholders because if the market had gone down and they failed to make good on the exchange, they would have been liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.957" offset="6183163">And so, they proceeded to start to make the exchange and the temporary injunction issued and ultimately a preliminary injunction issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.368" offset="6220884">As Your Honors will see, Judge Hincks dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.120" offset="6231855">His view was that this was not a proper suit under the Urgent Deficiencies Act that the plaintiffs were trying to enforce the Investment Company Act which was not a proper purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.209" offset="6284204">His opinion is cast in terms of absence of -- of irreparable damage, but that's obviously what he's talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.230" offset="6316283">I'm very sorry, but my -- I must keep my obligation about time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.859" offset="6330807">May I say just one word more and then I'll sit down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.499" offset="6345331">We submit that these orders of the Commission were valid and effective and that Allegheny has been subject to Commission jurisdiction and subject to the Commission's approval of this preferred stock and that the injunction should be reversed not on the -- the rather informal grounds suggested by the Solicitor General, but because it is -- it was a -- an injunction which the court below had no right to issue that it has ousted the Interstate Commence Commission of jurisdiction long enjoyed and -- and which Congress has imposed upon it and that this injunction has had the most disastrous effect upon the company and upon its stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.281" offset="6528502">Now, every other question I must leave on the briefs is a grave question about the standing of these plaintiffs to maintain this action, a very grave question about the -- I think there's no real question about the jurisdiction of the I.C.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.182" offset="6588061">They raised some procedural questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1678.479" offset="6817311">Section 5 (2) (a) provides that it shall be lawful with the approval of the Commission for a person which is not a carrier and which already controls one carrier, to -- to acquire control of another carrier or carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.106" offset="6891813">And paragraph (3) provides that where such a non-carrier is thus authorized by the Commission to acquire control of a total of two or more carriers that such non-carrier person shall thereafter to the extent specified by the Commission be considered as a carrier subject to the probations of section 20 in the Interstate Commence Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.242" offset="6988361">Section 20 contains the -- the Commission's broad powers as to reports, the form of which accounts are kept and as general -- shall I say visitorial powers and for the provisions of section 20a, which briefly stated, "Requires the Commission's approval for the issuance of securities or assumption of carrier liabilities."</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.633" offset="7085955">In this case, the Commission asserted jurisdiction over Allegheny upon the basis of two factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.289" offset="7116570">First, it found that Allegheny already controlled one carrier, New York Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.821" offset="7142693">And secondly, it found that Allegheny through its control of Central was seeking to acquire a modified control over the Louisville &amp; Jeffersonville Bridge Company.</text>

            <text syncTime="1838.015" offset="7455431">The District Court found that the Commission could not assert jurisdiction of Alleghany as a pseudo carrier under section 5 (3), without first to finding that Alleghany's acquisition of control of New York Central was in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.112" offset="7519796">So, the -- in effect, the issue was forced upon us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.469" offset="7537246">Now, the court below held that since both before and after this merger and lease transactions, Alleghany had one form of control or another an indirect control over the Bridge Company properties that there was not involved any acquisition of control over the Bridge Company by Alleghany.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.646" offset="7649991">In other words, the court below held that this non-carrier provisions of section -- of paragraphs 2 and 3 of section 5 apply only to non-carriers acquiring control over previously -- previously uncontrolled carriers and do not apply to modifications of existing control of carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.762" offset="7754376">Now, we think that that's too literal, a reading of section 5 in view of the sweeping purposes of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.748" offset="7790320">Now, to go back a bit, it's undisputed that the merger of the Bridge Company into Big Four and the simultaneous lease of the Bridge Company properties by Big Four to New York Central were transactions which require the Commission's approval, the District Court so found and sustained those -- that portion of the Commission's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.588" offset="7889690">And through the years, the Commission has held repeatedly that where one carrier controls another carrier, increases in or modifications of carrier A's control of carrier B, require the Commission's approval, because those aren't just bookkeeping transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.704" offset="7966177">A carrier may have bare stock control of another carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.746" offset="7986343">It can do certain things under the applicable corporation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.393" offset="8000972">If it requires a two-thirds stock control, it can do more drastic things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.135" offset="8027930">In United States v. Marshall Transport, decided by this Court in 1944, a non-carrier already controlled a carrier and that carrier then acquired the properties of another carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.124" offset="8103894">This Court held that that transaction simultaneously involved an acquisition of control by the non-carrier parent of the latter carrier of the acquired carrier and that the non-carrier parent must seek and obtain the Commission's approval of such an indirect acquisition of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.110" offset="8203786">Since the Marshall Transport case in 1944, the Commission has held in several cases that a non-carrier parent must obtain approval under Section 5 (2) for the modification of its existing control of subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.128" offset="8275884">And I'd like to get two examples of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.750" offset="8286333">One, a small case involving motor carriers, the Commission held that upon a merger of two carriers controlled by an individual, that that individual must join in the application and seek and obtain the Commission's approval for his modification -- for the -- the modification of his control over the two carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.667" offset="8378075">Then, in a larger case, in 1947, the Pere Marquette merger, the Commission authorized under section 5 (2) the merger of the properties of the Pere Marquette Railroad into Chesapeake in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.746" offset="8438366">Now, Chesapeake in Ohio already had stock control of Pere Marquette.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.570" offset="8465638">And at the same time, the Commission found that Alleghany's acquisition of control through its existing control at Chesapeake in Ohio of the properties of Pere Marquette through that merger of Pere Marquette into Chesapeake in Ohio was a transaction which came within the scope of section 5 (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.305" offset="8556544">Now, we submit then in -- in this case the Commission did substantially the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.361" offset="8584861">It held that section 5 (2) required its approval of the change or modification of Alleghany's control of the Bridge Company properties which resulted from the double transaction of the merger of the Bridge Company properties and the Big Four, and the simultaneous lease of the -- of the Bridge Company properties by Big Four to New York Central which was directly controlled by -- by Alleghany.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.973" offset="8691231">And we think that that construction of section 5 is necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.408" offset="8717040">That purpose shows not only in the broad sweep of section 5, but in a legislative history equally sweeping in purpose, a purpose to place the entire process of carrier consolidation and unification under public regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.279" offset="8788511">And as a practical matter, contrary to the view to the court below, this increases or modifications of control can involve a good deal more than intra-system bookkeeping and the Pere -- Pere Marquette merger is an example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.972" offset="8855280">An increase in the stock control of a carrier may enable its direct or indirect non-carrier parents to bring about corporate actions which a lesser form of control would not permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.723" offset="8918288">The merger of a carrier previously controlled by a stock ownership signals the end of the possibility of independent operation of that carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.031" offset="8963532">And in the history of Alleghany, this is rather a dramatic illustration of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.788" offset="8978474">Some years ago, Alleghany controlled C &amp; O, Pere Marquette, and Nickel Plate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.049" offset="9011597">Through the years, different factors, economic factors, Pere Marquette was merged in the C &amp; O.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.162" offset="9040018">Nickel Plate on the other hand has become a completely independent carrier competing vigorously with C &amp; O.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.346" offset="9088711">At the same time, such mergers, such -- such rearrangements of a system will often signal a change in -- in the management or in the policies of a holding company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.282" offset="9148479">Such a change as would warrant the Commission for the first time in subjecting such a non-carrier parent to partial regulation as a carrier under section 5 (3), particularly with respect to security issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="2874.546" offset="11601586">Now, the District Court also held that the Commission's status order, so-called in the Bridge Case was invalid because the Commission had not authorized Alleghany's acquisition of control of New York Central as consistent with the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.215" offset="11660204">I will state that Alleghany did seek or obtain the Commission's approval of its acquisition of control of New York Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.920" offset="11691029">The Commission found and this is at page 511 of the record that the New York Central Railroad Company is the parent company of the New York Central Railroad System, comprised of numerous carriers including several railroad systems and the railroads and properties controlled and operated by those companies under lease or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.596" offset="11765739">When Allegany by stock ownership and by the favorable action of the stock holders obtained control of Central, all the properties within the carriers of it, rather long established single operating control and the Commission concluded that since Alleghany was recognized as a single established system, that since Central was recognized as a single established system, Alleghany's acquisition of control of Central did not constitute an acquisition of control of two or more carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.939" offset="11891127">Now, the District Court held squarely to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.139" offset="11903979">It held that where a non-carrier acquires control of the parent corporation of a railroad system, it acquires control of the subsidiaries and consequently of two or more carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.941" offset="11955179">Now, this -- this presents we think a very important jurisdictional question under the Act, because section 5 (2) expressly permits a non-carrier, holding company or otherwise to acquire control of a single carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.115" offset="12011813">It's only the acquisition of control of two or more carriers by a non-carrier which requires the Commission's approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.157" offset="12047966">Now, as practical matter, many railroads and I would not know how many motor carriers consist of a parent and subsidiary corporations whose properties are integrated for operating purposes through leases and similar arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.853" offset="12118810">On the other hand, some carriers for tax purposes or as the result of recent reorganization proceedings have eliminated such -- such subsidiaries and hold all their properties in the ownership of a single corporate entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.043" offset="12171577">But either way, it seems to us that Congress and everybody else regard New Haven, for example or Delaware &amp;Hudson as a single carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.025" offset="12211493">But under the decision below, every acquisition of control of a single integrated carrier enterprise consisting of two or more corporations would require approval under section 5 (2) and that jurisdiction would vary depending upon the internal organization arrangements of a particular carrier enterprise whether it operated through operating subsidiaries or whether its operations were organized in terms of unincorporated operating divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.994" offset="12331342">And in its report, the Commission also pointed out the practical problems that would arise if the Commission's approval was required for every acquisition of control of a carrier consisting of a parent company and one or more subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.119" offset="12383796">For example, in recent years, there have been successful practicing struggles for the acquisition of control over such carriers as Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis and the New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.399" offset="12428936">The Commission does not believe that Congress intended it to determine either before or after such proxy contest whether a particular person or identified group of persons should be allowed to control and operate a carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.083" offset="12499675">With it, Congress made it very clear that it intended the Commission to determine who could or could not control a carrier, only where there was involved the acquisition of control of two or more carriers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3687.161" offset="14852054">Particularly, as Judge, -- as Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out in his granting of a stay, where 97.5% of the voting, stockholder of that same class approved the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.444" offset="14901164">And that it seems to me that on that basis alone, this failure to consider hardship except to admit it, because they all did, I --I can read to Your Honor, briefly from the opinions of -- of several of the judges, Mr Judge Dimock of the District Court when he considered this problem and considered the stay, used this language.</text>

            <text syncTime="4228.189" offset="17016142">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4234.853" offset="17042787">There are seven parties before the Court on these appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4239.858" offset="17062849">Alleghany Corporation controlled by Mr. Young and his Chairman and Mr. Kirby, its president.</text>
            <text syncTime="4248.317" offset="17096600">Adelaide Neuwirth, represented by Mr. Kahan who just spoke, who was a common stockholder but who does not appeal from the jurisdictional questions involved in the judgement below, who merely appeals from the injunctive provisions of the judgement and who took no active part in the proceedings below.</text>
            <text syncTime="4269.141" offset="17179982">And there is the one preferred stockholder represented by Mr. Levin, Gruss &amp;Company, a New York Stock exchange firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.366" offset="17212792">We have the Interstate Commerce Commission who identifies with Alleghany in this case, except on the question of standing to sue and except as to the laws of Alleghany's carrier status on January 19, 1954, in which respects, it identifies with our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.780" offset="17282487">We have the Securities and Exchange Commission which has supported the appellees in this case on all investment company aspects of the case, as set forth in its brief amicus.</text>
            <text syncTime="4306.984" offset="17331284">And the United States who did not appeal from the judgement below, who instead has filed a brief here in which it has confessed error.</text>
            <text syncTime="4316.060" offset="17367646">May I read briefly from the Government brief at page 18 in which it sets its position for?</text>
            <text syncTime="4323.924" offset="17399097">In the District Court, the United States supported the I.C.C. in defending its orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="4332.165" offset="17432012">However, upon for the study of the issues and upon consideration of the Court's opinions, the United States has concluded that the District Court correctly held (1) That Alleghany did not acquire control under section 5 (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act of the Bridge Company through the merger of the latter with the Big Four.</text>
            <text syncTime="4353.587" offset="17517693">And that the I.C.C. therefore had urged in subjecting Alleghany to carrier status.</text>
            <text syncTime="4359.425" offset="17541099">And (2), that 1945 status order was terminated by this order in the merger proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4366.749" offset="17570356">Under this view, the I.C.C. orders authorizing the preferred stock issue were invalid for lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.168" offset="17612048">And then finally, we have the three common stockholders whom I represent and who for two long years and if I may be permitted to say so, quite along have raised the question of the nullity of the Interstate Commerce Commission's orders and the importance in the public interest of Alleghany registration and its subjection to the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission, propositions now supported both by the United States and by the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="4410.056" offset="17743600">They sue not only in their own right as stockholders, but in the right of the entire class.</text>
            <text syncTime="4418.822" offset="17778709">Now, this appeal is from a unanimous judgement of the three-judge Court, including the late Judge Frank, Judge Dimock and Judge Walsh.</text>
            <text syncTime="4428.878" offset="17818833">The court below decided five substantive questions and every one of them was resolved in favor of the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4437.838" offset="17854673">But actually, a finding on anyone of them will dispose of this appeal and require affirmance of the judgement below.</text>
            <text syncTime="4447.188" offset="17892080">The decision of the court below was synthesized in two or three sentences which I take the liberty of reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="4457.564" offset="17933667">Quoting, “We believe that the I.C.C. had no appropriate application before it for a determination of the question of the control.</text>
            <text syncTime="4466.764" offset="17970448">The case cannot therefore be remanded for such a determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4472.070" offset="17991659">The I.C.C.'s orders purported to determine the question of control of Central, but that determination cannot stand, (A) because the findings as to Alleghany's control of Central are insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="4483.980" offset="18039306">(b) Because the evidence does not support this findings and (C) because plaintiffs were deprived of an evidentiary hearing on that issue of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="4493.845" offset="18078804">There was one other substantive issue in the case, which has been the subject of colloquy between Court and counsel in the argument that proceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="4502.027" offset="18111509">And that was whether the merger was authorized, of whether -- whether the merger authorized I.C.C.jurisdiction or provided the basis for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4511.077" offset="18147662">And concerning that question, the Court said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4515.214" offset="18164276">Quote, "But where as the instant case the non-carrier Alleghany is according to our assumption arguendo already in indirect control of such property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4526.119" offset="18207848">No acquisition by the non-carrier results from the merger.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4530.132" offset="18223940">This seems to us the plain, clear and obvious interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4536.321" offset="18248704">Now, at the threshold we're presented with the reviewability and standing to sue questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4541.056" offset="18267617">All the I.C.C.o rders reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4543.141" offset="18275976">Do we have standing to sue?</text>
            <text syncTime="4546.106" offset="18287783">The I.C.C. doesn't challenge our standing to sue and the United State agrees that we have standing to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4553.068" offset="18315682">The District Court held that the orders were reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4556.299" offset="18328534">It confirmed all right to challenge them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4558.918" offset="18339088">It pointed out that the orders had caused us direct and substantial injury, that our stock was threatened with dilution and if anything more were needed to point up the adversity of our position from that of Alleghany's, we have it in the Securities and Exchange Commission, decision of November 30, 1956, when by virtue of its findings of unfairness to the common stockholders and I shall demonstrate that that is in the record and that my statement is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4586.658" offset="18450056">Our position was both adverse to Alleghany and adverse to the preferred stockholders specifically, on that very question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4598.025" offset="18495509">The result of the I.C.C. order approving the preferred stock plan was to increase the dividend on the new -- new preferred stock from 5.5% to 6%.</text>
            <text syncTime="4609.924" offset="18543052">That directly hurt the common stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="4612.550" offset="18553605">In addition, the I.C.C. orders -- ordered the conversation ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="4617.642" offset="18573981">That is the number of shares which the -- which the new stock would command.</text>
            <text syncTime="4622.309" offset="18592580">The number of common stock shares which the new stock would command if the conversation rights were exercised and increase them from 34 to 47.</text>
            <text syncTime="4632.345" offset="18632704">And then, of course, in addition to section 18 (d) as the SEC found, bars the use of this call on the common stock by the preferred stockholders as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4643.056" offset="18675545">Although as we say it confirmed our right to sue, they were specific findings by the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="4648.382" offset="18696861">They are implicit in the judgement of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="4653.975" offset="18719222">According to Alleghany's view we have no remedy in any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4657.668" offset="18734059">They say that they argued in opposition to a motion that we made before Judge Walsh sitting as a single judge in a derivative action which our clients had started against Alleghany, that we were not entitled to a temporary injunction in that one-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4672.549" offset="18793618">And they succeeded in persuading Judge Walsh to deny the motion and Judge Walsh did so remitting us to our administrative remedies before the I.C.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="4681.503" offset="18829354">The nub of this decision was that we haven't exhausted our remedies there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.182" offset="18844087">Pursuant to the direction in his judgment we did go before the I.C.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="4690.845" offset="18866761">And these -- this judgment raises the orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4697.320" offset="18892675">Now, Your Honors, if we're wrong on every phase of this question of standing to sue we say that the judgment below stands as a judgment of a one-judge District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4706.287" offset="18928515">That is, the three-judge District Court may be -- the judgment may be considered as a one-judge court and that the -- contrary to what Alleghany argues in its brief, it was not necessary for us to join the directors in this case in order to have a sufficient complaint in law before the three-judge court, because that question is not reviewable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4729.311" offset="19020570">And secondly, its -- is -- the fact is that we sued individually and representatively and in neither situation were we required to join directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4739.860" offset="19062784">In other words, we had a right to seek an injunction against what we considered to be a -- a preferred stock plan that was inequitable and unfair to us and that was being promulgated pursuant to avoid I.C.C. order.</text>

            <text syncTime="4904.452" offset="19721174">Was the District Court powerless merely because it was an Urgent Deficiencies Act Court, to maintain the status quo -- quo by an appropriate injunction?</text>

            <text syncTime="4942.473" offset="19873311">Now, was the District Court -- was the District Court bound to consider equities inuring to the appellate, solely by virtue of the disruption of the status quo?</text>
            <text syncTime="4950.545" offset="19905599">That question is also presented in its proper focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="4954.474" offset="19921272">Now, Your Honor, this is the chronology of events which preceded the disruption of the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="4959.873" offset="19942902">This is what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="4961.477" offset="19949275">On June 2nd, 1955, the appellees filed a petition for reconsideration of Division 4's order approving the preferred stock plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4972.499" offset="19993370">It requested the full commission to stay in adverse order if it made one for a reasonable time so that we could go to the District Court and get an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.576" offset="20037674">On June 6th, 1955, we commenced this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4990.208" offset="20064214">And a few days later, on June 15th, 1955, we moved for a preliminary injunction, returned it on June 23rd.</text>
            <text syncTime="4998.470" offset="20097233">We didn't ask for any temporary restraining order, because we considered it inconceivable that Alleghany would be advised to issue its stock, while our motion for a preliminary injunction was sub iudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5011.229" offset="20148328">On June 21st, Alleghany's counsel moved for leave to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="5018.953" offset="20179153">And in their papers, they admit notice of our application for a temporary injunction, although the papers had not been served upon because they were not then in the case, the defendants being merely the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="5033.005" offset="20235368">On this -- on the same day, contrary to what has been suggested here, the Government and the I.C.C. joined in an application to the District Court to adjoin the motion for a temporary injunctions until June 30th, but no one told the District Court that on the following day an order would come down from the Interstate Commerce Commission which would permit Alleghany, if it so desire, to issue the stock, because there was then no temporary restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5069.870" offset="20382804">And on the following day within less than 20 hours after the application for the adjournment was made to the District Court, the order did come down.</text>
            <text syncTime="5078.485" offset="20417285">And that order reached the possession of the Alleghany's counsel on -- at -- in Washington on noon of June 23rd.</text>
            <text syncTime="5087.325" offset="20452707">At 4:30 that afternoon, I was telephoned by Alleghany's counsel and told that the full commission had approved this preferred stock plan and that the issuance and distribution of the stock was actually under way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.638" offset="20525955">In less than an hour, I prepared an application for a temporary restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5110.234" offset="20544345">I submitted it to Judge Dimock and at 5:55 that evening, he signed it and it brought to a halt the further issuance and distribution of these securities, leaving 876,000 shares, distributed to the extent that they were in the hands of the original, old preferred stockholders and that is a crucially important distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5134.188" offset="20640162">468,000 were left undistributed and the persons entitled to those merely held receipts for their old securities, which -- but for the temporary restraining order, they could have presented and claimed their new securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5150.428" offset="20705050">So that the result of the temporary restraining order was to leave these securities frozen through, but frozen in the hands of the original holdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5160.238" offset="20744338">And they never reached the stream of commerce and they never went to a single person who could truthfully say that he was without notice of the infirmities in the Commission's jurisdiction and I shall develop that point in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5174.442" offset="20801181">Now, in this manner, Your Honors, Alleghany deliberately disrupted the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="5179.820" offset="20822601">It could have waited for six or seven days, until there was an argument on this motion for a temporary injunction on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="5186.289" offset="20848515">It could have urged all its grounds for opposition at that time, but not -- notwithstanding, it elected despite the pendency of the motion to go forward and to create this (Inaudible) common plea from which we have these anguished cries of innocence made here in the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5206.270" offset="20928449">Now, when questioned by the District Court on the following day when a motion to vacate the temporary restraining order was made as to why the order couldn't be relaxed in such a way so as to give those new preferred stockholders an opportunity to exchange their securities and get back the ones that they had given up, which were valid securities and were being traded on the market and which they could turn into cash if they wanted to sell them, Alleghany counsel said, I quote him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5231.540" offset="21029491">“But the thing having gone forward, we cannot unscramble it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5236.791" offset="21050493">And counsel for Gruss &amp; Company then later took a similar position.</text>
            <text syncTime="5244.459" offset="21081213">There never was -- there never was a disassociation by the preferred stockholders from that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="5252.467" offset="21113292">Now, getting to the question of the innocence of these preferred stockholders, because that nub of the question insofar as the equities are concerned assuming that they are entitled to raise any questions of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5265.047" offset="21163551">The preferred stockholders say they're innocent and Alleghany as Judge Dimock found attempts to hide behind them, because if the preferred stockholders present -- prevail the Alleghany position is rectified and they can get the benefit of any relief that is given to the preferred stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="5283.906" offset="21238993">These preferred stockholders are not naïve, are not innocent in the sense of -- we use that word as far as naïve or ordinary civilian traders in the stock market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5296.957" offset="21291238">They are hardcore.</text>
            <text syncTime="5297.976" offset="21295313">They are referred to as hardcore, recalcitrant preferred stockholders who have resisted in the past every (Inaudible) to persuade them to exchange their securities when prior conversion plans were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5309.665" offset="21342020">This is found by the SEC in the hearings before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5313.933" offset="21359156">And the ones, the preferred stockholders before the Court are the professionals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5317.983" offset="21375352">I don't mean that in an invidious sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5319.811" offset="21382666">I merely say that they are sophisticated persons who had full knowledge of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5325.167" offset="21404087">They are stock exchange brokers, and traders.</text>
            <text syncTime="5328.934" offset="21419133">They knew on February 10th, when this preferred stock plan was published that they had in their pockets, those of them who bought their securities, just before the plan was approved by the Alleghany directors, a profit of $170.000 a share at a -- at a maximum cost to them of $178 a share.</text>
            <text syncTime="5348.340" offset="21496769">In other words, it was then $170 profit developed in the six months period that transpired between the Alleghany approval of the preferred stock plan and the day that the I.C.C. finally approved it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5396.340" offset="21688717">Now, the Alleghany -- the preferred stockholders knew that there was as a -- a precondition to the effectiveness of the I.C.C.approved preferred stock plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5411.053" offset="21747545">They had notice of attacks on the I.C.C. jurisdiction and they had it in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5416.372" offset="21768861">When they became parties, contractual parties to the preferred stock plan, they signed a letter of transmittal in which it affirmatively appeared on the face of the letter that they were assuming all of the obligations and conditions of the -- of the exchange offer and from which, it appeared that they were bound by the terms and provision of that offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5438.357" offset="21856841">They were less contractually integrated into the plan and they thus had notice of whatever infirmities existed in the plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="5692.915" offset="22874990">My best answer to that observation is to quote from what Alleghany's counsel said on the final hearing before the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="5719.900" offset="22982928">That was quite an extraordinary and candid statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5723.364" offset="22996825">May I ask this court, what else could the District Court have done faced with a threat from Alleghany's counsel, that unless it acted, Alleghany would move forward and put the securities out, even though there had been a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction and the District Court was about to hand down its judgment affirming the views of the court -- of the District Court thus far.</text>
            <text syncTime="5746.664" offset="23090030">We say that the injunction is needed to preserve the status quo and we urge to this Court to protect the common stockholders and indeed Alleghany Corporation itself from the consequences of lifting the injunction, because the chaos involving the multiplicity of suits which would result, if this -- these securities should go forward into the stream of commerce would hurt everyone.</text>

            <text syncTime="5787.831" offset="23254706">And under the -- under the -- the holdings that began with Porter against Warner in other cases, the District Court has jurisdiction to restore the status quo ante even it means bringing in before the Court persons who were not originally parties to it, such as non-intervening preferred stockholders, who might want to be heard when it came time to adjust the equities.</text>

            <text syncTime="6361.318" offset="25548675">Now, it's been said that -- that when we said that Mr. Young and Mr. Kirby made a profit of a $4,800,000 as a result of this preferred stock issued and that profit personal that those facts are not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6378.701" offset="25618160">May I make a very brief demonstration that they offer?</text>
            <text syncTime="6383.097" offset="25635715">Alleghany supplied these facts and the I.C.C. elucidated them to some extent in its report.</text>
            <text syncTime="6391.772" offset="25670510">And from those reports, record 306, record 309, record 522, it appears that the range of this preferred stock was two and three-eights to $170 over a period 20 years and the $170 price was reached on -- on the eve of approval by the Alleghany directors of the preferred stock plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="6416.077" offset="25767685">Now, during this -- during the period that immediately preceded the Alleghany Director's approval of the plan, Young and Kirby accumulated 20% of these securities for themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="6426.798" offset="25810526">That's at record 309, and 522.</text>
            <text syncTime="6429.650" offset="25822020">That amounted to $27,784 shares.</text>

            <text syncTime="6441.351" offset="25868727">Now, all of this accumulation occurred during the period leading up to corporate action taken by Alleghany to put out the exchange offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="6450.430" offset="25905089">On June 15th, 1955, seven days before the I.C.C. approved the plan, the market had risen on a when-issued basis, the market on the old securities had -- had had risen on a -- from $170 of share to $348.75 a share.</text>

            <text syncTime="6474.878" offset="26002892">So that the minimum profit, assuming that Young and Kirby bought their stock at $170 a share, the highest prize we actually -- they must have bought it at a lower price, but giving them the benefit of a doubt in saying that they bought it $170 a share, the minimum profit was $178 a share and a $178 times 27,784 is $4,943,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="6497.977" offset="26095261">So that actually, we understated the profit by $143,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="6505.346" offset="26124727">Now, I turn to the subsequent question of whether Alleghany does in fact control Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="6521.445" offset="26189197">The Interstate Commerce Commission, by its findings and they're the only findings of control in this case, found that Alleghany acquired control of Central on May 26th, 1954 as a result of a proxy contest in connection with the New York Central proxy campaign of 1955 or 1954, I beg pardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="6543.544" offset="26277595">The same findings do not disclose that on that very same control date, May 26, 1954, there was 6,000,446,000 shares of New York Central Stock outstanding that Young, Kirby and Richardson, their associates, personally owned a million shares of New York Central Stock at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6565.933" offset="26367143">And that the total value of Alleghany's holdings which were limited to 11,400 shares was only $270,000 whereas the total value of the four individual holdings in Central was $23,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="6580.693" offset="26426180">We say that the I.C.C. control findings were insufficient, that they were unsupported.</text>
            <text syncTime="6586.133" offset="26447914">Division 4 held to that effect and the District Court so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="6593.959" offset="26479156">But, Your Honors, if there be any question about whether there -- or not, there was control by Alleghany of New York Central on May 26, 1954, this crucial event which preceded it will dispel that doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="6609.067" offset="26539656">On January 19th, 1954, the day that Alleghany divested itself of control of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad System, in order to prepare the way for its -- for Young and Kirby's attempt to take control of New York Central the minutes of the board meeting held that day contained the following statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6628.360" offset="26616769">This was an -- a statement made after a recommendation that Alleghany divest itself of control of the C &amp; O.</text>
            <text syncTime="6634.212" offset="26640175">I quote “The Chairman, Mr. Young, stated his personal opinion that substantial investment by this Corporation, Alleghany in Central at this time was not wise, because it was not clear whether control could be obtained and because control could perhaps be more easily secured by individuals than by a corporation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6660.112" offset="26743829">Now, I must admit that 169 -- once -- that that's found at record 179, I must admit that that record of fact was not before the Interstate Commerce Commission during the pendency of the administrative proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="6676.944" offset="26811120">It was brought out at the final hearing before the District Court in opposition to a motion by Alleghany for a new trial, but it does pose this question and that is, what kind of investigation did the I.C.C. make?</text>
            <text syncTime="6689.776" offset="26862425">It had Alleghany's records at its disposal and it is unthinkable that having made any kind of investigation, if it did, that it would have stopped short of taking a look at the minutes of the meeting of the -- of directors that which Alleghany divested itself of control of the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railroad System.</text>
            <text syncTime="6707.481" offset="26933269">And it would have observed, had it made that inquiry that the Directors themselves were saying to Mr. Young and Mr. Kirby, “Go your own way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6715.196" offset="26964198">Take control in your own names, but it is not propitious for us to do so.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6722.219" offset="26992201">There is no corporate minute or corporate record of any kind in this record, showing that the Directors contemplated that Alleghany would attempt to take control of New York Central.</text>
            <text syncTime="6735.764" offset="27046431">And there is no authority that we know of, corporate-wise for any such attempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="6741.121" offset="27067852">Now, instead of -- it's resting on record facts the I.C.C. rested its findings on Alleghany's application, solely on Alleghany's application and the I.C.C. brief so discloses.</text>
            <text syncTime="6751.358" offset="27108812">And the Alleghany's application was signed by its Public Relations Officer, Mr. (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="6756.367" offset="27128874">Mr. Kirby and Mr. Young would not lend their names to that application.</text>
            <text syncTime="6762.653" offset="27153951">Now, the fact is that New York Central Directors were not chosen by Alleghany.</text>
            <text syncTime="6767.786" offset="27174536">The I.C.C. found that they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="6770.629" offset="27185925">Reading from the New York Central proxy statement signed by Mr. Young on half of quote, “Alleghany, Young, Kirby Ownership Board,” a -- a device to make it appear that Alleghany was actually seeking control when its corporate record indicated to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="6788.495" offset="27257396">This is what the proxy statement said, “If Alleghany will furnish a clearing house and clerical headquarters and advance the interim costs of our solicitation for which it will be proportionately reimbursed by our nominees.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6802.401" offset="27312985">That was to give coloration for the application which Alleghany intended to make on September 20, 1954 and which is to provide the basis if any exists, for I.C.C.'s jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="6864.606" offset="27561775">The other 12 had no connection with Alleghany.</text>
