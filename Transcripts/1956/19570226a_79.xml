            <text syncTime="33.769" offset="238425">If the Court please, this case comes here on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin to review a judgment of that Court which restrains the petitioners from peaceful picketing at the place of employment of nonunion workingmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.538" offset="325569">Litigation was initiated in the Circuit Court for Waukesha County which entered ex parte temporary and permanent injunctions against such picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.316" offset="368619">On appeal to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, it, first, rendered the decision, in which unanimously held, that the lower court was in error and reversed the lower court with directions to dissolve the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.014" offset="427447">Upon motion for rehearing and after re-argument, some seven months later, the Court reversed itself and, by a vote of six-to-one, reinstated the permanent injunction, holding that it was in error in its first opinion when it directed the lower court to dissolve it.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Previant</label>
            <text syncTime="101.257" offset="508426">On motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.321" offset="516681">The case presents the question whether such peaceful picketing at the place of employment of nonunion employees, unaccompanied by any demand upon the employer and preceded only by a solicitation of the nonunion employees, is protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution or whether, as the court below found that such picketing was engaged in for the unlawful purpose of compelling the employer, through economic coercion, to interfere with the rights of his employees not to join a union in violation of the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.337" offset="696717">The evidentiary facts are simple and they are undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.206" offset="720227">The employer operates a place of business in a gravel pit in the Town of Oconomowoc, County of Waukesha in the State of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.159" offset="764008">In its operations, it employees from some 10 to 15 employees, all of whom are eligible for membership in either of the three unions which are the petitioners here.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.146" offset="827956">In August of 1953 and again in April of 1954, the petitioning unions solicited directly the membership of these nonunion employees, discussed with them the advantages of organization, but their invitation was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.385" offset="920952">Now, there is some statement in respondent's brief that this solicitation occurred over a period of 12 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.962" offset="943208">The record does not so show it, but we believe it is immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.461" offset="961181">After the refusal of the employees and, again, without any approach ever having been made to the employer, without any demand ever having been made upon the employer, the petitioners commenced picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.061" offset="1023666">They picketed at the site of the gravel pit on a public road immediately adjoining the gravel pit where the employer maintained his place of business and where the nonunion employees were working.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.639" offset="1085942">The sign which they displayed carried the very simple and truthful legend that the men on the job were not 100% affiliated with the American Federation of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.738" offset="1142366">And, the sign was signed by the three unions involved, the Building and Construction Labor's Union, the Operating Engineers' Union and the Teamsters Union and, that is, the local unions of those organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.499" offset="1205373">There is no proof with respect to the extent of the traffic which used the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.046" offset="1227525">There was no proof with the extent to the number of customers which might come to that particular job site to transact business with the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.893" offset="1266918">The picketing was completely peaceful and completely orderly.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.903" offset="1286980">There was no obstruction of any kind, no threats, and no violence.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_previant" startTime="302.689" stopTime="603.547">
            <label>Mr. David Previant</label>
            <text syncTime="302.689" offset="1314147">Two or three, sometimes one.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.511" offset="1325432">The record is -- I don't believe that there's even a reference in the record to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.880" offset="1342882">It may be, if there is, that there were one.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.936" offset="1351137">But, there was no mass picketing, no finding of mass picketing of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.651" offset="1374020">Now, some truck drivers of material suppliers to this place of business refused to go through that picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.618" offset="1409860">In consequence of which, the employer used his own trucks with which to pick up the materials which had been or would have been delivered by these other truck drivers who did not go through the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.256" offset="1476420">He did sustain inconvenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.800" offset="1486555">He sustained expense and he sustained damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.004" offset="1499408">When I say “he,” I speak of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.535" offset="1513514">Now, all of these facts were alleged by the employer and they were admitted procedurally by the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.033" offset="1559489">I say, therefore, there is no undisputed evidentiary fact in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.199" offset="1584149">When respondent says that there is some dispute, respondent refers to the allegation, also contained in the bill of complaint, that the picketing was unlawful because it was indulged in or engaged in for the purpose of coercing the employer to coerce the employees in the exercise of the right not to join a union and, therefore, to coerce him in violation of state law and, therefore, the picketing was unlawfully purposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.669" offset="1710059">It was also charged that the picketing was unlawful per se because of the existence in the State of Wisconsin of a statute which defines a labor dispute as a controversy over wages and working conditions between an employer and a majority of his employees and a further statute which says that unless there is a labor dispute as so defined, picketing is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.841" offset="1818728">The Union denied the unlawful purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.601" offset="1833775">The Union asserted that the wages and working conditions of these employees were less than those which prevailed in union contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.241" offset="1872332">They asserted the desirability of inducing these employees to join their union for the purpose of protecting their standards, and they asserted the unconstitutionality of the Wisconsin statute which was invoked defining a labor dispute and prohibiting picketing unless pursuant to a dispute so defined and asserted also that any restraining order or injunction which might be entered under these factual circumstances would deprive them of their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment conjoined with the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.516" offset="1997406">In the circuit court, or what would ordinarily be the trial court, in view of the allegations of the complaint and the admissions of the petitioners here, there was no evidence taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.433" offset="2057070">The Court made its decision based upon those uncontroverted facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.520" offset="2077445">It found, number one, that there was no unlawful purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.466" offset="2101269">It found, number two, that there was a purpose to organize the employees who did not belong to the union, said, as a matter of fact, to induce the plaintiff's employees to organize and affiliate with the unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.035" offset="2167515">It found that to be the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.581" offset="2177651">However, it felt that it was bound by the Wisconsin statutory scheme of prohibiting picketing unless the picketing was pursuant to a dispute between a majority of the employees and the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.534" offset="2245465">So, it found the picketing unlawful, under the statute which I've alluded to, and entered a temporary injunction restraining the picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.639" offset="2285902">The parties there upon stipulated that the record contained all of the facts that would be adduced in Court on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.498" offset="2321324">And, on such stipulation, the Court then entered its permanent injunction making, again, the same findings of facts and the same conclusions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.778" offset="2374510">From that point, the unions took an appeal to the Wisconsin Supreme Court and because the holding of the Wisconsin Supreme Court initially is pertinent to these proceedings with the leave of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.125" offset="2431875">I would like to quote this one flat unequivocal finding of the Wisconsin Court in the first decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.967" offset="2463222">The Court said, “The testimony would not have supported a finding of the facts constituting a violation of either of the subsections.”</text>

            <text syncTime="671.573" offset="2789648">There was no violence, no force, no threat of force, no disorder, or physical destruction to plaintiff's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.256" offset="2820368">There was no evidence that defendant's representatives had coerced or intimidated any of plaintiff's employees in the right to join or refuse to join either of the defendant unions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1069.360" offset="4380818">On rehearing, however, without the -- without any further facts, without any further evidence, and without referring to any further acts, the Court concluded that it was in error in making its initial finding that the record would not support a finding of unlawful purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.033" offset="4467545">It said it had given insufficient consideration to other rights which might be involved in the situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1107.987" offset="4535359">It concluded that the Union hoped that the picketing would interfere with the business of the employer and, thus, bring pressure upon the employer to coerce the employees to join the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.988" offset="4587290">It concluded that the message of the banner could not have been of any enlightenment to the employees because the employees had already been solicited and were aware of the fact that the Union wanted them to join.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.008" offset="4635355">It concluded that, since the picketing was on a country road and business was patronized by only a small number of customers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1279.685" offset="5222066">Those limited aspects, under the decisions of this Court, were that picketing which is enmeshed with violence or in a background of violence could be restrained, or that picketing a place which has no economic connection with the area of the dispute could be restrained, or that picketing to compel the violation of a valid state policy could be restrained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.226" offset="5316315">This Court did make it clear, however, that picketing to -- could not be restrained merely based upon the State's notion of what is a labor dispute or trying to establish artificial bounds to a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.422" offset="5381099">Actually, this case involves that series of cases in which this Court held that picketing to compel a violation of the valid state policy may be regulated or restrained by the State regardless of whether that state policy is announced by the judiciary or by the legislative branch of the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="3211.912" offset="12951071">And, I should like -- what I think of it, Mr. Justice Brennan, to say to you that the Court -- the Wisconsin Supreme Court which determined that it had the power to make findings of its own on a record of this kind, where there was no oral testimony, did find in effect that one of the purposes of the picketing was to cut off the transportation facilities of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.544" offset="13093595">I may call your attention to page 35 of the transcript on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.793" offset="13130585">In the middle of the page, the Court says, this is its second opinion, “the question then arises whether the defendants violated Section 111.06 (2)(m) of the statute and, thereby, engaged in picketing for an unlawful purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.071" offset="13203623">The trial court refused to find as plaintiff requested that the picketing on plaintiff's premises had been engaged in for the purpose of coercing, and so forth, to become members of the defendant labor organization and for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff in his business of his refusal to, in anyway, interfere with the rights of his employees to join or not to join a labor organization.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.151" offset="13303933">They go on to say here, “We are of the opinion that the finding should have been made picketing may be more than free speech when it is conducted as it was in this instance, upon a rural highway at the entrance to a gravel pit for an exceedingly small number of possible or probable patrons of the owner's business might pass and be influenced by the Union's banner.</text>

            <text syncTime="3625.063" offset="14603577">We have concluded that we were in error in our original determination of the issues in this case and, therefore, withdraw the opinion on the mandate previously entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.832" offset="14642657">We are convinced that, in our study of the issues presented, we gave too little consideration to the fact that there are limitations upon the right of free speech and that the prohibition of action against free speech is not intended to give immunity for every use or abuse of language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.051" offset="14715591">We gave him sufficient notice to the fact that free speech is not the only right secured by our fundamental law and that it must weighed here, for instance, against the equally important right to engage in a legitimate business, free from dictation by an outside group of the right to protection against unlawful conduct which will or may result in a destruction of a business, that both the right to labor and the right to carry on business are liberty in property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.783" offset="14834500">We left out of calculation the rule that the Court is to consider not only the established facts, as they appear in the record, but that it should also give attention to the inferences reasonably and justifiably to be drawn there from.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.171" offset="14896044">Now, in connection with that, I would like to point out to you in a sort of an itemized way the different elements that entered into the Court's conclusions and those are contained on page 49 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.155" offset="15007953">It sums up the bases, the factual bases upon which the Court came to this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.771" offset="15050480">The title of -- the title is the right to engage in a lawful business free from outside interference is also a constitutionally -- is constitutionally protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.389" offset="15092903">When the Supreme Court handed down its second opinion upon rehearing, it recited the following principles among others which, in part, have motivated it to reverse its first decision and to which it had previously given too little consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.347" offset="15156746">And, those are the facts which I call to Your Honor's attention to in the beginning of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.327" offset="15208678">There are some other considerations which commence with (e) on page 49 that, in considering the right of freedom of speech, it must be recognized that the right is to be evaluated with the right of the many who have no interest whatsoever in the relationship between the defendant union and those who may seek to acquire as members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.185" offset="15308152">That, by its very nature, every right is related to a duty to exercise so as to cause a minimum of harm to another, least of all to an innocent bystander, that the right of freedom of speech may not be considered a part from that of society to maintain order, that when one who seeks freedom -- that one who seeks freedom may not wholly ignore his neighbor's right to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.004" offset="15419434">Now, we have had quite a lot of controversy in the labor relations and in the legal actions that flow from them about recognition picketing and organizational picketing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3862.615" offset="15553808">Well, it was directed to that point as to whether or not there is a difference between picketing which results from a demand upon the employer to recognize it as a bargaining agent and picketing which is indulged in without any demand or communication between the Union and the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.693" offset="15674180">There has never --it has never seemed to me that there is any difference in that kind of an approach because the objectives, whether it is so-called recognition picketing or so-called organizational picketing, is the same, namely, to achieve a status whereby the Union gets the representation for the employees involved and proceeds along the normal lines of the sequence of Union representation to attempt to get some kind of a collective bargaining contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3930.255" offset="15824436">Now, what was the employer here, under the law of Wisconsin, up against, regardless of whether this was organizational picketing or recognition picketing?</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.352" offset="15868740">Our statutes provides, the Wisconsin Employment Peace Act which have been before this Court a good many times in other cases, that it shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer to bargain with the representatives of employees who do not represent the majority.</text>

            <text syncTime="4960.012" offset="19943424">I just want to press upon Your Honors, although I know the question of facts that is here, that the Wisconsin has never been a laggard in social and economic progress and in the progress of labor relations, legislation and judicial decisions which have for their purpose, generally speaking, of bringing about industrial peace and economic justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4996.100" offset="20087724">This Act says that labor relation constitute a three-way street, that they employ -- impose obligations and duties and confer privileges on employees, unions, and employers and, upon those two elements in labor relations, to serve the interest of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="5029.766" offset="20222412">And, I repeat again that the safeguard that is in that Labor Relations Act or in the Wisconsin Employment Peace Act is the fact that the right of the employee to choose to join a union or not to join a union is the whole keystone of the Act, and that any party to the labor relationship that, in any manner, tries to intimidate, coerce, induce, or force in any manner an employee to make a choice against his will is guilty of an unfair labor practice.</text>

          <turn speaker="david_previant" startTime="5083.688" stopTime="5205.945">
            <label>Mr. David Previant</label>
            <text syncTime="5083.688" offset="20438079">I'm addressing myself to the question asked from Mr. Chief Justice Warren.</text>
            <text syncTime="5089.346" offset="20460753">There was no allegation and there was no proof with respect to the number of people who travels on this county highway, this country road, or with respect to the number of customers that might be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.033" offset="20523551">It first arose in the Court's decision on the motion for rehearing and we, in a footnote to our brief, point out that there is no evidence to support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5115.501" offset="20565347">I think the case has been thoroughly canvassed.I just want to point out that there are other alternatives to an employer in this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="5125.043" offset="20603591">Many employers survive picketing very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="5128.784" offset="20618533">Many employers, in fact, increase their business on the patronage of those who, for some reason or other, are not sympathetic to the union's cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5137.297" offset="20652596">If any, this particular employer might increase his truck fleet to get his deliveries just on the money he may be saving by his employees not being members of the union and not drawing the union wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5149.761" offset="20702438">And, finally, although we have never ourselves believed that an employer should be anything but strictly neutral in these matters, this Court and the law have indicated that it is not beyond the possibility for an employer to sit down with his employees and to discuss with them, fully and frankly, both the advantages and the disadvantages of organization if he does not, in so doing, either make a promise of benefit to them in exchange for whatever action they may take or to threaten them with reprisal in exchange for whatever action it takes.So, we are not here confined, as the case might indicate, with solely the question that he has either got to yield or go out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="5189.342" offset="20860740">And, again, I say, the fact that an employer might be inclined to violate the law is applying a subjective test.</text>
            <text syncTime="5196.440" offset="20889161">It's applying a test of the effectiveness of the picket line and should not be used in determining whether or not a right which is of constitutional rank is unlawfully purposed or not.</text>

          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="5205.945" stopTime="5218.945">

            <text syncTime="5205.945" offset="20927195">May I say, I am cheered by the suggestion that, in Wisconsin, the atmosphere is such that that's a reasonable expectation on the part of the employer.</text>
