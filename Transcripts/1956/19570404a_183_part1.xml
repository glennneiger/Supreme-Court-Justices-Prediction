            <text syncTime="78.257" offset="416371">But although it is -- it is not necessary to review the evidence on the substantive issue of guilt, the nature of the conspiracy is important in determining the application of this statute of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="4139.990" offset="16663280">Now, Mr. Raffel takes the stand and he testifies and he said, “I never made the admission which the -- which the agent says I made.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.584" offset="16713749">And the question is, whether in this situation, it is proper to cross-examine him with respect to his prior inconsistent position at the first trial where he had failed to take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="4167.215" offset="16772263">The problem is -- is basically one of -- of waiver.</text>

            <text syncTime="4195.523" offset="16885426">For example, he can be cross-examined with respect to past criminal acts which pass -- which would -- would weigh on -- on the weight to be given to his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="4204.009" offset="16919385">If he has taken inconsistent positions with respect to the testimony he know gives in a prior trial that may be brought to the attention of the jury for the jury to weigh, to determine whether or not to believe what he is saying at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4219.233" offset="16980302">And the nub of this question, if I may say so, is whether or not the protection of -- given by the Fifth Amendment is such that some extra special protection should be given to his prior silence because he was silent on a constitutional ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="4241.723" offset="17070268">And I think that is really the question which is involved here whether he -- in order to give -- in order to protect and you give an additional -- that additional honor of -- of sanctity to his -- to his prior silence.</text>

            <text syncTime="4485.759" offset="18046412">Now, on direct examination, on cross-examination, not a word was asked or was said, nor was there a suggestion made that Halperin when he was before the grand jury had done anything else other than claim the amendment in language which would appear that the -- that it might tend to incriminate or degrade him.</text>

            <text syncTime="4661.114" offset="18747852">Your Honors can see then at page 685 that I made the same argument that I made before this Court that he was not a voluntary witness before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4676.249" offset="18808351">And so that it was distinguished from the Raffel case which is mentioned in the very argument that I made to the District Court, and where I said -- I said that the authority of the Raffel case has nothing to do with this situation there.</text>

            <text syncTime="4725.935" offset="19007091">I asked the Court and it's in the almost the very top of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="4732.462" offset="19033213">I said at this point, I would be -- I would like to be permitted under the United States against Remington which is a case up in our circuit to be permitted to see these witnesses for grand jury testimony at this very time when the direct examination was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4753.134" offset="19115865">The Court said, "Well, I'd probably be entitled to it, but I have to wait until the examination was finished."</text>

            <text syncTime="4769.065" offset="19179604">Well, the Court said, it since it's going to be adjourned in about 10 minutes, it -- it is impossible for me to finish because I said I wanted to finish my redirect on the subject realizing the impact on the jury of this raising of a claim of privilege by a defendant before a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4790.946" offset="19267166">Now, if you'll read on, the Court said it wouldn't be possible to give it to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.828" offset="19290676">They were going to adjourn in 10 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.397" offset="19300916">They were going to direct them that I'd be made available.</text>

            <text syncTime="4804.775" offset="19322441">And they said it was up to me if I didn't want to talk to my client about it, but I wanted the jury to know that I didn't want to talk to him about it because I knew that the grand jury testimony would disclose what as we now learn.</text>
            <text syncTime="4820.189" offset="19384090">And so, I -- the judge said to the -- says to the United States Attorney, “Give Mr. Singer a copy of it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.732" offset="19410317">He said he didn't have another copy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4829.285" offset="19420557">And so, we went on with the direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4833.463" offset="19437275">And I was -- there was -- a suggestion was made that I appear over his shoulder, and of course, I said I believe that he would read the questions and the answers properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4843.348" offset="19476773">And I know he did and, of course, I waited until the Court recess and then I got a few minutes, but I was never given a copy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4853.592" offset="19517733">And so, when I returned Monday morning, I proceeded to ask Mr. -- I then made my motion to dismiss on the very ground which forms the basis of this claim here that it was wrong to call the target of an investigation before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4874.618" offset="19601847">Up to that time, I'd the slightest notion in the world that they would ever question him about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4883.745" offset="19638314">But to continue with this other phase of it for a minute, if I may, I then learned because I had only -- well, as a matter of fact, the record will show at one point the assistant asked the defendant whether he had reported to me what he had said before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4904.705" offset="19722219">Whether he had made notes on it and given it to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="4907.346" offset="19732773">And it appears right in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4910.340" offset="19744684">However, when I got the grand jury minutes, I learned first that there was quite an argument of law between Mr. Halperin and the foreman of the grand jury and Mr. Kennedy who was the Assistant of United States Attorney and Mr. Parker who was President.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.843" offset="19810722">Look at page 705, and very rapidly, you will see right below the -- the asterisks in the center of the page and that's to grant my reading of part of the grand jury testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="4949.405" offset="19901001">Halperin told the grand jury that he could give them plenty of citations where the Court of Appeals of the State of New York, and I'm reading it, held that it was just as important and even more important for an innocent man to claim the privilege than it was for a guilty person.</text>
            <text syncTime="4970.057" offset="19983548">And the quotes would indicate that I was reading from the grand jury minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4974.852" offset="20002774">And the foreman replied to him, “These were state cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4979.394" offset="20020955">These are in federal cases.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.263" offset="20036420">Read right ahead in the very next answer to he next question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4988.648" offset="20057945">And then we find Mr. Kennedy or as the witness said he wasn't sure whether it was Mr. Parker saying, “I'm not disputing your right to claim the privilege, Mr. Halperin," if you go to the top of page 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="5004.742" offset="20122311">And Halperin said, "I know you're not planning my privilege and I regret that I'm compelled to take it as I've explained it to you."</text>
            <text syncTime="5016.891" offset="20170898">Now, I want you to go back and see how he was jockeyed before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5025.567" offset="20205589">He used the language as in he ended and the record shows at page 704 at the top of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="5033.745" offset="20238399">He used the language that I and then in behalf of the lawyer, I think should advise the client who was -- might claim the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="5042.323" offset="20272671">You said I -- an advise by my counsel and he mentioned my name but I must have declined to answer any questions under the Fifth Amendment which results in my furnishing evidence which could be used against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5059.060" offset="20339649">The United States Attorney wasn't satisfied with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5062.531" offset="20353546">And if you read 705, Mr. Parker says to him, it's in the record, he said, "Why not say I refused to answer on the ground that it might tend to incriminate or degrade you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5076.264" offset="20408404">It's short.</text>
            <text syncTime="5078.641" offset="20417912">Well, the witness, before the grand jury said, "All right, if that's what you want it probably means the same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="5709.560" offset="22941654">But that's what happens with court exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="5712.354" offset="22952835">But let's -- let's get -- I -- I will be on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5716.122" offset="22967881">Now, the Government's claim here is, why the grand jury knew nothing about Mr. Halperin.</text>
            <text syncTime="5723.961" offset="22999228">They didn't even know the name of Grunewald, the Washington associate, put at this very same time in the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5734.703" offset="23042173">And it was part of the trial itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5738.298" offset="23056593">It showed that Grunewald who was supposed to be and they've described him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5742.814" offset="23074670">Anyway, let's accept it for this purpose, the so-called Washington associate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5750.084" offset="23103718">His secretary, Ms. Hain was called before the grand jury and she testified and it's in the record and in my reply brief and in the Government's directly, that she was subpoenaed to Brooklyn while this Brooklyn grand jury was being -- the proceedings were there being conducted back in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="5772.930" offset="23195042">That she talked to the United States Attorney, to the special assistant, to the first assistant a Mr. (Inaudible) and some Government agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5785.104" offset="23243839">But beyond that and the record shows it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5789.839" offset="23262751">It appears right in the trial testimony when Mr. Halperin was called before the grand jury, the District Attorney was loaded, forebear.</text>
            <text syncTime="5801.450" offset="23309145">He had an idea in which it would -- it would have been perfectly proper that Halperin, a lawyer, would claim that since he was a lawyer, he couldn't divulge confidential communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="5818.459" offset="23377168">So, the assistant before the grand jury showed Halperin a paper which he said was a letter from the three Patullo defendants, the three Patullo plans wherein they waived the privilege, the relationship of the attorney claim so as to deprive Halperin of any claim he might have by way of privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="5852.860" offset="23514781">And now, to top it all, though, though it's not in the record and I know there'll be no denial of it, this very Washington associate, Grunewald, was called before the grand jury in Brooklyn.</text>
            <text syncTime="5866.973" offset="23571310">There were proceedings in connection with his illness to compel him to testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="5872.331" offset="23592730">There were long hearings before the Court and the whole thing is a lot of nonsense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5878.009" offset="23615404">It's a lot of expressions and words, which he used, as I say even today, to conceal the fact that there was no mystery before that grand jury that Halperin was a target.</text>
            <text syncTime="5892.402" offset="23672978">Now, let's say he wasn't the prime target.</text>
            <text syncTime="5895.622" offset="23685831">I don't know if I'm being shot at whether I care if they hit me in number five or number one on a target.</text>
            <text syncTime="5903.089" offset="23715715">I am there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5904.523" offset="23721462">And that's the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5906.442" offset="23729089">Now, let's see what happens when you do a thing like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5912.654" offset="23753958">You start off what might -- what might look like a very legitimate thing, subpoenaing a person before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5921.974" offset="23791261">But you know he's a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5924.138" offset="23799933">You know he's the person against whom, and the trial testimony discloses this fact that every single witness with the exception of Davis and Hoffman on cross-examination when I examined them said that they had told the grand jury in Brooklyn every single thing that they told the trial jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5954.242" offset="23920306">As a matter of fact, in some instances in an attempt to develop the inconsistency so that I could cross-examine and try to get the Brooklyn grand jury minutes, the judge himself read the Brooklyn grand jury minutes and made a statement that there was no inconsistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="5974.992" offset="24003375">So, that's proven conclusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="5977.282" offset="24012466">But second, now, let's take Davis and Hoffman.</text>
            <text syncTime="5980.615" offset="24025840">And this -- I might complain to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5983.918" offset="24039006">You refused to grant one of my questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5987.516" offset="24053426">You've been very kind in granting the others on a hypothetical question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5995.328" offset="24084668">Davis, at the stand -- now, he was the principal architect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5998.565" offset="24097625">That this is the man who was supposed to have really conducted this whole thing as I get this, as the trial seemed to show.</text>
            <text syncTime="6007.038" offset="24131480">He was the brains who figured out how to get the money and how to cheat the clients or whatever he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="6017.037" offset="24171499">He testified on redirect in an attempt to rehabilitate him after he'd been completely destroyed on cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="6028.386" offset="24216952">That long before the trial, back in 1952, he had disclosed in full all of these dealings with the Washington associates, would have been -- which would have been with Halperin or Bolich and Mr. Grunewald in a hypothetical statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6059.342" offset="24340773">What it meant, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="6060.861" offset="24346833">I never saw the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6065.059" offset="24363656">The Court permitted the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6067.295" offset="24372537">Of course, the statement wasn't offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="6069.640" offset="24381942">I objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="6071.559" offset="24389569">The Circuit Court said that it was a prior consistent statement and it was permitted in.</text>
            <text syncTime="6079.622" offset="24421857">But that, I'm willing to take that hypothetical statement as proof from the Government's own lips that that Brooklyn grand jury knew that Halperin was an -- a -- the prospective defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6093.608" offset="24477759">And now, to cut the climax, the Government comes up with a new one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6098.805" offset="24498552">It says, "Well, anyway the Brooklyn grand jury could never have indicted Halperin."</text>
            <text syncTime="6104.542" offset="24521540">Of course, there was no overt act committed in Brooklyn.</text>
            <text syncTime="6109.723" offset="24542229">Well, why did they have an investigation there?</text>
            <text syncTime="6112.952" offset="24555186">Why did they call people before grand juries in the district that has no jurisdiction?</text>
            <text syncTime="6118.644" offset="24577964">But again, and this is no forum of Mr. Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6123.311" offset="24596668">He forgets that this record shows that the income tax return in the Gotham Beef case was filed in Brooklyn.</text>
            <text syncTime="6136.596" offset="24649749">There's testimony in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6140.078" offset="24663646">And that the agents who investigated that -- this case was an agent from the Brooklyn office who had referred, not that it's important, because when we go to the question of due process, we must ultimately come to the old case of Counselman against Hitchcock where this Court said to call a prospective defendant or for a defendant before the grand jury was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="6172.848" offset="24794781">Next, in our own state court and I have cited the cases, they've held that to call a man before the grand jury who was a -- who was a prospective defendant vitiates the complete case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6195.858" offset="24886836">Now, Judge Medina in the Scully case in our circuit, and I think, Your Honors, denied certiorari in the matter, said in substance that he couldn't believe that this was something that was done so generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="6221.013" offset="24987460">But he said it was wrong and unethical in substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6225.371" offset="25004805">If I used the wrong adjective, I'll withdraw it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6230.187" offset="25024136">In substance, he said it was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="6233.939" offset="25039078">It was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="6236.108" offset="25047855">However, he said, "I hope no United States Attorney would do it."</text>
            <text syncTime="6241.444" offset="25069171">In this circuit recently, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said a the recent case, which we've cited in the Powell case, the Government cites it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6255.013" offset="25123401">That Mr. Powell was undoubtedly the target of the investigation but they reversed on another ground and that there was serious doubt as to why they should call it.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="6418.430" offset="25777089">I thought it's -- for me, important.</text>
            <text syncTime="6420.988" offset="25787329">As counsel for Halperin, departing from this question but relating to it, quite seriously.</text>
            <text syncTime="6427.722" offset="25814288">Assume you're right -- assume your right, does the testimony as to Halperin, is the testimony or the evidence in the record as to Halperin seriously or weightily or relevantly different from, in weight, from that to which supports the verdict of the other defendants?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Henry G. Singer</label>
            <text syncTime="6448.669" offset="25898088">Why don't we put it this way, Your Honor?</text>
            <text syncTime="6451.592" offset="25909791">There's no testimony as far as I can see it, direct testimony except through Halperin because under the factual proof, it would say that Halperin, who made the arrangement with Grunewald, although at one stage in the proceeding, another man, Davis, says he was present just while a word "okay" was said or there was no such proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="6479.945" offset="26023163">Or the whole thing was a swindle on the part of Davis to cheat his clients out of $160,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="6487.247" offset="26052315">And that's the whole thing and that's why Judge Frank said in his dissenting opinion that the jury could well reasonably have acquitted Halperin.</text>
            <text syncTime="6499.378" offset="26100903">Now, I have about eight or ten minutes and I would like to go to another subject, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="6506.462" offset="26129220">I might say to Your Honor, now -- before I finish And I'm not saying this just for words.</text>
            <text syncTime="6514.232" offset="26160253">This business of calling people before the grand jury and the question of the Fifth Amendment isn't new in our country and it's a little different in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="6526.604" offset="26209782">Judge Taft pointed that out in one case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6529.806" offset="26222634">There, the privilege against incrimination in England and when he was a Circuit Court Judge, Judge Taft pointed out was the statutory privilege.Here, it's a constitutional privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="6542.160" offset="26272057">And so, that's quite a different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6545.080" offset="26283656">But secondly, you talk about star chamber proceedings and the grand inquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="6552.913" offset="26315003">What could be worst than to take a man who knows he's going to be charged with a crime, take him away from his counsel, take him away from the opportunity to cross-examine and ask him a lot of questions about a lot of people and remember what Your Honors have all said here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6574.505" offset="26401416">That if he says, "I know Joe Brown" who may be his law partner or his brother, he may be deemed to have waived the privilege and opened the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="6587.182" offset="26452093">I'm not stating an extreme case but as I read the old -- the Rogers case, I find that I don't know where to tell a man to stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="6596.238" offset="26488351">Now, I want to go to the last of the questions presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="6600.375" offset="26504861">If I can have just another -- I have about three minutes, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="6605.126" offset="26523878">Here, we have again the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6609.567" offset="26541641">This presents a rather different problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="6613.102" offset="26555747">I must agree at the very outset that since this Court doesn't review facts, that I must accept the Circuit Court's opinion and majority opinion on this last question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6628.120" offset="26615829">It leads back to a question that Your Honors asked about the -- these acts of concealment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6638.795" offset="26658565">Somebody asked, "Well, who committed the acts of concealment?”</text>
            <text syncTime="6645.602" offset="26685733">That is asking people supposedly not to furnish information.</text>
            <text syncTime="6654.556" offset="26721573">It isn't true that there weren't separate charges about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6660.869" offset="26746859">Counts 5, 6 and 7 of this indictment actually charges Halperin, Grunewald and Bolich as a substantive offense with having impeded justice by asking three different persons to -- to testify so-called not -- or not to testify before a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="6687.532" offset="26853543">We'll omit the phraseology of the indictment for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="6693.292" offset="26876531">Yet, at the same time, when the case before the case went to the jury, the trial judge dismissed those counts against Grunewald and Bolich because there was no proof to connect them with him, and yet, the Government now says that under the conspiracy section, they could be held as being responsible for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6720.268" offset="26984469">And yet, we all know under section 2 of the -- of title 18 and later when the federal justice say in this and a -- as a conspirator and so that argument fails by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6732.463" offset="27033266">Those so-called overt acts of concealment were dismissed by the Court as against the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="6739.299" offset="27060537">But Halperin himself was a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6743.622" offset="27077883">And the -- as I read the facts, he for motives of his own and I'll be very frank to say and to protect himself advised three different persons that if they were called before the grand jury, they should plead the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6770.456" offset="27185194">The Court in its majority opinion said that Halperin never told anybody to lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="6778.857" offset="27218840">He never asked anybody to purge himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6783.938" offset="27239111">But as -- and apparently, he wasn't their lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6786.443" offset="27249142">He had been.</text>
            <text syncTime="6788.726" offset="27258232">And gratuitously, let's put it that way.He said to them, "If you're called, you plead the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6797.104" offset="27291773">I'm going to plead it."</text>
            <text syncTime="6799.000" offset="27299401">Now, I ask you, is that a crime?</text>
            <text syncTime="6803.142" offset="27315911">The Court said, “Of course, and its judge that if you ask anybody to plead the Fifth Amendment, you're not guilty of a crime.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6813.825" offset="27358647">However, the facts as the Circuit Court gives it reduces itself to this part.</text>
            <text syncTime="6821.018" offset="27387486">There were two cases on the Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6823.340" offset="27396681">One comes from California, Your Honor, in the (Inaudible) case in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6829.158" offset="27419982">It's never been reversed, never appealed and there was the almost similar situation, personal motives.</text>
            <text syncTime="6838.948" offset="27459166">Now, I say it makes no difference if you're a lawyer or a layman.</text>
            <text syncTime="6842.720" offset="27474213">I have a right to tell a stranger even if it's going to help me and Judge Taft said so in the urban cases, the only other case on this subject that I can point.</text>
            <text syncTime="6855.139" offset="27523950">The Government has cited none other -- I'll stop at this point.</text>
