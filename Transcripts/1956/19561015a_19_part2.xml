            <label>Mr. Morton Hollander</label>
            <text syncTime="5.567" offset="125680">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.853" offset="138742">The respondents in the napalm gel case and by incorporation by reference, the respondents in Number 19 have argued that there are outstanding a number of decisions of this Court holding that the two-year limitation period prescribed by Section 16 (3) of the Interstate Commerce Act is jurisdictional in a sense that it sets an outside boundary on the power of the Commission to entertain proceedings filed with -- after the expiration of the two-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.218" offset="304253">I believe that that was the -- the question Mr. Justice Harlan was interested in.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.731" offset="334346">Now, we -- we recognized the -- the existence of these series of decisions characterized by the respondents as an unbroken line of decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.746" offset="382307">We feel though that they are besides the point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.974" offset="403310">All of those decisions to the extent that they involved proceedings by shippers before the Interstate Commerce Commission are proceedings initiated independently as a matter of first resort by the shipper against the carrier before the Commission and none of those cases cited is establishing these jurisdictional limits on the Interstate Commerce Commission deal with the power of the Court as an incident of a proceeding timely filed before it to refer to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.483" offset="581256">I repeat as an incident of the power of the Court hearing the case to refer to the Commission a proceeding notwithstanding the lapse of the two-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.336" offset="620753">For that reason, we believe that -- that line of jurisdictional cases by itself, that reason alone, requires that those decisions on the jurisdictional point would be viewed as not -- not being in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.123" offset="699852">Now, their jurisdictional argument or the argument that these cases set a jurisdictional limit and the Commissions thereby deprived the power and can't take the case also ignores the fact and this is recognized by respondents in another face of their argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.298" offset="756590">It -- it ignores the fact that the Government is because it is the Government because it is the sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.485" offset="777279">It is entitled to a special immunity from statute of limitations provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.625" offset="801834">So that even if it were to be assumed as respondents necessarily contend that the reach of Section 16 (3) goes far beyond its language and extends not only to independent reparation proceedings but also to proceedings referred to the Commission as an incident of a timely filed suit in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.190" offset="888142">And even if that assumption were indulged in, the respondents cannot possibly explain away the fact that the United States traditionally has been held to be immune from such a statute of limitations provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.144" offset="951986">Now, the only time -- the only time the United States may be subjected to a limitation defense, the only time such a defense may be ruled to apply to the United States, and this Court has consistently held, is in a situation where Congress has explicitly manifested an intent to subject the United States to that particular statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.212" offset="1052191">In other words, if in Section 16 (3) (b), there were some explicit manifestation and the only way that manifestation could possibly be expressed would be by saying that independent reparation proceedings filed by the United States just as an independent reparation proceedings filed by any other shipper, they would have to refer explicitly to the United States and subject the United States to the bar of their two-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.363" offset="1152815">That, of course, was not done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.982" offset="1159293">The respondents seem to us to take a very inconsistent position because they recognize on the one hand that because of the sovereign -- this traditional sovereign immunity from limitations, the United States, the United States if it went into court beyond the expiration of the two-year period, if it went into court, Section 16 (3) they say they agree would be no bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.090" offset="1247692">Here, however, they insist that if rather than going to the Court directly, they are hailed into court and try to get before the Commission as an incident of a timely filed judicial proceeding, they somehow reason that this traditional sovereign immunity from limitations is thrown out of the window, so that the United States may be met whether he joined to that, you're too late now to go over to the Commission, even though you want to get there as an incident to a timely filed judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.640" offset="1377886">Now, we believe on either one of those two grounds, the line of cases holding that Section 16 (3) is jurisdictional, really has no application here.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.075" offset="1415711">First, as I've pointed out those cases involved independent reparation proceedings not those referred as an incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.291" offset="1440580">Secondly, it gives no consideration to the unique position.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.452" offset="1453223">The United States has always occupied in its immunity, special immunity from limitation defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.315" offset="1484675">For the reasons I've tried to outline and the reasons we advanced in the earlier case and those in our brief, we respectfully submit that the judgment of the Court of Appeals in number 19 and that the judgment of the Court of Claims in number 18 to be reversed with instructions in both cases remanding the cases to the lower courts in order to afford the Government, the petitioner here, a full opportunity to present all of its defenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="378.910" offset="1619048">Mr. Spicer.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="meade_t_spicer_jr" startTime="384.903" stopTime="654.649">
            <label>Mr. Meade T. Spicer, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="384.903" offset="1642977">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.340" offset="1648724">With reference to the question just discussed by Mr. Hollander, I do like to call attention to the brief filed in number 18, page 29, we incorporated by reference the argument there on this particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.701" offset="1742137">And on page 29, the -- as quoted from the Commission case itself, in fact in 80 I.C.C. in which it went into the reasons for its conclusion that it could not pass on a claim that was filed after two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.258" offset="1828446">And it said, “It is fundamental that we act only under the jurisdiction conferred upon us by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.305" offset="1856554">It is the status of the tribunal rather than the status of the litigant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="442.699" offset="1874213">In other words, that that point is relied upon here by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.193" offset="1904097">The power -- in other words, the statute created the right and also created the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.816" offset="1926666">Certainly, situation is not unusual to the law, one that is common I believe among the death statutes in -- throughout the United States, in the state statutes as well as on the Federal Employers' Liability Act statute that the -- where the right goes with the remedy when it's destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.684" offset="2006079">Now, I would like to ask the Court to look at page 21 of the record at a stipulation of counsel with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.114" offset="2047875">I do not think that this case, there's anything to decide in this case that hasn't already been decided in the case 12, and like 68.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.984" offset="2095313">Before this case was tried, there were a number of cases pending in the District Court in which the questions of frustrated traffic were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.755" offset="2138363">A stipulation of counsel was entered into in which it was agreed and signed -- signed stipulation on page 21, that the final judgment in case 12, Number 68 should govern the disposition of claims involved in this action to the extent that it is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.747" offset="2206386">Now, that copy -- that stipulation was filed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.058" offset="2219656">That was entered into -- back in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.791" offset="2234493">12, 68 was a test case which was litigated through the District Court and through the Circuit Court of Appeals, a year ahead of this case and that is the case that is referred to in the -- my opinion of Court of Appeals to say -- in which they said, it seems to us that this case has been fully decided and that we might well add nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.528" offset="2333445">In other words, those -- that -- the shipments involved in this case arose at the same time that the shipments involved in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.183" offset="2368136">The parties were the same, the destinations were the same, the starting points were the same, Pontiac, Michigan, Newport News, goods intended eventually to go to China by the port of Rangoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.395" offset="2412962">The only difference, the only factual difference there was that the Government in that case did not attempt to show anything after the goods got to Newport News.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.260" offset="2460400">They just closed that and said that we weren't able to carry out our plans because of all developments and that that was entered here.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.140" offset="2491956">In this case, they did go to the extent of showing that a year-and-a-half later after the goods had been unloaded and stayed at Newport News for three months as it did in the other case, they were reconsigned back to storage points in the country, government storage points.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.920" offset="2567084">They stayed in storage points and went to two-storage points stayed for a year, and were eventually exported not to China but to India not by Newport News but by Wilmington, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.254" offset="2636361">Now quite obviously, say that -- that was not a compliance as we see it with the tariff and we have filed here original transcript of a copy of a portions of the tariff that seemed to be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.781" offset="2706474">That was in -- in the first case.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.920" offset="2719013">They --</text>

            <text syncTime="654.649" offset="2721938">Suppose something had happened that they couldn't get out of the -- out of the port there at Norfolk and -- and they had to be -- the material had to be shipped up to Baltimore and eventually it went out of Baltimore, would that have destroyed the rate, do you think?</text>

            <text syncTime="671.389" offset="2788916">Well, I think it would have printed -- present a fairly close question.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.749" offset="2802395">I think possibly, they would have been entitled to it because of this particular tariff allowed other eastern ports, allowed exportation to be made through other eastern ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.009" offset="2847431">It had no application to anything, specific ports at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="815.396" offset="3364968">Norfolk is not as big a port as New York and Boston and that's -- that's the -- that's the background of -- for having it.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.654" offset="3394017">And when it got to Newport News and it was -- we didn't know anything about it being going across.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.778" offset="3426513">They -- we -- we -- bills for the freight charges were assessed as soon as it went to the first other point, which was Bloomfield, New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.552" offset="3469563">Now, in this case, as soon as there was -- they shipped to Bloomfield, New Jersey, bills were rendered by the CNO.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.708" offset="3502164">They not -- they all -- they -- they got -- collected a domestic rate from Newport News back to Bloomfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.143" offset="3523897">But in -- before doing that or when doing that, they presented the bill on the basis of a domestic rate movement from Pontiac to Newport News.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.294" offset="3568515">They were paid properly and that's the way this thing remains insofar as the Government is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.250" offset="3596413">I mention that because of the situation in other cases but they were paid properly and it was four years later before the CNO had any knowledge that there was any question about that being the proper rate to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.509" offset="3653360">The CNO had no knowledge of any subsequent transporting, transferring to India across -- across the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.562" offset="3685648">It had -- it didn't have any bill presented to it for -- to revise or anything like that, but four years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.086" offset="3711666">So that this claim, if there was a claim for reasonableness, died or -- or attacked on the reasonableness died while the matter was in the hands of the Government.CNO had no status before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.717" offset="3762239">Now, all that was gone until we say about the other case, we think it -- that by virtue of this stipulation of counsel in the case that that judgment is -- is binding in this case that there's nothing legally additional that make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.760" offset="3834441">The difference was simply that -- and the fact that I believe in -- in the case below, the first case, they did not actually apply for a hearing before the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.274" offset="3872475">They did question.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.103" offset="3875819">They bring up the question of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.289" offset="3884492">Now, we say that there isn't any question of reasonableness involved here and we think it's been a while substantiated because the same thing was brought up in both cases, in the first cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.724" offset="3926288">The District Court said, “Well, isn't that a question of reasonableness here?</text>
            <text syncTime="958.546" offset="3937573">All you're contesting is which rate applies.”</text>
            <text syncTime="961.557" offset="3949589">And he said, “I -- it seems to me that this Court is confident under these circumstances to say whether a though rate applies or vested.”</text>
            <text syncTime="969.156" offset="3979995">But he found that was a voluntary conversion in that first case and he specifically set out in the opinion of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.843" offset="4014791">There was a change of intention and that -- that was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.389" offset="4044884">He thought it was a domestic movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.995" offset="4055333">And that was -- that was a basis of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.819" offset="4066617">He said it was a voluntary -- Government voluntarily converted what had started out as an export shipment into a domestic shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.080" offset="4099741">There is no reason why it should not pay the domestic rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.428" offset="4113115">Now, in the course, the testimony wasn't very long here but is a reference to the fact that when the -- sometimes before the trial, question was raised as to what -- what was -- what we're trying to do with the goods in between and it was stated by a witness in General Accounting Office that they were trying to decide what they're going to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.324" offset="4188662">That was all that -- they knew it at the time they -- they moved it back to Bloomfield, New Jersey except they won't put some additional freighting order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.578" offset="4221680">Now, we submit that they say there -- there is no question of reasonableness except in a very superficial way involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.307" offset="4252609">There -- the shipments did not stop until after the attack of Pearl Harbor, December the 10th through January.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.506" offset="4285419">They are -- nothing was shown to have happened since then except the fall of Rangoon which happened about six weeks after they got there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.215" offset="4316244">And, of course, Rangoon was not the place, it has ultimate destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.238" offset="4332335">Rangoon was simply the port that they were scheduled to go out from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.893" offset="4346964">Now, we submit that it is not fair to place on the railroad with the knowledge that the Government had when these shipments moved from Pontiac.War had begun at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.242" offset="4404328">And that this is a -- not a risk that would -- should be fall upon the railroad to make a revision of its records or rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.746" offset="4450408">The carrier was -- the Government knew that when a shipper was submitted at Pontiac, Michigan that the rates and tax have effected that time ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.940" offset="4487084">And to see that the initial carrier, they had to take them under those tariffs which remained in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.210" offset="4528253">That is so plain and it seems to us and it seemed to the District Judge, there's no question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.115" offset="4551868">Nobody has attacked, presented any attack on these rates of reasonableness of its other rates by any proper proceedings and there's nothing to do but to enforce them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.744" offset="4598366">And they came back and say, that was in -- held in the first case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.808" offset="4614562">And that was -- it was conceived by this stipulation that the further second case should be governed by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.403" offset="4637027">No -- no application for a writ of certiorari was filed closing the first case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.337" offset="4652701">And they came back with exactly the same position and just said, “Well, it's unreasonable.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.796" offset="4670568">And the court tried to bring -- for -- for what circumstances make it unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.853" offset="4690735">And the only thing they could say, “Well, Rangoon fell, war was on before we began and that's all.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.635" offset="4709961">Now, that kind of a situation in relation to the great law and element of the case simply calls for a simple decision of a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.252" offset="4752384">It didn't require any battery of tariff experts, economic experts, anything of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.551" offset="4777566">It was a -- something that's similar to what a federal judge has to decide everyday.</text>

            <text syncTime="1205.001" offset="4923329">But so far as the first raise rule, they will be controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.995" offset="4939316">And they said, “Well, we got some additional circumstances here.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.809" offset="4954572">And they -- were afterwards exported at some remote time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.473" offset="4969305">Of course, we didn't agree that that was true, but we tried to facilitate a method by which the court might provisionally hear that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.987" offset="5003368">The court -- there wasn't any witness there from the General Accounting Office at all to explain anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="1761.818" offset="7150634">And I -- as I understand this Court to review is what happened in -- in the trial court, as long as the case was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.775" offset="7178428">The decision of the District Court was affirmed by the District -- Court of Appeals, this case and in the preceding case without any change at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1855.629" offset="7525857">The -- the stipulation controlled the Government, it is true to the extent that that case was similar to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.990" offset="7559293">But that case was different from this in at least these three respects and it was because of these differences in these three respects that we found it necessary to further litigate the second series of Chesapeake &amp; Ohio cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.504" offset="7641422">The first time the -- the first case, the one in which the stipulation is supposedly controlling, the first case did not involve any subsequent exportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.709" offset="7674232">Judge Parker's opinion in the first case seemed to place a great deal of emphasis on that fact that we had not, on the record shown, that there was any subsequent exportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.445" offset="7713102">In the second case, we were ready to show it.We had ample evidence of subsequent exportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.575" offset="7733687">That was a major difference number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.714" offset="7742255">In the first case, we never suggested that there should be a referral of the reasonableness question to the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.192" offset="7768168">Judge Parker in the first case thought that that was terribly important when we suggested that the Court of Appeals, the first time should -- and that the District Court, the first time we suggested the Court of Appeals should have state its proceedings and referred to the ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.818" offset="7818637">Judge Parker said, “Well, you didn't ask the District Court to.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.837" offset="7830758">That was in the first case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.478" offset="7837236">In the second case, we very explicitly asked the District Court to refer, the District Court denied the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.594" offset="7861791">It's basic difference number two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.053" offset="7871613">Finally, in the first case, there is a specific factual finding by the District Court that there was a voluntary conversion of that shipment from export into domestic by the Government, the District Court relying in large part on the fact that we never showed any evidence of subsequent exportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.603" offset="7945801">There is no such similar finding by the District Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.890" offset="7962937">In this case, the District Court simply viewed it as a question as to whether or not we're entitled to export rate, even though while he acknowledged subsequent exportation, it was from a port other than the original concerned port.</text>
