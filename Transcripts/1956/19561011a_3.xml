            <text syncTime="66.174" offset="368097">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.082" offset="375724">So we -- we don't have the question of whether or not it extends the period in violation of their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.963" offset="407176">Now, with regard to the Internal Security Act, I'd like -- of 1950, I'd like to call attention to several things about the pattern of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.543" offset="441553">It seemed to me that Congress was trying to provide for the registration, not only of individuals which was one of the more remote provisions of the Act, but for registration of the Party and the officers of the Party, and there were important sanctions with relation to the failure of the Party itself to so register.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.618" offset="541863">There was also a provision that the Party did not register and those sanctions came into being.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.085" offset="563702">The officers were required to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.090" offset="575718">And if the officers failed to register, then the members themselves would have to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.998" offset="607378">But the provisions in regard to the officers require the registration as to their functions and duties in their office.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.589" offset="657742">That seemed to us that the problem that Congress had was whether or not by reason of recitals as to the character of the Communist Party as a conspiracy in detailed form as was set out in that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.426" offset="725034">It might be construed by the courts as a provision in itself which, along with the registration or the membership, might establish the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.473" offset="773308">And it was that they were trying to reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.641" offset="785951">Now, when Senator Kilgore made his objections to the form of this proposed 4 (f) in connection with the Internal Security Act of 1950, there was no provision in the Act as it then was in regard to per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.721" offset="862229">And in conference, they added the provision in regard to per se, limiting it to per se as well as the provision or of any other criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.476" offset="925236">I'd like to call attention particularly to Section 17 of that same Act, which is set out on page 55 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.914" offset="983019">There, Congress provided the foregoing provision of this title shall be construed as being in addition to and not in modification of existing criminal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.654" offset="1065984">Now, we think regardless of anything else of our legislative history or any other interpretation that you could draw from the action of Congress in this matter that that should be conclusive because it seems to us, Congress said, “Whatever we do in this Internal Security Act of 1950, we just added on top of whatever we have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.415" offset="1177057">And whatever you do with it, don't take it to try to reduce what we already have.”</text>
            <text syncTime="277.692" offset="1214151">Now, I think you have a further problem if you adopt the construction that is advanced by petitioner's counsel in this matter in regard to Section 4 (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="288.313" offset="1256573">Because if you recall, the language of that section does not refer only to members as had been treated largely by petitioner's counsel in the brief as though it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.024" offset="1355421">But it also refers to officeholders and says neither the holding of office nor membership in any Communist organization by any person shall constitute per se a violation of these subsections or any other criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.535" offset="1433475">What is the effect of that?</text>
            <text syncTime="334.384" offset="1440893">If you are going to say that regardless of the fact that Congress deliberately and carefully said this should be limited to per se membership and not membership with knowledge as the Smith Act said, then what about the provisions about an officer who is required to register and tell what his functions and duties in his office are with regard to the other provisions of organization and advocacy in teaching in a conspiracy in the other parts of the Smith Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="374.195" offset="1600136">It seems to me that that forces upon the Court a construction that the entire provisions dealt within the Dennis Act were intended by Congress that was discussing the successes of the Government in dealing with this problem in the Smith Act prosecutions as an intention of Congress to wipe them all out, and I don't think that can be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.525" offset="1689475">But regardless of all the other refinements to the argument, when you get down to a proposition where Congress carefully says, “In the same statute practically at the close, that regardless of what we have done here, this is not to modify or reduce any of the criminal statutes that we've got in regard to this up to this point.”</text>

            <text syncTime="438.902" offset="1858957">That's my interpretation of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.278" offset="1868466">And I think the Court can deal with it like it did in the Hutchinson case in applying the Norris-LaGuardia Act to the Sherman Act as a matter of trying to interpret this situation, but not to reduce the Smith Act which Congress was not, in any mood or temper, to do at the time it passed this Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="544.059" offset="2279633">In regard to the person who writes a letter in -- into the Party who says that he's sending in the dues and he believes in the Party, in its objectives, in its purposes and its intent to accomplish a revolution by force and violence, we suggest that that has knowledge and that has intent, why isn't that a crime under the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="573.555" offset="2397602">And the thing that disturbed me about is whether or not you had membership in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.246" offset="2420381">In fact, and I think that you have to start with genuine membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.485" offset="2445354">We're familiar in -- in our activities in life that there's all kinds of membership, inactive, active, and the various organizations and many of them like various lodges or -- or groups you can't get into by merely writing letter saying you're for everything that they're intending to do or the objects and purposes that they have in mind in sending the necessary money.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.313" offset="2560606">You have to comply with their requirements before becoming a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.282" offset="2576488">And that is one -- that is the first step.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.829" offset="2590699">Now, what does the Communist Party require in regard to membership?</text>
            <text syncTime="627.251" offset="2612328">The Government's Exhibit Number 39 is a 1948 Constitution of the Communist Party of the United States was submitted in evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.523" offset="2653497">And in Article 2, Section 3, it is stated, “A party member is one who accepts the aims, principles and program of the Party as determined by its constitution and conventions, who belongs to a club and attend these meetings, who is active in behalf of the party program, who reads, and circulates the party press and literature, and who pays dues regularly.”</text>
            <text syncTime="671.107" offset="2787767">Now, that is the only evidence that I know of in the case as to the requirements of membership in the Communist Party except as you can deduce them from the actions of the petitioner and the witnesses in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1110.255" offset="4544345">In the following language, he commented that in July of 1917, the Czar had driven the Communist Party of Russia underground and had outlawed them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1144.091" offset="4679764">He said that if the depression came along, that would accelerate it still further and would make the job easier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.328" offset="4720724">Now, the jury had before it, the fact that the petitioner himself told the witnesses that he had gone underground, so the underground movement had occurred.</text>

            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="1240.306" offset="5064600">I would like to make two observations on the constitutional point arising out of the colloquy between the bench and the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.210" offset="5096260">Yesterday, Justice Harlan asked about the instructions given to the jury with respect to these added ingredients which may or may not be read into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.065" offset="5143594">I might say that the charge itself is to be found in the record here, page 107 to 16, but I think the answer to Justice Harlan's question is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.763" offset="5182464">That on the element of intent, which the Solicitor General wishes to read them, instructions were very clearly given that the jury must find intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.267" offset="5212453">There is no doubt about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.983" offset="5219349">But it is equally beyond doubt that no instructions were given on the added notion of the acts of membership much less where any instructions given on the idea that the Party must be a sort of quasi-conspiratorial body which is so much the basis of the Court of Appeals decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.141" offset="5299911">Now, Justice Minton asked the question along the same line, which was whether for a conviction here, there wouldn't have to be some kind of advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.618" offset="5337840">Well, it is quite clear, I believe, Justice Minton, that -- that there is no such requirement of statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.790" offset="5362500">There is no such charge in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.211" offset="5372217">And there is no such instruction to the jury, that is the -- the conviction here must stand on the basis where the element of personal advocacy is entirely absent and it must stand or fall on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.770" offset="5426448">Now, my other observation relates to the colloquy between the Solicitor General and Justice Frankfurter, in which Justice Frankfurter mentioned Bryant against Zimmerman, a case involving the Ku Klux Klan, and I thought with the suggestion perhaps that case was governing or relevant to the constitutional problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.958" offset="5511189">I do not, with all respect, believe it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.273" offset="5528430">I have refreshed my recollection about the case this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.424" offset="5541073">There is no problem of advocacy involved there and indeed, it was not a prohibitory statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.469" offset="5565210">That was a New York statute which related to societies bound by oaths.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.208" offset="5592168">It is a lineal descendant of old British statutes directed to the same end, which are referred to in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.679" offset="5622053">And there has always been a policy against those because such societies tend to punish their own members and oust the Court's jurisdiction varies to the factors like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.163" offset="5659982">It was for that reason that they require registration like the Internal Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.241" offset="5676387">It was not a prohibitory statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.092" offset="5683702">In Whitney against California, I think quite clearly, the concurring justices regarded the statute such as this one as raising an acute problem of both assembly and free speech.</text>
