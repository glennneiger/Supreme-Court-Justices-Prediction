            <text syncTime="18.903" offset="178970">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.720" offset="194226">This case presents the question of construction of the special patent venue statute, Section 1400 (b) of Title 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.284" offset="252531">The petitioner is a West Virginia corporation who has a place of business in New York City but who has committed no acts of infringement there.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.651" offset="301955">The respondent is a New York corporation and owns a patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.401" offset="324942">The respondent sued the petitioner for patent infringement in the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.943" offset="355140">The petitioner moved to dismiss on the ground that the venue requirements of the special patent venue statute, Section 1400 (b), were not satisfied since the petitioner was not a New York corporation and had not infringed in the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.529" offset="445524">The District Court granted the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.271" offset="456495">The Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.254" offset="468407">This Court granted certiorari in view of the conflict of the decision of the Court of Appeals with contrary decisions of other circuits on the same question.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.512" offset="521383">The specific question with respect to which this Court granted certiorari is reproduced on page 2 of the respondent's opening brief, the light (Inaudible) brief and is whether the 1948 revision of the Judicial Code changes the law and enlarges the permissible venue for patent infringement actions against corporate as distinguished from non-corporate defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.117" offset="691806">To permit a suit against the corporation in a judicial district where the corporation has not infringed and is not incorporated but is merely doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.538" offset="749484">In the consideration of this question, it is fundamental initially to recognize that Congress in the 1897, as a matter of policy, placed patent venue in a special category.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.798" offset="818552">The history of the 1897, first special patent venue statute, the reasons for its enactment as a matter of policy and the fact that by such policy, patent venue was placed in a special category were all thoroughly considered by this Court in Stonite against Melvin Lloyd and I will, therefore, not review them in detail here.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.851" offset="926804">The significant ultimate fact as this Court noted in Stonite is, "The Act of 1897 was adopted to define the exact jurisdiction of the federal courts in actions to enforce patent rights and thus, eliminate the uncertainty produced by conflicting decisions on the applicability of the Act of 1887 as amended to such litigation."</text>
            <text syncTime="234.564" offset="1041638">That purpose indicates that Congress did not intend the Act of 1897 to dovetail with the general provisions relating to venue in civil suits.</text>

            <text syncTime="277.866" offset="1214882">Yes, but it -- in the Stonite case, this Court referred to the decision in Bowers against Atlantic.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.960" offset="1247169">I will just read one sentence from that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.384" offset="1260857">It said, “The purpose of the Act,” referring to the 1887 Act, “was to narrow federal jurisdiction and it may be inferred that Congress intended to limit it to all classes of actions, infringement suits included for in no branch were complaints of injustice and oppression more numerous.”</text>
            <text syncTime="307.812" offset="1334627">That is in no branch than infringement suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="319.862" offset="1382797">So, with this thought in mind, the Congress enacted the first special patent venue statute in 1897.</text>

            <text syncTime="364.220" offset="1560221">The Act is reproduced on top of that page and as will appear, it specifies two alternative venue provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.258" offset="1596374">It states that in suits brought for the infringement of letters patent, the circuit courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction, in law or in equity, first, in the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant or second, in any district where the defendant, whether a person, partnership or corporation shall have committed acts of infringement and have a regular and established place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.534" offset="1717478">That Act contained a commensurate process section which constitutes the second sentence of it, which provides that if the suit is brought in the district in which the defendant is not an inhabitant, but where the defendant has a regular and established place of business, service may be head upon the agent's conducting the business.</text>

            <text syncTime="1098.384" offset="4496906">In the first place, inhabitant and resides were synonymous when this Act was passed and they both meant domicile and they both meant the state of incorporation as far as corporate -- corporation defendants are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.937" offset="4551137">In Suttle against Reich, 333 U.S. 163, handed down in 1948, this Court said, "The residence of a corporation within the meaning of these statutes has been frequently the subject of consideration by this Court for over half a century.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.590" offset="4637759">Shortly after Congress enacted Article 51 of the Judicial Code, this Court declared that the residence of a corporation within the meaning of the venue statutes is only the State and district in which it has been incorporated."</text>

            <text syncTime="1255.889" offset="5126980">Let's concede that as far as general corporate venue is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="1276.278" offset="5208482">But there can be really no question about what this Congress had in mind when they used resident in 1400 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.394" offset="5244949">I would ask the Court to refer to page 15 of the petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.938" offset="5299075">On that page and on the preceding page are the reviser's notes which accompanied 1400 (b) and as this Court knows, the Congress was particularly careful in the adoption of this law to see to it that all changes were reflected in these notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.588" offset="5369710">This Court has even said that these notes are obviously authoritative in perceiving the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.593" offset="5397713">Let us look at the number at paragraph 4 on page 15 of the brief from the reviser's notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.183" offset="5428120">It says, "Words in subsection (b), where the defendant resides, were substituted for of which the defendant is an inhabitant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.295" offset="5468557">A corresponding change was made in subsection (a), words "inhabitant" and "resident" as respects of venue are synonymous citing a note under 1391, which says the same thing and which cites three United States Supreme Court cases which say they both mean domicile and as to corporations mean state of incorporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.104" offset="5551835">If it please the Court, this patent venue Section 1400 (b) on its face is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.803" offset="5574614">It presents no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.403" offset="5580988">It means exactly what the prior Act meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.310" offset="5596662">It says we can have venue where the defendant resides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.408" offset="5612962">That's where he's domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.046" offset="5619545">That's what the old Act says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.929" offset="5627068">It says we can have venue where he has a place of business and where he has infringed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.450" offset="5645145">That's what the old Act said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.164" offset="5656012">We don't have any trouble with this statute until we try to do what the court below did and grabbed the bond, the general venue provisions from the general corporate venue law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.336" offset="5704704">And when we do that, we have a great deal of trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.264" offset="5720377">Just by way of introduction, I would ask the Court to look again at the final page of our opening brief where the statutes are reproduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.159" offset="5759979">The final statute on that page is the process statute, 1694, which also had its genesis in the 1897 Act and is now been recodified separately from 1400 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.292" offset="5820583">It says, "Any patent infringement suit commenced in a district where the defendant is not a resident, not a resident, but has a regular and established place of business, service or process may be head upon his agent or agents conducting such business."</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.980" offset="5895293">I feel that it is of controlling significance insofar as trying to discern what the scope of 1400 (b) was intended by Congress to be that this process section expressly recognizes that for patent infringement cases, the mere establishment of a place of business does not make a corporate defendant a resident of that district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.973" offset="5991215">Now, this is one of the minor incongruities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.096" offset="6003754">I would now point out that the engrafting on this special patent venue statute of the general venue provisions completely vitiates it as a special venue statute and as a venue limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.249" offset="6080345">In this respect, I think it is perhaps easiest to follow the result if we look at the statute as modified in the way in which the defendants would have it or the respondents would have it modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.666" offset="6154010">I would ask the Court to look at our brief on page 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.080" offset="6195702">In the center of that page, we have reproduced this special patent venue statute, Section 1400 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.357" offset="6240841">And having grafted upon it, the provisions of the general venue law as did the court below and as so amended, it would read as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.025" offset="6279502">“Any civil action against the corporation for patent infringement may be brought in the judicial district where the defendant resides to wit the judicial district in which it is incorporated or licensed to do business or is doing business or where it has committed acts of infringement and has a regular and established place of business.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.464" offset="6377200">It seems obvious that the first alternative thus reconstituted becomes abortive as a venue of limitation, as a definition of special venue in light of 1391 (c) and the second alternative becomes meaningless and surplusage as far as corporations are concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="1832.526" offset="7433488">This is important and I think that you will be interested in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.311" offset="7452609">This court below, the Second Circuit said, “It is quite clear even under our construction that this provision does have a sphere of usefulness against non-corporate defendants,” and which is what you have suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.932" offset="7507048">We suggest that the effect of this decision to arbitrarily restrict the utility of that provision to non-corporate defendants is in the teeth of the intent of Congress as reflected by the reviser's notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.218" offset="7564204">Now, on -- in the reviser's notes, in the fifth note, it says, "Words whether a person, partnership or corporation which follow defendants in the old Act have been omitted as surplusage."</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.027" offset="7631496">And it is the obvious intent of Congress that this provision extend to all defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.049" offset="7655528">This is just another of the incongruities that results when you try to engraft the general law on the special patent venue statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.565" offset="7709654">In conclusion, I think that there is probably an outstanding question and there has been in my mind how did these lower tribunals reached the conclusions they reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.085" offset="7755734">Why did they fall into what we contend to be the error?</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.570" offset="7773602">I have touched on that question briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.959" offset="7783215">I have suggested that they have refused to follow the rules, which require evidence of intent to change the law and have assumed that it was changed unless they can find some evidence of intent to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.360" offset="7840789">The rules by which they do this has been to call Section 1391 (c), a definition section, which it clearly is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.700" offset="7890213">Again, if we may refer finally to the last page of the petitioner's brief where the statute is reproduced and we look at 1391 (a) and 1391 (b) which are the diversity provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.217" offset="7968266">Those are the only provisions, which use the word “resides”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.515" offset="7993448">Now, in the reviser's note, accompanying 1391, this is said, "Word “reside” was substituted for -- were obvious an inhabitant for clarity in as much as inhabitant and resident are synonymous."</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.881" offset="8066905">Now, if the Court please, it is self evident that in 1391 (a) and in 1391 (b), resident, like it does in 1400 (b), means state of incorporation or domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.068" offset="8115597">Congress having reached that point was faced with the proposition that as to corporate venue an exception, general corporate venue an exception to make the law consistent with Neirbo, Schlumberger, Gulf Oil, had to be enacted and so, they took care of that in 1391 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.335" offset="8184665">1391 (c) is the exception on the general venue provision to make it consistent with the law as it existed in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.801" offset="8226565">And in closing, I will say that even if we accept this contention that 1391 (c) is a definition section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.776" offset="8262510">This respondent cannot prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.992" offset="8279333">In the case of Lawson versus Suwannee Fruit &amp; Steamship Company reproduced on -- in part of 32 of our brief, this Court held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.036" offset="8319561">Statutory definitions control the meaning of statutory words, of course, in the usual case, but if this -- but this is an unusual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.828" offset="8362715">If we read the definition in A.F. 1 in a mechanical fashion, we create obvious incongruities in the language and we destroy one of the major purposes of the second injury provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.168" offset="8416005">We have concluded that Congress would have not intended such a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.857" offset="8434813">Respondent's argument boils down to the contention that Congress destroyed one of the cornerstones of the law and intended to codify.</text>

            <text syncTime="2147.032" offset="8691545">Now, I think it is most helpful if first, we look and see what this statute is, that we are talking about, that's been classified by Mr. Irons as a special statute and it is perfectly true and we do not quarrel with his contention that the predecessor statute was a special statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.453" offset="8781197">And as a special statute, it was susceptible to the interpretation, which this Court gave it in the Stonite case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.870" offset="8818813">But this 1948 codification and revision and this Court has indicated that it contains many revisions and many changes in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.497" offset="8873357">The particular chapter here involved is called Chapter 87, District Court's venue, and I -- for convenience, I'm referring to the West Publishing Company pamphlet, which contains all the sections of this chapter in a single place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.854" offset="8934797">From there, we find a chapter containing 16 sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.947" offset="8955173">The first section of which is Section 1391 and it is -- it is subsection (c) of Section 1391, which is the first section we are considering and that is the section, which says that a corporation maybe sued in any district in which it is incorporated or licensed to the business and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.043" offset="9043571">Now, in addition, that is the first section and purports to my mind, at least, to be a definition which is to be applied when the remaining sections of this chapter are read.</text>

            <text syncTime="2400.072" offset="9703633">We find that word used just as it has been used in the other sections and without any hint or suggestion on the face of the Act, that it has to be given a different meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="2440.247" offset="9864338">Now, the court below stated in its opinion that nothing could be plainer as a matter of words than reading subsection (b) of Section 1400.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.437" offset="9921076">The suit -- this suit was authorized to be brought in the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.950" offset="9955140">Now, is there some reason -- some compelling reason why this plain language should not be given effect?</text>

            <text syncTime="2490.286" offset="10064541">But as a -- but I think to decide it, the way Mr. Irons has contended, introduced us more incongruities and makes it less rational than to decide it in a way I contend it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.650" offset="10125981">The first thing on the very face of the Act, it has been done as I've already just stated, is to give the word “resides” in a section, which is just part of a chapter of any sections, a different meaning from the meaning that has been given in all the other sections apparently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.161" offset="10204035">So, turning to the Revisers' Notes, there, Mr. Irons has also contended that these notes plainly, as a matter of fact, state that what Congress intended to do was to make this Section 1400 (b) mean the same thing as the predecessor statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.033" offset="10291493">Now, that I cannot follow and I think referring, Your Honors, to the Revisers' Notes, I can show that this is not necessarily so because -- and here, I refer to the congressional pamphlet which both sides have referred to extensively in their briefs and which is a convenient summary of the Reviser's Notes having to do with this codification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.998" offset="10427329">Section -- under Section 1391, the Reviser's first list of the sections of the prior law, which they were revising and codifying and they mentioned that the word “reside” was substituted for, where of he is an inhabitant for clarity in as much as inhabitant and resident are synonymous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.561" offset="10517608">Now, this -- in this Section 1391, they had just placed in the law the definition that a corporation resides or its residence is where it is doing business or includes the place where it's doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.808" offset="10594617">When we come to Section 1400, the note made by the Revisers refer this back to Section 1391, where they had just given the definition with respect to a corporation of the meaning of the word “residence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.651" offset="10662013">So, I submit that nothing could be plainer that they did change the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3274.414" offset="13201011">As a matter of fact, the abuses which they referred to were because of a supposed restricted venue and we find such statements as the fact that business is going west and the -- the Congress was afraid that -- that eastern businesses, eastern corporations would be committing infringing acts injuring perspective plaintiffs out in the west and that those complainants would be unable to bring suit of where they were being injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.321" offset="13360671">And for the reason, the patent -- the patent venue section of 1897 was broader.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.772" offset="13390451">It was being purposely made broader than venue general.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.735" offset="13410304">Now, it is our contention of that in codifying the law in 1948, particularly, having reference to the philosophy of the International Shoe and other cases that the Revisers must have had in mind that the corporations now should again be subject to suit for patent infringement on at least its broader basis as defendants generally in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.617" offset="13565889">And I, particularly, wish to call this Court's attention to the fact that this history, which I have just mentioned, was not at least to brought -- it was not brought to the attention of this Court in the briefs in the Stonite case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.823" offset="13634644">And possibly, the Stonite decision might have been different if that had been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.434" offset="13749060">Turning to the next point, it has been repeatedly stated by my brother that this 1948 Act constitutes a codification and as such any statute in it which has a predecessor statute should be construed in the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.770" offset="13846444">Now, I would call this Court's attention to a number of decisions which are in our brief indicating that many courts in construing this Act had many time stated that it is more of a mere codification but a revision and contains many changes, not the list of which was the change are made in Section 1391 (c) itself, corporate venue generally using the definition of residence which was an important change and which went beyond the way reduction in the Neirbo case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.887" offset="14006941">Now, that change was not reflected in the Revisers' Notes and that's just one of many.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.118" offset="14035884">As a matter of fact, there are some indication that the Revisers' Notes while purporting to point out every physical change, that is change of wording and text, by no means are purported to point out all changes of meaning in substance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3556.152" offset="14327933">Now, the Lawson case was mentioned as authority for not construing the Section -- Section 1400 (b) as we suggest that it should be construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.696" offset="14390105">And I suggest to the Court that the Lawson case is clearly distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.598" offset="14421765">This was a case involving a second accident to a person who had been injured and an interpretation of the word “disability” in the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.464" offset="14477249">It should be pointed out that a mechanical reading of the definition, which had previously been given of the word “disability” resulted in -- in making very poor sense out of the section in question and secondly, defeated an apparent major purpose of Congress in passing the Act as was reflected by some of the comments in the hearing on the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.207" offset="14636178">And finally, I would like to reiterate that using the definitions, which has been given in this codification, in this section rather in this chapter, we arrived at a result which it makes perfect sense logically, which produces no great inequity and which makes the whole chapter involving the other special sections on venue to read as a logical hole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.714" offset="14806183">I would say there would be ample reason to resort to twisting words out of their apparent meaning as given in -- in a definition if some illogical, unreasonable or oppressive result would be reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.066" offset="14871594">Now, but here, I think a very beneficial result can be reached in applying a broader venue with respect to patent infringers having in mind the transfer provisions of Section 1404, which are clearly -- which are clearly new in the code and which make provision for a transfer of patent litigation cases from any district in which they were brought oppressively to a district which is more convenient for the parties and the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.249" offset="15016417">And read with the transfer of provisions, I submit that Section 1400 (b) that makes perfect sense in reading it and using the definition and which is provided in the first part of the chapter.</text>

            <text syncTime="3746.583" offset="15089664">I have, sir, very brief comments, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.450" offset="15125191">If the Court please, I think in the first place, it is self evident why those decisions where cited by the Revisers' Notes with respect to the substitution of an evident or resident or conversely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.581" offset="15177644">Every one of those decisions, say, that those words are synonymous because they mean domicile and as to corporations, they mean state of incorporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.903" offset="15210977">They couldn't have been more explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.149" offset="15223933">We have had it suggested here that this history argument based on the history of the 1897 Act, somehow or another should lead this Court to reach a different result than it did in Stonite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.877" offset="15286836">We are told that this history was not before the Court in Stonite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.510" offset="15305435">The fact is that this is the same old argument, which was advanced before the Court of Appeals with the Third Circuit in -- in Stonite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.920" offset="15347022">It was on that argument that the Court of Appeals based its decision and this Court reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.883" offset="15370951">By reference to page 4 of our reply brief, it would be noted that the Court of Appeals in Stonite stated are historical review that revealed that Congress has always accorded patent litigants a broader venue, then that extended to other civil litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3831.777" offset="15430510">In light of this history, it hardly seems like it that Congress intended by the Act of 1897 to withdraw from patent litigants that statewide venue and had accorded from the beginning to all others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3844.359" offset="15480769">This is the identical argument which has urged on you again today and which was rejected in the Stonite case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.847" offset="15510758">There was an argument made that some significance should attach to the fact that 1400 (b) and 1391 are in the same Act, so same argument was advanced in Stonite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3864.532" offset="15561540">This Court said, “The reenactment of the Act of 1897 as Section 48 and R.S. 740 of Section 52 of the Judicial Code is not indicative of any congressional understanding that the two sections are complementary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.425" offset="15633115">And we have been told that the Revisers collected a lot of information to guide Congress in the reenactment of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3891.007" offset="15667388">There is no evidence in kind, the Revisers did not gather any information on the reenactment of the special patent venue law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.718" offset="15702288">It was reenacted without change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.228" offset="15712319">The only comment about venue that we have been able to find in the Revisers' Notes is in the House Report, which say, “So also, minor changes were made in the provisions regulating the venue of the District Courts to clarify ambiguities and reconcile conflicts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.571" offset="15789641">These are reflected in the Revisers' Notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3925.093" offset="15803747">There is no indication in the Revisers' Notes of any change in venue in special patent cases.</text>
