            <text syncTime="259.524" offset="1142450">Mr. Molder, member of the Committee, then examining was to what extent or in what manner did you cooperate, did you attend meetings of the leadership of the Communist Party, or was your cooperation with some of the movements that they were undertaking in cooperation with the labor at that time?</text>
            <text syncTime="275.617" offset="1206815">Well, the cooperation as I referred to in my statement was had by contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.090" offset="1228758">I've been present at meetings, coxes I referred to, and that is what I mean by cooperation.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.001" offset="1252373">Did you participate in any political meetings where only communist were involved?</text>
            <text syncTime="291.349" offset="1269823">I have attended in my work in the labor union thousands of meetings, sometimes as many as four days, answered about any specific meeting, it would necessarily have to be pinpointed to some recollection.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.704" offset="1315171">Well, did you consider yourself as actually affiliating yourself within this cause or the philosophy of the Communist Party movement during that period or time or were you using the Communist Party in your work as a labor leader?</text>
            <text syncTime="315.240" offset="1365326">That is the point I was trying to make clear a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.584" offset="1378701">I was trying to distinguish.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.161" offset="1385075">We do distinguish between those activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.996" offset="1396360">Well, I would say that on occasions there was no difference in opinion on a position, which I might have felt the Communist were also in support of that position, and I did not oppose it.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.606" offset="1438783">But where I felt that their position different with mine, I did oppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.895" offset="1456024">And he goes on and describes in some detail, the collaboration that he had during that period with the members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.823" offset="1495730">Then on page 156 of the record is a detailed testimony of Mr. Spencer, in which each one of these people that the petitioner was later asked about, whether they were members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.934" offset="1568141">Were gone into in detail and the questioning demonstrates, it seems to the Government, very clearly what the Committee was trying to find out.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.483" offset="1606280">They were asking about the membership of this particular Communist Party sale or group in the quad cities.And then they took each one of them and tried to find out what those people did.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.947" offset="1668138">Various ones were in the AF of L Union and so we're not in the particular union that the petitioner was in, some of them worked in the city and were not in a union activity, and others were closely identified with the union activity of this particular union that had become infiltrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.018" offset="1744520">In fact, there is one question at the middle of page, what positions in the union were held by members of your branch of the Communist Party?</text>
            <text syncTime="419.875" offset="1783912">Well, I was vice-chairman of the local and Chairman of the grievance Committee, and Walter Rumsey was Chairman of the local, and Gus Gustafson was secretary of treasurer of the local, and Hazel Jones was the steward in the local, was steward in the tractor drivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.446" offset="1842218">And I believe those are the only executive positions within the local, there were held by many to the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.041" offset="1868549">Did that virtually assure Communist control of the activities in the union, a good sharer?I would say -- I wouldn't say absolute control, but quite a bit of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.883" offset="1915883">And then they go on with each one these people trying to identify what function they had with relation to union activities in that area, whether they were -- and did find out that they were Communist Party members from Spencer and Rumsey.</text>

            <text syncTime="671.939" offset="2792135">And so, we are saying that in this particular proceeding, that it was a reasonable legislative purpose and legitimate in this, in trying to discover the facts about whether or not to legislate in this matter, to try to find out where the truth lay between these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.804" offset="2879592">Now, we do not claim on behalf of the Government that there's any right to expose for purposes of exposure and I don't know that Congress has ever claimed any such right.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.963" offset="2924210">But we do say that they're in the same ground, that there is a right to inform the public at the same time they inform the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.307" offset="2969663">And I think that's inherent in our system because if matter comes up, then maybe a considerable public opinion in the country that certain legislation should be enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.805" offset="3027655">And the Congress might make an independent investigation with such skill on investigators that it has and find out, as a matter a fact from that investigation, that legislation is not required, that the situation is not as the public believes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.942" offset="3100170">Now, it seems to me it's very proper for them to have a hearing and develop the facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="897.931" offset="3696076">Now, if you go beyond that, you have the question of whether or not you're going to try the members of the Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="930.438" offset="3826166">Or do you have to go beyond that, from the House and include the Senate, because each of them engaged in this activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="945.549" offset="3886561">If the Chairman makes a speech or statement in which he purports to state what the purpose of intention is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1557.193" offset="6333189">It was shown that there was a considerable mass of evidence that the Committee did have in these files.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.007" offset="6360461">But the counsel did testify that he was briefed carefully in regard to this particular matter and whatever the Committee had by the investigators who were supposed to be familiar with the material and the files, and he then proceeded to make the various inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2898.037" offset="11696546">I was at the Committee in the trial court, the Court of Appeals and I read the briefs in this case, that suggested that Rumsey's testimony was connected with our testimony in the sense that that sentence about propaganda was ever put to us, has never been mentioned in any document in this case until we came in this Court and heard this, this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.906" offset="11784004">In others words, what I am suggesting is that the very point I was making has been demonstrated, you can always look for something somewhere that wasn't told to the witness but that somebody else could say might have been relevant, had it been told to the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.939" offset="11836144">Now, maybe Rumsey and Spencer testified two years before.</text>

            <text syncTime="2949.100" offset="11900824">They didn't ask him one question about any substantive thing they had asked Rumsey and Spencer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.193" offset="11925170">They only asked him to name these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.743" offset="11935410">Now, I'd like to answer Mr. Justice Brennan's question on that -- on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.506" offset="11954427">I would take -- take it was did not -- when he denied the thing about himself, didn't he then bring into question, the credibility of Rumsey and Spencer about these other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.076" offset="12000716">Of course he did.</text>

            <text syncTime="3009.423" offset="12142090">I then have a privilege against libel and slander in doing it and then they subpoena my associate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.340" offset="12169780">There had been no legislative purpose in my going before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.985" offset="12180334">It had been a clearly intended exposure by me and the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.760" offset="12199455">Then they subpoena my associate and they asked her if all of these people were Communist, and she says, "I would not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3034.768" offset="12243446">I cannot inform on them."</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.622" offset="12250864">The fact that I have been a willing tool of the exposure of the Committee does not give them a right to subpoena somebody else and force them to be a tool of the Committee to determine whether the willing tool of exposure was in fact engaged in a legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.104" offset="12316797">In other words, the fact that Rumsey and Spencer were willing tools of the House Committee on the exposure point does not make petitioner when he goes before them, require to answer questions that were asked for exposure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.809" offset="12379596">So it seems to me that where the Solicitor General and I find company is not -- not the petitioner had in questions the credibility of Rumsey and Spencer, of course he had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.091" offset="12424735">Although, I would point out that there is no question of petitioner's credibility in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.535" offset="12446574">First, because of the fact that it's a contempt case and they did not take any action against him, and second, and I would ask Your Honors to look at page 59 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.463" offset="12486280">There is a statement at the bottom of the page, beginning of the second paragraph on page 59 which is very important related to this, a more complete and candid statement of his, "That the petitioner passed political associations and activities can hardly be imagined.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.453" offset="12574260">Now here, the Government is saying, "This fellow was willing to tell everything."</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.124" offset="12592859">Of course they said this in order to prove we didn't have a First Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.638" offset="12606966">But they said, you could hardly imagine a man that's been more candid about this and yet they want to say, nevertheless, he has got to answer questions and become a tool of exposure because Mr. Rumsey and Spencer were willing to be tools of exposure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.056" offset="12676660">I suggest to Your Honors that Rumsey and Spencer could have refused to answer those questions on the same grounds that the only purpose -- the purpose made in the Government's brief was to build a list of Communist in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.978" offset="12728278">If they could have refused to answer those questions because of the ground of exposure, the fact that they were a wiling tool of it doesn't make him a necessary part of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3520.137" offset="14184970">I have no doubt that we did raise it and we raised each stage in the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3543.794" offset="14279534">But the problem arises when Congress seeks to utilize the criminal processes, where an individual has the right to raise these points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.208" offset="14325196">Now, Mr. Justice -- the Solicitor General in answer to Mr. Justice Brennan's question said, “Yes, in the field of communism, the only area you can defend on is the Fifth Amendment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.966" offset="14376291">Now, I just don't believe that the decisions of this Court hold anything like that or that the -- or possibly could hold that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.104" offset="14408788">There is a weighing under the Fifth -- First Amendment that is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.216" offset="14425297">There is the vagueness that must be considered.</text>

            <text syncTime="3585.665" offset="14447031">It seems to me to say that anybody who is ever in anyway got in one foot anywhere near the Communist movement has lost all his rights against criminal prosecution for refusing to answer questions is to say that if we had taken one area out of American life and said there and there only there are no defenses in refusing to answer questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.101" offset="14536788">Now, I suggest that Your Honors had settled that in the Sinclair case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.169" offset="14553088">I thought that that had really settled the point on which this Court said it knows on certain terms that the presumption of validity is great but the presumption of innocence is greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.774" offset="14611498">And it seems to me that that's exactly what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.424" offset="14622051">Congress wants to require answers at the Bar of the House, there are certain rights that they have.</text>

            <text syncTime="3641.037" offset="14668549">But when they prosecute criminal for a question, where the relevance has never been stated by the Committee and where a different relevance is presented every time I go to a different court with this case and I hear a different effort to rationalize this reason for these questions, I can only feel it seems to me, perfectly clear that the only possible reason for asking a man the names of whether certain persons were Communists in the 19 -- mid-1940's.</text>
