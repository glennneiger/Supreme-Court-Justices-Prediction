            <label>Mr. Douglas M. Orr</label>
            <text syncTime="43.680" offset="278131">The petitioner here is Goodall-Sanford, Inc, a Maine corporation that did have a very substantial textile business at Sanford, Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.853" offset="326823">The respondent is AFL local 802 -- 1802 now AFL-CIO Local 1802 and United Textile Workers of America CIO.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.691" offset="378128">The parties entered into a collective bargaining agreement in 1951, which was renewed in 1953 and which expired in July 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.869" offset="434866">That agreement provided among other things that management of the business was to be vested exclusively in the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.199" offset="472168">That an employee's service continued until it was terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.357" offset="492753">An employee's service could be terminated for any of three reasons, a voluntary quit, a discharge for cause, or a layoff for a period of 18 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.370" offset="552835">The contract also provided for the customary four steps of grievance procedure which were not followed in this case, but which were deemed to have been waived by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.221" offset="600273">Following those four steps, contract provided for arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.763" offset="618454">It also provided for the usual no-strike clause except on a question of a general increase in wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.811" offset="658578">Now, the contract also provided for certain benefits to the employee and those benefits are what are in issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.422" offset="705076">One is vacation pay for employees who are on the payroll on June 1st of any year and who had 900 hours of service since the previous June 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.135" offset="759933">Secondly, it provided for certain hospitalization, Blue Cross, and life insurance benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.316" offset="796609">And the application of those benefits to employees on layoff was somewhat different from those who were terminated in that they could continue paying a reduced premium and keep them alive during the layoff period.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.367" offset="856795">Thirdly, the contract provided for pensions to employees who had 20 years service of $20 a week upon reaching age 65 and of $25 a week -- a month -- thank you, for those who had 25 years of service upon reaching age 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.725" offset="946239">Now, the general background on this case, Goodall-Sanford, Inc.had sales for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1954 of approximately $50 million and a loss before taxes of about $4.5 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.626" offset="1025860">Consequently, sometime in the spring of 1954, liquidation of a substantial part of the operations was contemplated and plans were made for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.973" offset="1079254">Incidentally, during the summer of 1954, Burlington Industries, Inc.made a public tender for the common stocks of Goodall-Sanford and is now an owner of substantially all of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.399" offset="1141008">The liquidation of the --of the company's plants at Sanford, Maine continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.667" offset="1162010">And by the end of May 1955, it had completely gone out of business there and all of its employees had been terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.775" offset="1202448">Now, Goodall-Sanford, Inc.as a corporation is still alive and it still operates two plants, one at Hot Springs, North Carolina and another at Reading, Massachusetts.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="288.255" offset="1256364">And in any event, Burlington, Inc.is taking it over?</text>

            <label>Mr. Douglas M. Orr</label>
            <text syncTime="290.714" offset="1266186">That's right, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.788" offset="1274546">Now, in January of 1955, some 1100 hired employees who were then on layoff status, were notified that they would be terminated because the departments in which they worked was completely shut down and would not reopen in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.147" offset="1348002">In February 1955, some 255 more employees were also terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.150" offset="1383946">In March of 1955, the Union asked the company to arbitrate the issues involved in whether they had a right to terminate these employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.820" offset="1438699">And this request was refused by the company on the ground that it was a prerogative of management to close the business for economic reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.368" offset="1476838">And that it also had the right to terminate employees incidental, thereto, if there was no hope of ever re-employing.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.565" offset="1517589">So, I will say that in this case of the three that are here before the Court today, the decision of the Court is of very material importance aside from the principle involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.186" offset="1580074">Because a fairly substantial amount of money is involved and the question of whether they are entitled to vacation pay, whether those who were terminated and thereafter would have gotten pensions would be entitled to them and certain incidental insurance benefits which they might have been deprived of prior to the termination of the union contract, July 1955.</text>

            <text syncTime="651.290" offset="2708564">Now, in the First Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Magruder, at the same time had reversed another District Court in the General Electric case applying the late Judge Clifford's decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.653" offset="2761958">And he said first, that the order of the District Court was appealable since it was a final order.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.639" offset="2785886">That's a question that's unique to this case of the three and also a question, incidentally, which was not raised in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.303" offset="2828622">But he held that it was appealable, nevertheless.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.193" offset="2844191">Second, he said that the Court had jurisdiction under Section 301 but it could not grant an injunction under that section compelling arbitration because this -- the substantive common law of the federal courts would not permit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.609" offset="2921827">However, and he said incidentally that the substantive federal common law would have been applicable and not the state law because it wasn't a diversity case.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.205" offset="2964146">Thirdly, he raised for the first time, U.S.Arbitration Act in this case which wasn't considered either by the respondent or the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.543" offset="3005524">And he said under the U.S.Arbitration Act that it was, the Court did have jurisdiction to compel arbitration both because this was not in a form of the contract and it was a transaction -- a -- contract governs in a transaction in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.946" offset="3091205">He also considered the Norris-La Guardia Act and held it inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.491" offset="3117328">And finally, he decided that the dispute of whether the company have the right to terminate employees was inarbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.069" offset="3175633">He also volunteered the suggestion in the General Electric case that the question of the very arbitrability of the contract might be passed on to the arbitrator if the parties have worded their contract so that the arbitrator had that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.226" offset="3244283">So, we view the legislation that Judge Magruder enacted as almost a complete application of the general jurisdiction of federal courts in this entire hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="813.351" offset="3356818">He further held that in this case the very wide discretion given to the arbitrator to determine what remedies were proper was correct and the arbitrator's decision was to be final and binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.643" offset="3417945">And finally, he even suggested that the decree of the Court might not be appealable.</text>

            <text syncTime="841.868" offset="3470817">Now, I'm going to touch on only those points that I think might have some material bearing on this dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.635" offset="3513866">Now, the first one is what federal question is involved?</text>
            <text syncTime="857.483" offset="3533302">And I think that question has been decided by the (Inaudible) case in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.478" offset="3561305">In that case, the complaint by the union was that the company had breached an agreement to pay certain welfare benefits through a commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.206" offset="3604146">And it asked for past damages for its past failures and an injunction against discontinuing to make those payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.839" offset="3634761">And the Court noted that the contract was made in Texas, was to be performed in Texas, and was breached in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.131" offset="3667884">And it stated and has the language that it said -- said it here and I think it's very apt.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.846" offset="3698709">The crucial problem is the degree to which federal law affects the decision of the controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.762" offset="3722428">In the instant case, federal law does not affect it at all on its merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.226" offset="3752312">I think the same thing is true in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.606" offset="3761821">I think that if I had read the statutes at large from the beginning to the end I could not have found the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.804" offset="3794631">I think that was Mr. Wernick's job and I don't think he will point one out to you either.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.353" offset="3816782">That same decision was reached in Amalgamated Association versus Southern Bus Lines in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.917" offset="3847084">In that case, the union brought suit on behalf of its members against a bus line to compel arbitration of changes in the employment contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.008" offset="3887417">And the plaintiff apparently alleged these grounds for jurisdiction but the suit was based on facts arising out of interstate commerce on the contract involving interstate transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.938" offset="3935169">And therefore, arises under the laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.714" offset="3950216">Now, I assume that it was so and it was construed as an argument an allegation that it was a question arising under the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.306" offset="3996609">In any event, the Court said what is here involved is merely a controversy between the parties as to the construction of a contact which allegedly arises out of the laws of the United States, respecting collective bargaining between employers and employees in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.538" offset="4081560">But the right of action asserted does not arise out of those laws, but only arises from the subsequent contractual relations of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.621" offset="4129834">The wrongful breach of such relations does not confer federal jurisdiction unless there is diverse citizenship.</text>

            <text syncTime="1028.273" offset="4216456">Now, it may be said that if none of these questions arise under a federal law, then how could a 301 case come at -- up at all?</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.089" offset="4259715">And in my opinion, it is quite remote and it's even remote in the case of a cause of action simply for damages either by a company against a union or by a union against a company because there is no federal statute under which it arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.463" offset="4329200">Now, there could be cases and I think the cases, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, were mentioned in a note you made to Westinghouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.444" offset="4365145">For example, suppose a contract contained a provision that the union members would not engage in partaking -- in picketing the premises of a customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.288" offset="4412479">Well, that might be a secondary boycott question which is covered by section 303 and therefore, you might say that that case arises under a federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.757" offset="4454379">Or you might have a provision that the company agrees that it will not overtly or otherwise, make any payment to any representative of the union and there you might have a case that comes up under section 303 which forbids that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.762" offset="4518431">Similarly, you could have provisions in a contract which involve unfair labor practices which would thereby give the jurisdiction -- give jurisdiction to a federal court under section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.319" offset="4568691">It's our position you should not go further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.310" offset="4588648">The second point I wish to cover is that assuming the Court does have jurisdiction, can it compel arbitration?</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.642" offset="4625951">Now, our view is that the Fifth Circuit in the Lincoln Mills case and the Steelworkers case in the Seventh Circuit decided last month are right on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.023" offset="4683421">Both of them followed the same reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.384" offset="4696900">The Steelworkers case, in fact, just sprung along with the Fifth Circuit in the Lincoln Mills case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.778" offset="4730441">But they -- the -- the Court in the Galland-Henning Manufacturing Company case which was the Steelworkers case said, "That a reading of the plea on an ambiguous language, however, forces us to review that no substantive rights will create."</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.055" offset="4815600">The -- the Lincoln Mills majority opinion said, "There's no federal substantive law out of which to fashion such a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.333" offset="4852694">And there's no state law out of which to fashion such a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.846" offset="4866800">So, there can be none assuming the U.S.Arbitration Act is inapplicable."</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.891" offset="4890937">Now, if this question turns on whether arbitration would substantially affect the outcome as has been mentioned in some cases, while whether this is a diversity case or not, we think that it does substantially affect the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.391" offset="4980903">Incidentally, I should like to mention a recent Article in 66 Yale Law Journal at page 167, which points out that the common law rule against enforcement of future disputes for arbitration has been abrogated in only 15 States out of the 48 and that of those 15, only seven specifically permit the application to an agreement in a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.858" offset="5106813">An example for example, is Massachusetts which provided that the parties to a contract may submit future -- agree to submit future disputes to arbitration, but then it went further and said specifically, that an arbitration agreement in a union contract is valid and enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.301" offset="5196570">I think that if you -- if -- if arbitration did not seriously affect the outcome of these cases, we wouldn't be here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.446" offset="5237112">The union, I'm sure, has selected arbitration much if a very drastic change from the view, they took of it many years ago because they believe they will come out better by a decision of an arbitrator unfettered by the judicial protection that a court puts around this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.571" offset="5325615">In 1929, the union took a different position and this is mentioned in the petitioner's brief in the General Electric case, where in their bulletin they said that arbitrators won but sometimes for appeal and they would do so even more if they knew that Courts where going to judicially enforce these agreements.</text>

            <text syncTime="1390.479" offset="5665311">I would like to point out a comment that was made in petitioner's brief in the Lincoln Mills case in which he said there are two theories of the function of an arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.023" offset="5707421">One, he interprets the language of the contract, and the second is that he tries to reach some mutually acceptable decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2358.346" offset="9536763">Now, section 4 of the Arbitration Act provides that a litigant can come in and enforce arbitration under section 4 if the United States Courts had jurisdiction except for the agreement to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.344" offset="9628714">Well, I think that -- and I'm coming to this in just a moment, except for the agreement to arbitrate, you don't have anything here but a Westinghouse case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.445" offset="9665181">But he gets around that by saying, “Well, we will use sections 1 and 2 of the Arbitration Act to say that this is a valid and enforceable contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.801" offset="9710529">But we elect not to use section 4 because we can't use it."</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.467" offset="9729233">Now, as this Court knows there's been several interpretations of section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.455" offset="9753161">That the definitions in section 1 of U.S.Arbitration Act are applicable to the entire Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.420" offset="9777089">It's an integral statute and I submit very earnestly that you cannot use Sections 1 and 2 and then because you can't comply with section 4 that we will rely on general equitable jurisdiction to let us enforce it even though we can't comply with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.334" offset="9840724">And I want to specifically mention two things in section 4 that are very material on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.786" offset="9862562">One is that a party may ask for a jury trial if either there is an issue on whether the agreement to arbitrate was made or whether the agreement to arbitrate was breached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.881" offset="9922853">And I might mention that the petitioner here did not have that election because the U.S.Arbitration Act was never mentioned at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.031" offset="9955453">We didn't have the choice of a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.434" offset="9965066">And although it wasn't a substantial issue in the court below, it might have been if we felt we could have got a jury rather than the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.158" offset="10015953">Now, coming to the underlying merits of the case aside from the agreement to arbitrate, you have nothing in the world here but the Westinghouse case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.061" offset="10063600">In Westinghouse, the union asked for a declaratory judgment that 4000 employees were entitled to one day's pay in April.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.819" offset="10106650">Here, you have a request for arbitration that some 1400 employees should be entitled to vacation pay, should be entitled to pensions where they have length of service sufficient to warrant them, and that they should have certain money payments under the group insurance provisions of the group insurance contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.426" offset="10193063">So, absent, the agreement to arbitrate, you don't have anything in the world here but a Westinghouse case and I submit that an agreement to arbitrate and specific enforcement of that agreement is practically the same as a declaratory judgment on the part of the union asking for the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.466" offset="10269236">Now, if in -- a declaratory judgment is granted under section 2202 or maybe -- 2202.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.291" offset="10312495">The federal court may go further and grant whatever relief it -- it feels may be warranted on the basis of the declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.258" offset="10344364">Here, if this Court enforces specific arbitration, the arbitrator is at liberty to grant whatever relief might be warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.876" offset="10386892">But I might point out that if the arbitrator says that the Union is entitled to no relief, I believe that 1400 employees are not barred at all in any way from going into a state court and suing on their particular contract of hiring, the company has got to start all over again.</text>

            <text syncTime="2873.117" offset="11595839">-- involving the same question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.682" offset="11606079">I think in the eight minutes or so that I have, Your Honors, I can best occupy myself by instead of engaging in a formal -- beginning of a formal presentation, attempt to answer a few of the questions which have been raised in the prior arguments on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.472" offset="11677236">And so doing, I would like to address myself first to Mr. Justice Whittaker's question as to the nature of the grievance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.105" offset="11711822">I gather that he's a little concerned that the union was trying to keep this employer in business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.840" offset="11738781">I want to make it clear, that when we filed a grievance against the termination of these employees, we were not contending for a minute that the employer had to keep them on the payroll in the sense of paying them and giving them work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.941" offset="11803146">In labor contracts, there is a difference between laying a man off and terminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.494" offset="11833344">You terminate him when you fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.839" offset="11838777">Then you discharge him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.356" offset="11844838">On the other hand, when you don't have any work for him, you lay him off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.690" offset="11858108">And this distinction is carried out in this contract, laid-off the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.836" offset="11882768">That is employees who are on a layoff status are entitled to vacation pay if they have worked enough in the prior year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.109" offset="11911816">They've accrued of the employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.786" offset="11922474">The same light goes to their certain pension rights and certain insurance rights to employees who are laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.732" offset="11946297">The question in this case was whether in a contract which provided that employees could be terminated after they've been laid off for 18 months or they would be terminated if they quit or they were discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.397" offset="12008991">The employer, when he decided that there wasn't any work for them and that there wouldn't be any work for them had the right to terminate them, cutting off their rights or that they stayed on the layoff status and accrued whatever rights the parties agreed in their contract, laid-off employees should have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.409" offset="12080985">And that's the -- that was the only question which the union sought to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.028" offset="12091434">We didn't want to keep this fellow in business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.436" offset="12097076">We recognize that these are perfectly right on the management clause to shut up anytime he wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.264" offset="12116407">All we want to do is have our employees continue to have the rights they would have had if he laid them all off and said, "I have no work for you for 18 months."</text>

            <label>Mr. David E. Feller</label>
            <text syncTime="3017.198" offset="12172204">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.184" offset="12180146">These are accrued rights which laid-off employees have and which we think these employees were entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.990" offset="12203342">Now, the next question I'd like to address myself to is the question which arose in many of the prior arguments as to the -- of relationship between -- we'll put it this way, perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.419" offset="12269066">What Congress was trying to do in section 301 as far as we can determine it from the authoritative legislative materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.346" offset="12308773">And the relationship between the agreement to arbitrate and the agreement not to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.865" offset="12330820">Preliminary to that comment, I think, it's perfectly plain that not only are there only 15 States as far as we know which enforce executory agreements to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.646" offset="12365928">But I don't think only seven of them applied that to -- to labor contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.921" offset="12383065">So that in the great majority of States, it's a matter of state law, and I can't say that I read the cases in all these States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.436" offset="12409083">I'm just citing a secondary authority but in most of these States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.456" offset="12429145">With the exception of seven, agreements to arbitrate future disputes are not enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.427" offset="12465089">What this means is, that a union which agrees not to strike, and typical language in a collective bargaining agreement, now there -- there are simply hundreds in which this -- this occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.029" offset="12515453">The union agrees that the employer has the right to manage the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.787" offset="12534471">He takes the actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.783" offset="12542516">He pays the wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.861" offset="12546800">He schedules the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.667" offset="12554010">He tells the people what they have to do and you have to do it if you work in the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.750" offset="12570415">You can't say this is contrary to the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.770" offset="12586402">You have to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.305" offset="12592567">And the only protection which the union has in these cases is to either you can shut it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.702" offset="12614196">You have a strike on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.249" offset="12620361">That's the old fashioned way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.397" offset="12624959">That's the way it used to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.740" offset="12634363">That was the kind of case you had in Westinghouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.756" offset="12642408">That was the kind of contract you had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.271" offset="12652440">You could strike on a question of interpretation and application of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.880" offset="12670934">The employer didn't pay as he was supposed to in the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.982" offset="12687339">If he didn't schedule the people, if he didn't provide safe conditions, if he didn't do any of the things which the collective bargaining agreement required him to do, the Union could call a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.033" offset="12727463">Today, in better than 90% of collecting bargaining agreements have their differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.672" offset="12746062">They have a contract which says there shall be no strikes during the term of this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.289" offset="12768528">But all questions of interpretation and application of the agreement shall be settled in accordance with the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.854" offset="12794755">The Lincoln Mills case, as a matter of fact, they put a right on the same clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.636" offset="12805935">It says no-strikes arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.012" offset="12815444">That was the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.878" offset="12818892">No-strike arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.114" offset="12827878">Now, we come to 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.016" offset="12839476">Irrespective of what the Congress intended, the federal courts to device seniority law or overtime law, and I don't think they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.719" offset="12870196">There is one thing that I think they clearly, and that is that if you have one of these clauses in a contract and there was a strike, the union ought to be sued for damages and ought to collect in the federal court, irrespective of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.291" offset="12924531">I could wish it were otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.606" offset="12929755">I'm sure all unions would prefer it otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.211" offset="12940204">But the Senate Committee was particularly explicit on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.173" offset="12956087">It said the whole purpose of a collective bargaining arrangement is to ensure industrial peace for the life of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.861" offset="12990777">And they repeated that again and again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.905" offset="13003003">And then they said, now, one of the problems here is suing unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.646" offset="13017945">That's what they were faced with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.261" offset="13024423">But this problem was a procedural problem basically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.924" offset="13035081">Though I will say it's not only a procedural problem, it's a substantive problem in some States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.172" offset="13056084">Therefore, we said we'll not be able to allow you to sue these unions as entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.791" offset="13074578">And this was provided in 301 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.422" offset="13089102">That when you get a union in court, you'll treat it as an entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.821" offset="13106657">You can -- you have jurisdiction over it where its offices are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.152" offset="13120031">They provided how they should be served what I -- but then they said, “How you're going to get them in court?</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.117" offset="13139884">You've got to have a federal cause of action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.830" offset="13150647">And they pointed out in the Senate Committee and I'm paraphrasing the Senate Committee report, I think, that it would -- extreme faithfulness as far as I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.463" offset="13181262">They said there are no federal laws giving either an employer or even the Government any right of action against the union for a breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.452" offset="13217207">Thus, there is no, their own quote, "substantive right" to enforce in order to make the union sueable as such in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.952" offset="13255137">Then they proceeded to the proposition that if to get them into the federal courts, they would have to make this a federal statutory cause of action and they said that's a fine thing, anyhow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.945" offset="13307173">They said statute -- and this is again a quote from the Senate Committee report, “Statutory recognition of the collective agreement as a valid, binding, and enforceable contract is a logical and necessary step.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.614" offset="13365791">It will promote a higher degree of responsibility upon the parties to such agreements and will thereby promote industrial peace.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.703" offset="13402154">Well, this is from the Senate Committee report on section 301, which is virtually the statute which the Senate version was adapted by the House and which was virtually what statute we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.025" offset="13451473">Now, concededly, they focused entirely on the cases where unions broke these promises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.931" offset="13479058">That the method of policing the contract would be through the grievance machinery and not by a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.041" offset="13503509">Obviously, if the strike says, you can strike, you can strike, if the contract said so.</text>
