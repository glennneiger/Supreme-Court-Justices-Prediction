            <text syncTime="496.539" offset="2089566">That was as an important factor in the court below, but it has been narrowed, so that it's no longer necessary to go into the conspiracy angle of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.534" offset="2117465">Now, it is sufficient, we believe, to sustain the Government's case, to sustain that this stock relationship between the du Pont Corporation and General Motors is -- is a combination which exercises an influence by nature of -- of the stock ownership, whereby, trade which would ordinarily go to this firm and that firm on basis of free competition is now channeled to the du Pont Corporation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.611" offset="2237837">This does not occur because there are specific instructions that the trade should go then.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.456" offset="2257168">It may not happen all the time, but it happens a great deal of the time and sufficient of the trade has been channeled to du Pont, so that we believe there has been a material restraint on commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.684" offset="2318085">We are dealing here with -- with giants in the American corporate field.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.478" offset="2341282">General Motors last year, had gross sales of $12,000,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.763" offset="2362389">They had a net profit of over $1,000,000,000 and the dividends that flowed to du Pont amounted to a $135,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.412" offset="2408991">Du Pont, on the other hand, is the largest of the American Chemical Corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.727" offset="2434278">It had sales last year of nearly $2,000,000,000 and profits of about $431,000,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.419" offset="2473044">The magnitude of these corporations is relevant in an antitrust case.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.894" offset="2490911">Not because size by itself is -- is illegal, but because size carries with it the potentiality of -- of abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.322" offset="2540648">I like the quotation from Colepeper back in 1640 in the debate on the British Monopoly Law, where he said, “These men, like the frogs of Egypt, have got possession of our dwellings and we have scarce a room free from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.420" offset="2617031">They sup in our cup, they dip in our dish.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.574" offset="2629674">They sit by our fire.”</text>
            <text syncTime="635.010" offset="2643362">Now, there's one more point I would like to make before I turn to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.393" offset="2672933">There occur -- there reoccurs throughout the briefs of the appellees, the suggestion that this course of business or that course of business, did not hurt General Motors or was for the general benefit of General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.567" offset="2729671">Now, I want to be clear that I am not arguing that anything that was done in this situation has hurt General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.295" offset="2760600">We are not concerned with -- with whether or not General Motors prospered in spite of or because of this combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.105" offset="2799783">We are concerned here with whether or not there has been free competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.184" offset="2820159">The Congress of the United States has said that, “The rule of our economic life shall be an absence of restraints on trade.”</text>
            <text syncTime="686.907" offset="2850983">And we are concerned here not with the welfare of -- of General Motors or du Pont but with whether or not this is consistent with the -- the antitrust policy which has been established by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.390" offset="2908975">In discussing the facts, I -- I shall try to divide them into three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.356" offset="2928828">In the first place, I shall discuss the evidence which deals with whether or not du Pont acquired control of General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.527" offset="2969475">In the second part, I shall discuss whether or not they had an intent to restrain trade when they made their investment in General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.597" offset="3013778">And in the third part, I shall discuss whether or not, this preference in the trade has in fact materialized.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.270" offset="3056410">This case started back in December of 1917.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.115" offset="3075845">At that time, the du Pont Corporation had accumulated very large earnings from its munitions business during World War I.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.704" offset="3114193">The question arose whether these earnings should be distributed to the stockholders or whether they should be retained in the corporation in order that the corporation might maintain its -- its earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.681" offset="3166124">Now, at this time there were some in the management of -- of the du Pont Corporation who were personally interested in General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.424" offset="3201024">Principally, there was Mr. John J. Raskob.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.525" offset="3213458">He was the treasurer of the du Pont Corporation, and Mr. Pierre S. du Pont, who was at that time president of the du Pont Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.157" offset="3255986">They had personal investments in General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.632" offset="3273853">The president of General Motors at this time was Mr. William C. Durant.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.304" offset="3292557">Mr. Durant had put the company together back in 1908, and after some problems with his bankers, he was back in control of the company in 1917.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.219" offset="3344280">Mr. Durant suggested to Mr. Raskob and Mr. Pierre S. du Pont that the du Pont Corporation or the du Pont, he wasn't too specific about it, form a partnership with Mr. Durant to control General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.945" offset="3427140">His thought was that he, Mr. Durant, would remain responsible for the financial affairs of the Corporation, and that the du Ponts should take over the financial responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.817" offset="3482624">It was contemplated that du Pont would invest in the neighborhood of $25,000,000 in the stock of General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.780" offset="3526510">That was made explicitly clear, that between them, Mr. Durant and Mr. du Pont should -- and the -- and the du Pont Company would control General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.013" offset="3567470">I say this because we have, as a primary exhibit in this case, exhibit -- Government Exhibit 124, the material portions, which for this purpose are reprinted at page 9 and 10 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.276" offset="3632462">Mr. Raskob, after hearing Mr. Durant's proposal, prepared a memorandum summarizing the proposal and the effects of the purchases, in order to lay this proposition before the governing committees of the du Pont Corporation, the finance committee and the executive committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.230" offset="3728280">In this memorandum, he summarized -- I appointed -- printed in our brief the -- the summary of the -- of the reasons for purchasing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.554" offset="3761612">On page 9 he says, “Summarizing the above, we have an opportunity to make a substantial investment in the motor industry with the following points in favor thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.932" offset="3815111">One, with Mr. Durant, we will have joint control of the companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.124" offset="3839875">Two, we are immediately to assume charge and be responsible for the financial operation of the company."</text>
            <text syncTime="943.217" offset="3876237">Skipping through to page 10, about halfway down where it speaks of management.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.177" offset="3900061">"Perhaps it is not made clear that the directorates of the motor companies will be chosen by du Pont and Durant.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.200" offset="3936214">Mr. Durant would be continued as the president of the Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.111" offset="3947813">Mr. P. S. du Pont would be continued as Chairman of the Board, the finance committee will be ours", and by ours, he means du Pont because he's addressing this to the du Pont committee."</text>
            <text syncTime="971.752" offset="3990340">The finance committee will be ours and we will have such representation on the executive committee as we desire.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.776" offset="4018448">And it is the writers belief, that ultimately, the du Pont Company will absolutely control and dominate the whole General Motors situation, with the entire approval of Mr. Durant, who I think will eventually place his holdings with us taking his payment, therefore, in some securities mutually satisfactory."</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.491" offset="4113324">The executive committee and the finance committee approved the purchase of this stock on the basis of this memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.110" offset="4139760">This memorandum was again read to the Board of Directors itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.513" offset="4161390">This is in December of 1917.And the Board of Directors, having heard this memorandum, also approved the purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.827" offset="4202663">It went through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.613" offset="4205798">They bought 250,000 shares of the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.359" offset="4224815">It amounted to about 23% of the stock even in those days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.627" offset="4245922">Within the next two years they increased their -- their investment to about $48,000,000 and their percentage of control rose to 28%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.069" offset="4283643">And pursuant to the agreement with Mr. Durant, the du Pont representatives were elected to the Board of Directors and to the committees, and the partnership became effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.423" offset="4329096">Now, it's about three years after this, in 1920 that Mr. Durant got into trouble by over extending himself on the stock market in supporting General Motors stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.719" offset="4374235">He was in grave danger of -- of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.260" offset="4392417">The du Pont Corporation took over, paid off his loans, and took over his stock themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.541" offset="4425540">Thus, it was late in the -- in 1920 that du Pont became the holder of 38% of the General Motors stock, with an investment of $75,000,000 and Mr. Durant was out of the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.569" offset="4481651">Mr. Pierre S. du Pont was --</text>

            <text syncTime="1107.180" offset="4532120">It's about three years after the original purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.495" offset="4549360">Mr. Pierre S. du Pont became president of General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.249" offset="4568377">Du Pont nominees took a majority of the positions on both the executive committee and the finance committee of General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.269" offset="4604426">Now, speaking of the interlocking directorates, which commence back in this time, it's noteworthy to, right in the beginning to notice that Mr. Pierre du Pont, served as Chairman of the Board of both du Pont and General Motors, continually from 1919 until 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.726" offset="4698258">And when he retired from the Chairmanship of the General Motors Board, his brother, Mr. Lammot du Pont, who was then president of the du Pont Corporation, proceeded to take over as Chairman of the -- of the General Motors Board and he held the position from 1929 until 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.952" offset="4775163">Now, this isn't the only connection between the two corporations, but when the Chairman of the Board of the Corporation is closely tied in to the du Pont as -- as this situation shows, we -- we don't have really any question but there is a close interlocking of the directorates of the two corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.106" offset="4855829">It was also during this early period that the man who really bridges the span from the early days to -- to the present days came into the picture, namely, Mr. Alfred P. Sloan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.520" offset="4905462">Mr. Alfred P. Sloan was in the General Motors setup before the du Ponts bought in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.318" offset="4928658">He had been the president of the United Motors Corporation, which was a manufacturer of automobile parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.912" offset="4959065">And it had been made a part -- and that Corporation had been made a part of General Motors while Mr. Durant was president.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.856" offset="4986755">Mr. Sloan had come with the corporation and become a vice president of -- vice president of General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.148" offset="5019982">But when in 1923, Mr. Pierre S. du Pont decided to step down as president, it was he -- it was he who recommended that his successor should be Mr. Alfred P. Sloan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.863" offset="5074840">Now, the court below and the appellees in their briefs, based a good deal of their argument with respect to the independence of General Motors upon the independence of Mr. Sloan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.177" offset="5132100">And it seems clear to -- it seems clear that Mr. Sloan was certainly not a yes man in any sense of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.977" offset="5167313">It's also equally clear, that he was originally picked for his position as Chief Executive by Mr. Pierre S. du Pont himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.842" offset="5202735">Mr. Raskob wrote, we have done a splendid job in electing Alfred, president of General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.459" offset="5237217">And within two weeks after he was elected president of General Motors, he was elected the Director of the du Pont Corporation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.747" offset="5274311">He was richly compensated under the General Motors bonus plans, the allotments of which -- under which were primarily responsibility of -- of du Pont connected personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.110" offset="5339826">Moreover, Mr. Sloan is the man who in 1926, wrote a letter to Mr. Irenee du Pont, then president of the du Pont Corporation saying, “You must recognize that I am essentially or at least, believe and hope I am, a member of the du Pont family.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.184" offset="5452152">I don't mean that Mr. -- Mr. Sloan was a nominee of the -- of the du Pont's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.538" offset="5469497">He came up through the management but there's no question that he was placed in his position, rewarded, promoted in his position, and rewarded by the du Ponts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.953" offset="5523205">And he -- he could not help but have known and trusted them and have been inclined to -- to favor them whenever a choice arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.649" offset="5561971">As to -- as to actual nominees on the du Pont Board, I'd like to call the Court's attention to appendix B to our main brief, starting at page 154, where we have reprinted a General Motors exhibit, which lists throughout the years the du Pont nominees on the General Motors Board, that generally amount to about six, sometimes only five in later years, five or six directors, specifically nominees of the du Pont Corporation, of the du Pont Company, but one should not be mislead by the terms, management and du Pont, over this list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.061" offset="5771577">The fact that a man is listed under the management list, doesn't necessarily mean that he has no connections with the -- with the du Pont Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.496" offset="5809403">They list under management, such men as -- as Mr. Brown who appears in several of these lists as a management director, and yet, Mr. Brown was with du Pont long before he was with General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.671" offset="5870007">He remained with du Pont after he went to General Motors, and I believe is -- he's now listed as a du Pont representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.395" offset="5904906">These men in the management were in many cases, placed there and promoted by -- by the du Ponts themselves, and one shouldn't think that we have the management as against du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.286" offset="5952554">They are really allies rather than opponents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.228" offset="5976273">Now, in addition to this situation of interlocking directorates and these committee positions, the committees -- the important committees are also listed in this exhibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.476" offset="6029249">Following, they show the members of the executive committee, the finance committee with the personnel which is involved, so that one can trace the du Pont personnel through the committee setup.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.061" offset="6075643">In addition to -- to these methods of making control effective, an important feature in securing the loyalty of the General Motors personnel were the bonus plans, which were sponsored by the du Pont Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.492" offset="6153383">The most important of these and the first, was the managers' securities plan, which was initiated shortly after Mr. Pierre S. du Pont left the presidency of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.281" offset="6200508">He suggested when he left, that there should be a distribution of sale to the executives of General Motors of the stock which du Pont had acquired from Mr. Durant, about $25,000,000 worth of stock which they had taken over at the time they paid his debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.023" offset="6275427">This stock was to be sold on an installment plan to the executives of the General Motors Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.003" offset="6311372">It had -- this installment plan of purchase had -- had two benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.385" offset="6328926">In the first place, it enabled the du Pont Corporation to retain the voting power of the stock until sometime in the mid-1930's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.468" offset="6369259">And in the second place, it made it easy for these executives to buy the stock and the -- the profits which they made from this plan are fabulous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.490" offset="6409383">We list on page 27 of our brief, a -- a short table which shows how much these executives profited in the -- in the first few years of holding the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.557" offset="6465599">Mr. Sloan, for example, subscribed to $80,000 worth of stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.761" offset="6502379">This was in 1923 and 1924.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.872" offset="6510843">By 1926, his stock was worth $2,154,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.788" offset="6542503">And it became even more valuable by 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.015" offset="6555460">Mr. Raskob, placed the value of $20,000,000 on his stock in 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.687" offset="6586075">I'm not suggesting that the loyalties of these business executives were for sale, and I'm not suggesting that the people who made these allotments of these bonuses, considered whether or not the directors purchased enough paint and fabric from du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.759" offset="6674369">What I am suggesting is that the individuals could not help but be well-disposed towards the people who held their -- who were the source of so much wealth, it -- it's inevitable that they must have -- must have felt kindly towards the du Pont people who were making it possible for them to -- to prosper so -- so extravagantly.</text>

            <text syncTime="2902.635" offset="11713912">We -- we come to the second question and that is the intent with which du Pont purchased this interest in -- in General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.712" offset="11758216">And this is important because there's nothing illegal per se in -- in one corporation controlling another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.408" offset="11796982">It is only when that relationship is used as an instrument to affect an illegal restraint or where it is intended to effect an illegal restraint and it falls outside the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.259" offset="11852361">Now obviously, there's some artificiality in talking about the intent of a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.648" offset="11881932">A corporation has no mind of its own and -- and so strictly speaking the corporation as such doesn't intend anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.756" offset="11918399">But what we are talking about is the -- really the collective intention of -- of the Board of Directors which directed and authorized this purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.111" offset="11963852">And the Board of Directors in this case acted upon the recommendation of the two important committees, the Finance Committee and the Executive Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.290" offset="11996557">Now, there's no transcript of the discussion which took place in those committees, I don't suppose any was made at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.465" offset="12033233">Necessarily, the recollection of those who were present was dimmed by the passage of some 35 years but fortunately the record in this case provides us with the memorandum, the -- the prospectors -- prospectors as it were, which Mr. Rascob laid before the committees when they acted upon this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.359" offset="12136782">This is committee -- the Government Exhibit 124 which I referred to a few minutes ago and I refer to it again because I think that this is very nearly conclusive on what the intent of the corporation was at the time it made its investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.833" offset="12210657">Mr. Rascob prepared this memorandum and it was reviewed by Mr. Pierre S. du Pont before it went to the committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.522" offset="12237511">And then it had to be summarized -- the reasons for making the purchase and he summarized them as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.840" offset="12262693">Summarizing the above, we have an opportunity to make a substantial investment in the motor industry with the following points in favor thereof.</text>

            <text syncTime="3062.991" offset="12355375">"Our interest in the General Motors Company will undoubtedly secure for us the entire Fabrikoid, Pyralin paint and varnish business of those companies, which is a substantial factor."</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.978" offset="12427264">The -- the court below in referring to this memorandum said this is a forecast by Mr. Rascob, he thought that this would happen but that doesn't show anything about intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.016" offset="12483480">Well, I respectfully suggest to the Court that when the governing Boards of du Pont voted on a proposition, it was laid before them in writing and one of the purposes, one of the aims of making the purchases set out to obtain this business there's more than a forecast.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.869" offset="12562892">It is in that case that it is a proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.891" offset="12570937">They -- they were voting on whether or not they wished to buy the stock in order to acquire this business and they voted in favor of buying the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.315" offset="12612629">And when they reported to their stockholders in 1917 and 1918, they made reference to the fact that they had purchased the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.762" offset="12646379">In their reports to the stockholders, they called to their attention that the General Motors Corporation and du Pont -- the General Motors Corporation did a big business in the -- in the products which du Pont manufactured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.334" offset="12716701">I think this -- these prospectors if you please, on what they were doing in 1917 is much more important than the present recollection of the -- of the people who were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.029" offset="12775528">Mr. Pierre S. du Pont and Mr. Irenee du Pont testified during the trial and they said that as far they were concerned, they didn't think about the trade at the time they purchased the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.708" offset="12826206">They said that they didn't remember that there was any discussion of the trade at the -- and before the meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.550" offset="12853582">Well I don't -- I don't question -- I don't question their honesty in this mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.025" offset="12883466">I -- I think -- I do suggest that 35 years may dim memory but whether or not they're entirely honest on it, still it seems to me that the written record, the contemporaneous record which was made at the time after the purchase of -- of the -- of purpose of the purchase is more important than present recollection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.094" offset="12955773">And I suggest to the Court that as far as the intent of the purchase we can rest our case entirely on -- on Government Exhibit 124.</text>

            <text syncTime="4576.673" offset="18410036">Then he mentioned the current dispute which was -- had arisen about whether alcohol or glycerine was the preferable mixture to be used as an antifreeze in -- in automobile radiators.</text>
            <text syncTime="4588.810" offset="18458624">And he wrote as follows, and I quote his letter, "The Kentucky Alcohol Corporation inquires whether the General Motors Corporation is giving their official approval to publicity, favoring glycerine rather than alcohol.</text>
            <text syncTime="4605.871" offset="18526856">If so, it is suggested that their attention be called to the interest which the du Pont Company will have in the future in its manufacture and sale."</text>
            <text syncTime="4617.146" offset="18571995">Mr. Sloan wrote back and he said, "We can't take sides in a matter like this as to which is the best product to be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="4625.976" offset="18607313">We have to go upon the facts."</text>
            <text syncTime="4628.756" offset="18618389">Nevertheless, there were three of the divisions of -- of General Motors, Chevrolet, Buick and Cadillac, which were all recommending glycerine as an antifreeze in their instruction books.</text>
            <text syncTime="4642.926" offset="18675127">And all three of these companies -- well, two of them began to recommend alcohol and the other took a neutral position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4653.501" offset="18717341">And the important thing about this is that at the very time they took this position, the research people in General Motors were firmly of the position that Prestone was the preferable antifreeze.</text>

            <text syncTime="4675.072" offset="18803649">At the -- there's in -- in -- referred to in my brief, there are a series of letters on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4680.145" offset="18823920">The way it ends up is that Mr. Sloan said -- said, "We've decided to follow up policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.615" offset="18845863">What we'll do is to include in our instruction books a fair statement as to, which to you, as to the advantages of each" and the fair statement was like this, "Alcohol is -- is cheaper but if it's spilled on -- on the surface, on the -- on the finish, it will mark it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4707.325" offset="18932694">Glycerine is more expensive and if used strictly in accord with the manufacture's instructions, it is satisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4715.394" offset="18964982">But if -- if the connections aren't tight, it will eat out the engine and it may clog the radiator.</text>
            <text syncTime="4723.779" offset="18998523">And this at the time that General Motors was itself using solely glycerine in its cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="4732.478" offset="19033318">As I say, money-wise, it isn't important but from a point of view of showing the -- the influence of a stock relationship in this kind of a business, I think it is highly significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4745.686" offset="19086085">Far more significant in terms of money is the lead, the tetraethyl lead picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="4755.213" offset="19124224">Lead is a compound which -- tetraethyl lead is a compound, which today is added to gasoline to improve its performance in internal combustion engines.</text>
            <text syncTime="4766.978" offset="19171244">The discovery of this substance was made by two General Motors inventors, a Dr. Midgley and Mr. Kettering.</text>
            <text syncTime="4778.668" offset="19218056">It'd be hard to overemphasize the importance of this discovery at the time it was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4784.633" offset="19241880">It was immediately recognized by both du Pont and General Motors that the addition of lead to the gasoline would tremendously improve its performance and it was a very important thing in the automobile industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4798.844" offset="19298722">Now, du Pont had no facilities at this time for manufacturing tetraethyl lead.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.965" offset="19319202">Nobody had manufactured tetraethyl lead up to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4806.669" offset="19330069">It was a -- it was a laboratory product.</text>
            <text syncTime="4810.627" offset="19345847">It's interesting the -- the extreme informality which -- with which this invention was turned over for development by General Motors to du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="4822.507" offset="19393390">The first manufactured by du Pont for General Motors was done without any contract at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4828.241" offset="19416377">Later on, a formal contract was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.082" offset="19427662">Now, the court below found that Mr. Kettering was responsible for bringing du Pont into the picture and some emphasis was placed on the point of view that Mr. Kettering had no -- no allegiance to du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.196" offset="19480116">Well, actually, of course, it was far too important a matter for Mr. Kettering himself to decide and the records shows that Mr. Sloan certainly participated in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4853.640" offset="19517942">And the final contract, the contract which turned the development of this tremendously important substance over to du Pont was signed by Mr. Pierre S. du Pont for General Motors and Mr. Irenee du Pont for the du Pont Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4872.141" offset="19591920">And du Pont proceeded thereupon to be the sole manufacturer of tetraethyl lead for distribution through what was called the Ethyl Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4885.986" offset="19647300">Now, the Ethyl Corporation was formed by a combination of Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, which had had a patent for the manufacture of this material which was much cheaper than the way du Pont had done it and General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4901.277" offset="19708531">They each owned -- Standard Oil of New Jersey and General Motors each owned one-half of the stock of this distributing corporation and they bought all of their lead from du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="4913.029" offset="19755447">General -- Standard of New Jersey was quite anxious in the early days to get into the production of this material.</text>
            <text syncTime="4919.983" offset="19783346">It's interesting that Mr. Sloan for General Motors and the du Ponts stood firm against letting any competition in on -- on the production.</text>
            <text syncTime="4929.841" offset="19822738">Now, it's asserted that this was a dangerous product and indeed it was dangerous product, and that only -- and that only du Pont who was accustomed to handling dangerous things could -- could do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4941.770" offset="19870490">And to support this -- this view with the appellees point to the fact that Standard Oil had a pilot plant and that eight people were -- eight people were killed through lead poisoning, through their experimentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4957.731" offset="19934333">What they don't point out is that the only way to learn how to manufacture this stuff was by manufacturing it and that a larger number of people were actually -- contracted lead poisoning and died in the -- in the du Pont manufacture than did the in the Standard Oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="4973.360" offset="19996818">Anyway, throughout the years, until the patents ran out, the exclusive manufacturer of this material was the du Pont Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4984.565" offset="20041644">And they made in all, $86,000,000 in gross sales of -- of tetraethyl lead to -- to the Ethyl Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4994.767" offset="20082395">Perhaps, it was good business for General Motors to turn the manufacture of this over to a chemical company and very likely du Pont was well equipped to -- to do this manufacturing for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5007.586" offset="20133700">But the important thing in this picture is not that they did it but the way almost automatically happened and the way the -- the parties assumed that this -- this was in du Pont's field and no one else should -- should stand in the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5023.698" offset="20198170">At one time, Mr. Sloan wrote -- put in writing this statement, du Pont will always be the manufacturing agents of Ethyl Gasoline Corporation, whether we make tetraethyl lead or whatever we make, now or in the future.</text>

            <text syncTime="5085.075" offset="20443721">After du Pont had been manufacturing this for a series of years and after the -- the accidents occurred, there was an attempt to -- to get a -- it wasn't really by the du Pont Company but the president of -- of the Ethyl Company thought that he should negotiate to see if he could get a second source of supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.226" offset="20524283">Now, there's no indication that du Pont would have gone along with this if it had been successful and he approached one or two other chemical companies attempting to see whether they would be interested in providing this themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="5117.425" offset="20573080">Nothing happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="5675.416" offset="22805086">At the outset, I should like to say just a word about the Government's approach to the findings of fact in this case and our attitude toward that approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="5690.948" offset="22867153">The Government, of course, attacks, as I think you can see from their very convenient document, all of the important findings that the trial court made on the three issues which Mr. Davis has stated as roughly the issue of control, the issue of intent, and the issue of restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="5713.547" offset="22957537">Now, the Government in its brief in here characterizes those findings in some different ways and I'm not going to quarrel over terminology.</text>
            <text syncTime="5722.489" offset="22993377">I just want to say that I don't think it makes any difference whether you call them basic or conclusions or ultimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5729.075" offset="23019708">They're still findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5732.108" offset="23031829">They're a distillation from the record and they are a distillation from a very large body of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5740.121" offset="23063907">And I also should like to observe at this point that it seems to us that those, there are two things to be said about the Government's attack on those findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5750.927" offset="23107062">In the first place, we do not agree that its attack is consistent with the findings which it does not attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="5759.642" offset="23141961">I will enforce my argument, I think to point to the two or three -- four important instances where what they argue now is inconsistent with findings that they have accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5772.113" offset="23191803">The other observation I should like to make is that in one side, the trial court I think did put in the opinion and findings most of the things which he regarded as significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5785.898" offset="23246973">But in throughout the opinion, particularly when he reaches a finding, which requires the consideration of a large body of evidence, the trial court makes it perfectly clear that the findings are not necessarily self-sufficient or self-contained.</text>
            <text syncTime="5803.984" offset="23319280">He repeatedly says, I find this on the whole record or I find this on all of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5811.990" offset="23351359">And when you consider how that he heard this case, listened to the testimony and the witnesses for nearly seven months and at the end of that seven months, after full briefing, there was an argument that lasted 11 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="5828.533" offset="23417501">The kind of paradise for counsel in which the facts were fully discussed to the trial judge, you could understand why he approached the problem in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5839.333" offset="23460655">There is one other thing I want to say just so this case, the facts can be viewed in the proper context.</text>
            <text syncTime="5847.628" offset="23493883">Before this, the Government brought this case, there was a full and complete investigation by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5856.274" offset="23528469">The du Pont Company cooperated with that investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5860.125" offset="23543829">They came in and we voluntarily opened our files.</text>
            <text syncTime="5863.238" offset="23556368">There was no -- except for privilege document of the counsel, there was no withholding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5868.202" offset="23576221">They copied and took away about 3000 documents and then after that they had a grand jury proceeding, and purchasing agents of General Motors, and officers, and officials of both General Motors and du Pont testified before that grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5884.829" offset="23642676">And we supplied them with information to the grand jury and quite properly as they should.</text>
            <text syncTime="5890.102" offset="23663783">They used some of that information in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5893.059" offset="23675591">Now, the only thing I want to say about that is that I think this Court can be sure that when they went in to the District Court in this case, they had in their possession every fact that the apparatus of the Federal Government could get forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5907.027" offset="23731493">They had everything and they made the best possible case they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="5911.894" offset="23750928">Now, with those preliminary remarks, I think that I should like to address myself at once to the question which seems to me is -- is really crucial on this case and I put it very simply, and that's the question of what has happened or what did happen in the 34 years that this relationship existed?</text>
            <text syncTime="5931.523" offset="23829504">Was there a restraint of trade?</text>
            <text syncTime="5933.815" offset="23838595">Did du Pont get a noncompetitive preferential advantage when it dealt with General Motors in its commercial relation?</text>
            <text syncTime="5941.877" offset="23870882">That seems to me what this case is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="5944.905" offset="23883003">If it -- if on the facts there was no such preferential advantage, it seems to me that these arguments about intent and control certainly have far less significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5957.213" offset="23932217">But one thing just as an evidentiary matter, as Mr. Davis has quite candidly said.</text>
            <text syncTime="5961.970" offset="23951235">If in 34 years, you can't prove any realization of the intent or any exercise of the power, that's pretty strong evidence that it didn't exist anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="5973.286" offset="23996479">So that -- that -- it is to that aspect in the case and to the findings which the trial court made on that aspect of the case that I should like to address myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5984.179" offset="24040051">And I should like also to say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5987.248" offset="24052381">I think anyone coming to this case and looking simply at the two companies and looking at the stock relationship, seeing the people on the Board of Directors and on the committees, and then looking at the volume of purchases, I think it's quite natural for someone to say, "Well, there must be some relationship between those two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="6007.063" offset="24131584">It just -- just seems reasonable.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6009.731" offset="24142346">But that, I remind the Court is a question of fact and because we might approach that case, anyone I think, naturally and humanly might approach that case with that preconception, for that is what it would be, a preconception based on all of the fact or part of the fact, does not change the problem which is involved, which is the problem of looking at all the facts and seeing whether that first impression or that preconception, as I think it is, natural preconception is really true and that is what was done in this case at great length and in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="6049.036" offset="24299499">Huge slice of life in his record, 34 years of it, the trial court made its findings on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6058.590" offset="24337742">The evidence in the limits of an appellate argument is not really capable of being dealt with in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="6067.089" offset="24371702">I shall have to summarize it but there are some general things I should like to say before I try to deal with some aspects of it, including this matter of the volume of sale, that I should in some general things I should like to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="6082.106" offset="24431783">The one which is most important in understanding the case and understanding the situation is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6088.067" offset="24455607">Since 1922, General Motors has operated on a decentralized basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6096.700" offset="24490193">That means that except for matters which involve the investment of substantial amounts of capital in all other, in operating matters, each division is autonomous.</text>
            <text syncTime="6108.304" offset="24536586">It makes its own decisions about -- particularly about what it will buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="6114.002" offset="24559365">So that when I speak as I shall or when Mr. Davis speaks of the totality of General Motors purchases, what we're talking about is a result that is achieved by separate and independent decisions made by purchasing agents in the various decisions -- divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6133.354" offset="24636792">We're not speaking about a decision made by small group of men in the central office of General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="6141.940" offset="24671169">Now, there was a short period of time in the 1920s, when there was a central purchasing committee, which in the case of certain commodities and under certain conditions did some central purchasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6154.260" offset="24720384">The Government has now abandoned the contentions that it made about that committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="6158.690" offset="24738147">It no longer challenges the trial court's findings which are to the effect that that committee, that central purchasing committee dealt with du Pont just as it dealt with any other supplier.</text>
            <text syncTime="6170.225" offset="24784227">So that I think for the purposes of this -- what I have to say we can dispose -- dispense with as any further talk about the central purchasing committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="6179.306" offset="24820590">And it is because of this autonomy that in my description of the facts, I shall frequently speak of selling to a division instead of selling to General Motors, because that's what the way this business was operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="6191.990" offset="24871372">Now, with those -- with that fact leads to another fact, which I think is extremely important in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="6302.641" offset="25313886">But on the operations level, the divisions operated in an independent and autonomous way.</text>

            <text syncTime="6328.491" offset="25417331">Mr. Justice Reed, I frankly can't answer that question and I'm not sure that the record shows whether they would compete in that sense or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="6335.813" offset="25446588">They certainly competed in some areas in some ways in the sale of cars, in the market as you know but I don't -- sure the record shows what they did as to -- there is an interesting evidence that now, that you remind of it, that in early days at one time when there was a shortage of fabrics, they were sort of competing about which one could get fabrics from du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="6357.211" offset="25532165">But I -- I couldn't go beyond that in answering that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6363.887" offset="25558915">Now this -- this -- speaking very generally about the evidence as Mr. Davis, I think, quite candidly has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="6371.308" offset="25588590">There is ample and substantial evidence in this record that shows that these divisions have bought from du Pont and from other people on the basis of the ordinary business consideration, quality of product, service and price.</text>
            <text syncTime="6389.175" offset="25660061">And as you might expect, that same evidence shows that there has been a great diversity of purchases among the various divisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6399.074" offset="25699662">Some divisions will buy a product almost entirely from du Pont as Chevrolet does its paint.</text>
            <text syncTime="6405.957" offset="25727248">Other divisions won't buy that product from du Pont at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6408.854" offset="25738742">Oldsmobile buys very little paint for example from du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="6412.887" offset="25754937">Some of them will buy or one division will buy a commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6416.792" offset="25770506">There's a kind of paint called engine enamel, which Oldsmobile oddly enough buys from du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="6422.146" offset="25791927">No one else in General Motors buy that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6424.984" offset="25803316">They bought fabrics in different amounts and at different times.</text>
            <text syncTime="6428.606" offset="25817840">No -- no pattern at all came out of this, of -- of general survey of these purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6435.033" offset="25843545">That's all set forth in the findings of the -- of the trial judge, uncontested findings in large part.</text>
            <text syncTime="6441.891" offset="25870921">We think it is inconsistent with the Government's notion or assertion that this stock relationship in some way affected the sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="6450.639" offset="25905925">I say that particularly in view of the concessions that the Government has made about the way this relationship operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6458.340" offset="25936750">The Government has never contended that there was any overall direction about this thing from above.</text>
            <text syncTime="6463.692" offset="25958170">There was never any directive, no resolution from the Board of Directors, no resolutions from the top committees, nothing of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="6473.970" offset="25999235">And now the Government concedes and I think that it must that the salesmen and the purchasing agents didn't act on any basis of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="6482.254" offset="26032358">They testified and the Government takes their testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="6485.631" offset="26045942">You might almost get the impression that this restraint of trade is rather like a mist that this pervades everything but operates without the assistance of any human hands or any human mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="6498.499" offset="26097351">I don't think the Government really intends it's concession to go quite that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="6503.388" offset="26116890">But it does say that the -- that the inherent, any inheritable effect of the relationship was to poison these transactions, so that General Motors just must have favored du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="6521.807" offset="26190555">Now, when they put their point that way, I think they're under a heavy burden of explaining why a relationship that was said to be inherent and inevitable didn't operate in an inherent and inevitable way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6536.673" offset="26250115">Why it wasn't uniform, and constant, and continuing?</text>
            <text syncTime="6540.141" offset="26263907">Why was it that it would operate as to some commodities and not as to others?</text>
            <text syncTime="6544.282" offset="26280521">Why did it operate at one time in one way, and another time in a different way?</text>
            <text syncTime="6548.705" offset="26298180">Why did it operate as to some purchasing agents and not as to others?</text>
            <text syncTime="6552.805" offset="26314585">It seems to me you can't possibly reconcile this notion of the relationship and its effect as they have set it out with this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6562.759" offset="26354395">In their reply brief they -- they feel they have to deal with that problem and they say, well, when General Motors didn't buy from du Pont, that was just because du Pont really wasn't trying to sell to them or didn't really make an effort to exercise its influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6577.762" offset="26414373">Now, there are a number of troubles with that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="6581.078" offset="26427643">One of them is that there's an uncontested finding by the trial court that the documents indicate that du Pont was always interested in selling to General Motors to the extent of 100% of its requirements and there's another trouble which I think is even more difficult for the Government when they tried to prove intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6600.756" offset="26506428">This intent they speak of, the way they prove intent is by documents from the files of the du Pont company that show that du Pont was trying to sell everything it could and beside that we have all the testimony of the salesmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="6614.382" offset="26560867">We have a great deal, much documentary evidence in this case which the defendants, offered showing these constant efforts to sell, many of them unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="6624.288" offset="26600573">Now, with those general observations about the -- the -- but before I leave that, let me say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6633.995" offset="26639339">The Government attacks these purchases as being -- they -- they now say that they wanted it all bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="6640.482" offset="26665253">They don't tell us which ones exactly were bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="6642.945" offset="26675179">They suggest some part of the Duco sales were bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="6646.614" offset="26689808">They don't even say as I understand it that all of the Duco sales were bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="6651.691" offset="26710183">Those arguments if they could be justified on the facts, which they cannot, would raise some very difficult questions of law I think as to just what the status of this alleged restraint is but I don't want to talk about the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6665.376" offset="26764831">I want to talk about facts whether that -- whether they -- they can justify that kind of a finding of fact, which they say the trial court should have made.</text>
            <text syncTime="6674.761" offset="26802448">They did not bring forward any evidence in the District Court that related directly to these sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="6682.661" offset="26834004">They didn't bring forward any evidence that showed that General Motors could have bought things at the same time from anybody else that was good at the same price.</text>
            <text syncTime="6692.443" offset="26873187">They weren't able to find any disgruntled employee come in and testify about directions that he'd been given, and they were not able to find, and this I think very significant throughout this 34-year period, any past or present competitor of du Pont, or anybody operating in these various industries to come in and testify that General Motors had given du Pont some favor, or that he'd been handicapped in some way because of the stock relationship in trying to sell to General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="6725.507" offset="27005367">There's just isn't any evidence to that kind to counterbalance the affirmative evidence that we had put in the record, which the trial court took in his findings that these sales were made on merit, were made on the ordinary and unordinary business way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6740.582" offset="27065657">Instead, the Government has to fall back on this argument about the volume of sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="6748.015" offset="27095437">And it's the next thing I should like to talk about because it really is the only argument that the Government has to -- that has anything to do with these sales and it's a statistical argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="6759.120" offset="27139845">I think at the beginning that I should like to clarify one point that I think perhaps Mr. Davis inadvertently left in -- in some uncertainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="6769.821" offset="27182686">When he speaks of 98% of our sales being made to -- to General Motors, that figure is 90% of the sales of automotive paint made to automotive manufacturers for original application on automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="6794.626" offset="27281847">Now, that's not all the paint we sell to General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="6797.599" offset="27293759">We sell to General Motors paint for all purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6800.524" offset="27305462">We sell them paint for -- to put on parts of machinery, refrigerators, locomotives which they make, house paint, all sorts of paint.</text>
            <text syncTime="6813.456" offset="27357184">And we sell that kind of paint, the same kinds of paint to other people and when you compare the sales of the kinds of paint, all kinds of paint that General Motors make or that General Motors buys, which du Pont makes for General Motors, with the sales of the same kind of paint for the same purposes that are made by du Pont to everybody else, the percentage is not 90% it's about 20%.</text>
