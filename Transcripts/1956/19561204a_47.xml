            <text syncTime="45.081" offset="283669">The action here was brought against the respondent, United States against the Port Angeles and Western Railroad and against Fibreboard Products Company as joint tortfeasors.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.348" offset="340720">The case against the other joint tortfeasors is at issue in the District Court in Seattle awaiting outcome to this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.564" offset="377605">The complaint charges the Railroad with negligence in connection with the origin of the fire, charges Fibreboard with negligence in connection with the escape of the fire on September 20th and charges the respondent here with a series of negligent and concurrently negligent acts, 17 in all in connection with the origin, spread and final escape of the fire.</text>

            <text syncTime="111.297" offset="548551">Of facts and present claims, yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.117" offset="559835">The appeal here is to review a judgment on the pleadings there having been an answer filed by the Government in this case which was filed before the decision in the Dalehite case I might say, and then a judgment granted on the pleadings after the decision came down in the Dalehite case which a lower court decision was affirmed in the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.909" offset="658996">The petitioners here joined in and adopt the argument by Mr. Marion in Case Number 45.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.858" offset="690761">The complaint here briefly alleges that the fire started in the area owned by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.789" offset="726497">That the United States knew at the time of the combustible herbage, and old and rotten tires and had the right to abate the same but failed to require the abatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.887" offset="774875">The answer of the Government admits that it was the owner and alleges it notified the Railroad to remove these combustibles.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.735" offset="810297">The complaint also alleged that the U.S. both sold and traded in timber for a profit and managed and cared for its timberland where the fire started.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.372" offset="852825">The answer admits all of that allegation except it denied it acted for a profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.886" offset="878947">Now, the Government filed a cross-complaint in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.357" offset="892844">They asked judgment over against the Railroad for everything found to be due to these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.694" offset="918131">They asked for a judgment against the Railroad for $1,318,000 for lost timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.964" offset="943208">They asked for a judgment of $104,458 for wildlife and $140,070 for fighting the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.683" offset="986154">This is not a noble or an unprecedented action in the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.153" offset="1007992">The State of Washington's and Oregon, four states, there had been numerous cases of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.620" offset="1045817">Private individuals, private corporations and municipal corporations if you please, have been held liable under the exact state of facts set out in these -- in this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.308" offset="1108616">These cases and by the way the case law has been pretty well codified in Washington and also in Oregon today, these cases hold that there is a duty on a landowner to keep his premises in such condition as not to invite fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.182" offset="1196074">And secondly, that if a fire does result from any cause, this includes trespassers from any cause, then the landowner must use due care to ex -- due care to extinguish this fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.519" offset="1281442">There's a series of statutes -- that -- that are codified these rules of due care which are set out in our -- in the appendix of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.839" offset="1326686">Now, counsel for the Government never has answered the question that Mr. Marion posed in this Court and in the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.150" offset="1371930">He answered it this way that the -- under the Circuit Court's findings, there wouldn't be any liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.982" offset="1415293">I -- I'm going to come to that and I will call Your Honor's attention to it before the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.409" offset="1444968">Counsel for the Government does not comment on or seek to distinguish these cases but says that they involve facts where the defendant was at fault in the origin of the fire or was owner of the land when the fire occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.007" offset="1515395">In general, that is a correct statement but it is precisely the situation presented in our pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.787" offset="1550503">We contend that the Government was at fault in connection with the origin of the fire and we contend and plead that the Government was the owner of the property where the fire started.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.435" offset="1601076">In addition, we have cited on pages 22 and 23 of the opening brief the case called Great Northern versus Oakley which was a case where a fire started on lands of another.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.857" offset="1650813">It swept over the land that a receiver of a bankrupt company had a contract obligation to a big sludge.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.996" offset="1687385">The Washington Court held in that case and has never been overruled that even though the fire did not start through any fault of the defendant or on lands owned by him, he had a right to abate this last confounded, commensurate duty on him to abate.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.025" offset="1763453">Under the Washington Law cited in our brief and there's about 15 pages, the early part of our brief covering Washington Law in this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.503" offset="1801383">The Washington Law pertaining to a private landowner, the Washington Law pertaining to a municipal corporation, mind you, if the municipal corporation is dealing with its own lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.461" offset="1849240">And a law pertaining the Washington cases, and there's two of them, where the fire has been started and controlled and managed by a fire warden, state fire warden, and in all of those instances appears in our brief, they have held the landowner liable.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_ferguson" startTime="465.134" stopTime="741.213">
            <label>Mr. William H. Ferguson</label>
            <text syncTime="465.134" offset="1963865">In our opening brief and the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.560" offset="1973582">Under Washington Law, Rayonier or any private person would be liable under the facts pleaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.593" offset="2001795">It's also clear that the town of Forks where these petitioners reside because this fire went to the town, burned about half the town and the wind blew -- wind blew -- changed directions at that time and saved the other half of the town.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.215" offset="2060204">It's also clear that the town of Forks, that the town of Forks had owned the land where this fire had originally started six weeks before the catastrophe.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.540" offset="2101582">The town of Forks would have been liable under these laws of -- that are -- the decisions of the States of Washington on (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="508.017" offset="2135437">And that would be true even if the -- if the forest ranger here, Mr. Floe, had been a fire chief of that city and there we cite some fire chief cases with where a particularly one in the City of Toledo case where the -- that which happened in Oregon where the fire chief was in charge of the fire and the fire burned some third party buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.534" offset="2245465">So, we say to Your Honors that no matter how you compare this, whether you compare with a private individual, a private corporation or a municipal corporation, if you're going to use that test, the Government would be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.704" offset="2314219">Now the Government in the -- in an effort to avoid the effect of these decisions, takes the position that was a helpless Serbian owner under the Right of Way Act of 1875.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.429" offset="2361135">This assumption is unwarranted where the complaint alleges and the answer admits ownership, control and unrestricted access.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.898" offset="2394990">It is also unwarranted where this Court has previously held that a railroad can neither obtain a right of way across forest service lands that could not obtain a right -- a right of way across forest service lands under the 1875 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.357" offset="2472835">And I'm calling Your Honors attention to Chicago and Milwaukee versus United States, 244 U.S. at 351 which is in our opening brief on page 55.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.232" offset="2512332">It is also contrary to the actual fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.306" offset="2536573">The Government is asking this Court to adopt the Municipal Corporation Doctrine of Non-Liability for Fire Fighting as a judicially created exception of the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.308" offset="2588609">The Court should not adopt this theory for the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.354" offset="2604805">(1) Congress was aware of this liability whether they elected not to make a special exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.483" offset="2637302">On pages 32 and 33 of our opening brief, we have listed a number of private bills where the -- where prior to the Tort Claims Act, Congress had acted to relieve negligence of the Government employees (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="651.022" offset="2707414">In addition to that, Congress knew of the Bloedel Donovan versus United States case in the Court of Claims which this Court denied certiorari to which happened some -- just nine years to almost to the day before this fire in the same area, with the same ranger, under almost identical fire conditions and the Government was held liable in that case for the negligence of this same ranger.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.834" offset="2814725">As this Court pointed out also in the Indian Towing case, the Federal Tort Claims Act touched the ground from under that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.809" offset="2854640">It is not self-defeating by covertly embedding the casuistries of municipal liability for torts.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.036" offset="2895496">And thirdly, the Government has sought in the past and here seeks the status of a private person, in other words the Government here is not acting as a municipal corporation putting out a fire and not charging anybody for it in the complaint which is part of the record here to their answer in the cross-complaint, they are suing the Railroad for among other things that caused to putting this fire out.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.283" offset="3012524">They have also in the Chesapeake, Ohio case and the Spokane International Railroad case, both of which are cited in the brief sued others for the cause of putting out the fire.</text>

            <label>Mr. William H. Ferguson</label>
            <text syncTime="852.312" offset="3512613">Well, we are not -- we are not saying here that -- that they actually went out and kindled them.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.142" offset="3535914">But we are -- we are saying that these statutes and the case law that we have cited from Washington illustrate that this statutes are the standard of care applied by the courts in Washington and that even though they have held a person -- they have held a person for instance in Washington, under the same duty as that particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.549" offset="3633612">If the fire was kindled by someone else even including a trespasser, he had reasonable duty after notice to put it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.688" offset="3670079">That -- that is the point from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.589" offset="3685752">I might say in passing in connection with the matter of suing for fire fighting cost, the cities historically, public firemen, that is, City Fire Departments do not so for that cost of putting out fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.952" offset="3751163">But now even if this Court did decide to adopt the doctrine of public fireman, there is no excuse of emergency in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.009" offset="3787421">The Government had from August the 6th to September the 20th put this fire out to use due care, was in there -- was a very small smoldering fire at that time and that's one of the principal claims of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.332" offset="3844681">And they had several years under the pleadings to abate the debris that caused the origin of the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.825" offset="3870699">Secondly, that courts have never excused municipal corporations for failure in the housekeeping functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.828" offset="3898702">We cite cases in the brief for instance where there were defective floors in a fire station and things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.065" offset="3923675">This is housekeeping, this is prior to the origin of the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.503" offset="3941334">The New York cases are in conflict and in Steitz versus Beacon which is the one case cited in the Dalehite case on this matter, that Steitz versus Beacon case expressly recognized the exception which is where there's a statutory duty imposed on the person to put out the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.679" offset="4026075">And that is the situation that exists here.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.962" offset="4043212">In addition to that, the Government has the benefit of the duties imposed by these statutes in common laws in Washington in protection of the timber owned and timberlands owned in Washington by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.205" offset="4108204">There is more land as it appears in the brief in private hands, forest lands and private hands than there is Government hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.362" offset="4144776">And it's only fair that the Government should share its fair burden of these duties on the same basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.276" offset="4180511">Now in connection with Dalehite, both the lower courts clearly based their decision on Dalehite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.459" offset="4209246">Both of these decisions were before the Indian Towing case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.814" offset="4222621">I'd like to just take a moment to point out the factual distinctions between this case and Dalehite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.202" offset="4252191">In the Dalehite case, there was no government property involved, the cargo in the ship were French property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.667" offset="4278000">In the instant case, it's Government property that's caught on fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.023" offset="4291480">In the Dalehite case there was no duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.535" offset="4301511">This Court and the Circuit Court found there was no duty of any kind on the Coast Guard and no duty was ever pointed out on the Coast Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.982" offset="4327320">In this case, there's a statutory and a common law duty on the Government from that property ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.599" offset="4353755">In the Dalehite case, the Coast Guard never fought the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.170" offset="4372041">In this case, they did fight the fire from the inception, that is they took control but they didn't fight it sufficiently we say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.888" offset="4406941">In the Dalehite case, there was an emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.887" offset="4418957">Mr. Justice Jackson's dissenting opinion shows that the explosion occurred less than one hour after the fire started.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.760" offset="4450408">In this instance there were some 46 days, put it out, they could easily had been put out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.784" offset="4478516">In the Dalehite case, there was no notice shown that the Coast Guard even knew about the fire before the explosion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.854" offset="4510804">In this instance, they were notified immediately, took all the results notices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.534" offset="4529507">They certainly have plenty of notices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.409" offset="4537031">But the mostly important distinction of all, in the Dalehite case it was unprecedented that this fertilizer would explode.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.088" offset="4575692">Nobody knew although they had been handling it for seven or eight or nine years that it would explode.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.262" offset="4612472">It was unprecedented that it would explode but in a forest fire, the Supreme Court of Oregon said in speaking of -- in a statute very similar to one of the ones in our book, it is cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.168" offset="4672031">The Supreme Court of Oregon said that there is nothing more dangers to the life and to property than a forest fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.865" offset="4706826">I think that anyone who has lived in the West will realize that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.068" offset="4731695">Indian Towing rejects the municipal corporation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.377" offset="4752906">Fire fighting immunity is at the heart of Municipal corporation -- of the municipal corporation exemption and should likewise be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.713" offset="4790209">Now, the Circuit Court found that these statutes of Washington created liability without fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.184" offset="4832110">The District Court didn't make any such findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.739" offset="4846320">The Circuit Court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.715" offset="4854262">The petitioners here have alleged a series of 17 acts of negligence on the part of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.714" offset="4886235">The petitioners have not pleaded nor have they relied upon liability without faults.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.711" offset="4914239">This Court has many times said, it does not decide hypothetical questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.105" offset="4935764">We submit this is a hypothetical question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.036" offset="4951542">Those statutes in -- in our opening brief of Washington statutes have been construed on several occasions by the Supreme Court of Washington, the latest in 1955 in the Canyon Lumber case cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.342" offset="5012773">The Supreme Court of Washington en banc in 1955 and just about two months or three months before the Circuit Court decision, which didn't refer to it or any other authority for its findings, held that that act was constitutional and was not liability without fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.142" offset="5091976">We say that it is only a codification of the rules of the standard are fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.949" offset="5119143">I believe that is a fair holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.538" offset="5129488">If the Circuit Court decision is allowed to stand, it has defect upon the constitutionality of all of those fire statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.672" offset="5170030">The Government here has been confusing liability without fault with negligence per se, that in many cases under the Tort Claims Act in the 10 years since its passage whereby the Government has been held liable for breach of the statute or a city ordinance and on the bases of liability -- of negligence per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.513" offset="5269400">On proximate cause, the Circuit Court held that the last of the Government's negligence acts that is the failure to extinguish the fire between August the 11th and September the 20th was the sole proximate cost of the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.437" offset="5341080">The Government did not plead this as an intervening cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.381" offset="5360933">They accepted this as to wipe out the petitioner's claim against the Railroad which respondent says in its brief was this so -- was solely responsible for this damage and it also wipes out the Government's claim against the Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.167" offset="5420074">The fire started on August the 6th, it was still the same fire when the damage was caused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.772" offset="5446510">California Court in Osborne versus Woody cited in our brief says, “A fire is one fire no matter how far it goes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.786" offset="5478484">And the Minnesota Court said in Ferrell versus Minnesota, “A fire is the same fire even if it's joined by another fire.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.025" offset="5511502">Here there was a series of consecutive negligent acts by the same person, Mr. Floe, the forest ranger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.837" offset="5542745">They started with the housekeeping function which was permitting inflammable debris to accumulate on government land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.658" offset="5573987">At that time it was clear he was wearing his forester's hat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.472" offset="5593213">These negligent acts and with his failing to put out a fire in the 1600-acre estate and permitting the fire to escape, it was this same man wearing a fireman's hat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.194" offset="5644100">The effect of the Circuit Court decision is that Floe's negligence while wearing a fireman's hat was a superseding intervening cause and wiped out Floe's negligence in his forester's hat, or that Floe's own conduct was so unforeseeable that it necessarily intervened and this is holding this is a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.072" offset="5735633">This doctrine has never been adopted by any Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.255" offset="5752351">It is contrary to the Washington Law which governed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.829" offset="5770637">Under Washington Law approximate cause is usually a question for the jury or the fact-finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.323" offset="5796655">In Prince versus Chehalis cited in the brief, the Court said that with regard to fire cases and proximate cause said proximate cause is not the last act or the act nearest the injury, but one that actively aided in producing the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.922" offset="5867081">In the Theatre case cited in the brief, the Washington court held, another fire case, that a defective oil tank installed seven years before the accident was not superseded by the intervening negligence of the man filling that tank seven years later, that it was only a concurrent cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.218" offset="5952240">And in the Poling case the Washington court held that even a subsequent criminal act in this was not an intervening cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.891" offset="5986931">In that instance, they had come in the night, taken some plugs out of a fuel tank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.396" offset="6020995">This Court should use its power to correct these holdings or there will be a great injustice to these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.646" offset="6049938">There will be substantial loss to the Government on it's cross-complaint and it will confuse and conflict with the negligence law for the State of Washington.</text>

            <text syncTime="2026.366" offset="8208802">Then it says it shall be unlawful for any person to do any act which shall expose any of the forest or timber upon such land to the hazard of fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.342" offset="8260733">Well, we construe that is referring to an affirmative act of negligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2069.614" offset="8381837">Then Section 5807, and that's the one that maybe applicable, provides that the owner of any land on the State covered wholly or in part by inflammable debris created by logging or other forest operations, land clearing or right of way clearing shall abate this condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.386" offset="8484968">And it goes on to provide that the state may recover its cost, if the owner refuses or fails to do it after notice, and the State has to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.014" offset="8535437">Now the Courts of Washington as -- as we understand it, and I battle with deference to Mr. Ferguson because he is from there and I know he knows it greatly and more about it than I do but as we follow these cases, we can't find the Courts of Washington have ever held that this sections even create a civil remedy in damages for a violation.</text>
