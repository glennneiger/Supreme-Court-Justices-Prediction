            <label>Mr. Kevin T. Maroney</label>
            <text syncTime="13.375" offset="53499">Thank you, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.610" offset="66351">If it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.297" offset="69172">I would like to go back for just a few minutes to a question which arose yesterday concerning a -- a comparison between the Costello case and -- and this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.627" offset="134478">To recall once again in the Costello case a witness just simply flatly refuse to answer any questions, and the Court of Appeals held that situation was but one contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.733" offset="182857">In this situation, the witness on the first day of her cross-examination was interrogated concerning certain members of the Communist Party and she took the position that she would not testify as to her co-defendants who had rested and as to other members of the Communist Party because she did not want to become a government informer.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.455" offset="273763">Now, three days later and -- and at that time, of course, the Court incarcerated the witness, the petitioner here, until such time that she would agree to answer the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.120" offset="324441">Now, three days later while still on cross-examination, the witness, when she was interrogated concerning certain other members of the Communist Party, reiterated her previous position and added that, "I am willing to give names of people whom I know I cannot hurt, but where it is a question of damaging their interest, of harming their ability to make a livelihood, of hurting their families, no."</text>
            <text syncTime="108.275" offset="433006">She then refused after making that statement to answer the 11 questions which are the specifications of the contempt involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.201" offset="480758">Now, what she did then on the second occasion was to say to the Court that I have previously refused to answer four questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.381" offset="517433">Now, I have asked additional questions concerning members of the Communist Party and I will have to determine on a question by question basis, which questions I will answer, which questions I will refuse to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.667" offset="574589">Now, in the Costello case, we submit, the witness having stated I won't answer anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.958" offset="603742">The -- the nature of the contempt, the extent of the defiance was apparent, it was complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.392" offset="637492">And a sentencing judge would have the -- the full benefit of the seriousness of the contempt of the particular witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.014" offset="676049">In this case, on the first day, when the witness refused to answer four specific questions while asserting at the same time that she would still continue to answer other questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.394" offset="721502">The District Court did not know the extent of the witness' defiance of his lawful orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.185" offset="756715">It became much more apparent four -- three days later when she made it more crystal clear that she herself would have to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.980" offset="795899">She would not accept the judge's decision as to whether a particular question would be answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.687" offset="818678">She herself would decide on the basis of her own subjective test, what questions would be answered and what questions would not be answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.156" offset="856607">So I submit that if a Court having been defied on four occasions on one day and having incarcerated the witness until such time as she would purge was thereby divested of any authority three days later to further -- to take further steps in connection with this contempt, this repeated defiant attitude of the witness that the -- the trial courts would find themselves in interminable position, a position which would cause a criminal trial to degenerate into a witness conducting or master -- mastering the conduct of the trial rather than the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="345.089" offset="1380310">She didn't do that here because she specifically stated here, “I am going to decide on a question by question basis.”</text>
            <text syncTime="353.200" offset="1412702">The prosecutor couldn't know when he asked a question if she was going to answer the question or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1382.549" offset="5530122">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.042" offset="5540153">Now, that -- I think only have two or three minutes left and I would just like to discuss the petitioner's contention of the Court's purpose here in giving here the one year sentence was to coerce rather than to punish, rather than to vindicate the authority of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.658" offset="5614550">And in -- in an attempt to bolster their argument, they have isolated colloquy between Court and counsel in not only this proceeding but in the other contempt proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.746" offset="5658958">However, the order of judgement in the certificate here of criminal contempt is specifically clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.051" offset="5692186">It's precise that the Court was proceeding in this case under Rule 42 (a), the criminal contempt statute, that he found her guilty of criminal contempt and that the imposition of the one year sentence was for her criminal contempt and not to coerce her answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.477" offset="5769822">And the colloquy that is cited by the petitioners, insofar as it relates to this case, only reflects the -- the grace of the Court in offering to accept a layer answering of the questions as a bowing by the petitioner to the authority of the Court and to accept that as vindication of the Court's authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.553" offset="5882149">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leo Branton, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1481.966" offset="5927811">I would like to reply very briefly to a few of the matters raised by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.539" offset="5970129">The position of the respondent that because Mrs. Yates, after first stating a position, after first stating that she would refuse to answer questions which would identify people as members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.116" offset="6044421">As I understand his position, it is that because she later relaxed her position and said, "Well, I want to be of as much benefit to this Court as I can and answer questions as much I can and still maintain my position of conscience, and so there are some questions that I will answer."</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.191" offset="6124669">Because of that she could committed a different contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.868" offset="6139402">Now, this seems to me to be that our fairest position that anyone could possibly take because for example if the witness had answered all the questions that had been asked her on direct examination and at the time of cross-examination she had said, "I absolutely refuse to answer any questions," I don't think there is argument on the part of respondent but that that would have only been one contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.807" offset="6243161">But here is our witness who does not pick and choose to suit herself as the respondent would have this Court believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.737" offset="6270851">And she did not answer questions which she thought would help herself and refuse to answer the questions which she thought might hurt herself as he would have you believe, she only refused to answer questions which came with that a narrow refinement which she herself have said yes, but she said it because she was complying with her position of conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.367" offset="6349427">She answered all of the questions about herself, even as to the questions about these particular people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.878" offset="6371474">She admitted that she knew these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.065" offset="6380251">She had -- she told about how long she had known these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.560" offset="6394149">And the only time she refused to answer any questions at all is when the answer are called for in an identification of these people as members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.044" offset="6432078">Now, I think that when a witness his willing to give testimony that we should certainly be much more lenient with that witness than we should be with a witness who absolutely refuses to give any testimony whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.242" offset="6480875">Now, the respondent would also make much out of the fact that the witness answered questions about some of the -- of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.517" offset="6510028">Now, what was her position?</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.863" offset="6515357">Her position was, "I will not answer questions about any person who -- that will identify these people as members of the Communist Party if it will hurt these people."</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.895" offset="6559556">Now, certainly she knows at her own mind and anybody knows that answering a question about William Z. Foster, the head of the Communist Party, a man who was not tried because of a heart condition and is probable that he will never be -- be tried for this -- for which he was charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.025" offset="6620056">And the man who is publicly and baldly a Communist that she could not hurt that person by testifying that that person is a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.998" offset="6651925">It is likewise within the knowledge of everyone that she could not hurt this Mike Quinn by identifying Mike Quinn as a member of the Communist Party, Mike Quinn was dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.435" offset="6689646">So naturally in order to show her good faith she said, "I will only answer about people whom I can hurt."</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.475" offset="6709812">She would have been in bad faith that she had refused to answer the question about Mike Quinn because how could she possibly hurt Mike Quinn who was dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.039" offset="6740114">So this shows the good faith of this witness and this shows that this witness was not trying to protect herself but was only trying to maintain her consistent claim of conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.614" offset="6778358">Now, as to one other matter, when the Court sentenced her in civil contempt, if in fact this was a -- a one contempt, the Court did punish her twice for the same contempt because the Court gave her three years for this contempt because when the trial was over she was sentenced to three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.238" offset="6912940">So she has been punished both civilly and criminally for this one contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.861" offset="6931435">And that is the judgment which the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and that is the judgment which the respondent took no appeal from, so as far as that judgment is concerned, it is final.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.480" offset="6969887">So in this particular case, the witness has been punished once in civil contempt for which she has spent 70 days, and she has been punished in criminal contempt for which she -- she was given three years and that has been reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.011" offset="7015967">And now, he can come back say that she can be given one year for a contempt which was essentially only one contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.603" offset="7046374">And finally, I want to say this in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.152" offset="7060584">It is not important that the prosecutor does not know in advance which questions will fall within this refinement of hers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.124" offset="7104470">It is only important that when a question is asked that falls within this confinement which she set for herself, that it goes back to the original contempt which was total when she set this category for herself and it is only one contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.648" offset="7162567">And the reason for it is, is that in a contempt it requires as in most other criminal offenses an intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.292" offset="7193078">And if the witnesses says, "I am not going to answer any question concerning this particular category," when she is asked a question 50 days later or 100 days later or about 100 different people as long is that question falls within this confinement which she has set for herself, it is still a part of her original intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.443" offset="7269669">No second intent has come about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.660" offset="7278550">She still refuses to answer the question because of the original intent which she had, not to answer a question which is going to hurt anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.852" offset="7311360">I submit, Your Honors, that this petitioner who has spent more than 70 days in jail as a result of a mere claim of conscience and not because of any obstruction of the Court, because the judicial process was not obstructed as a result of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.155" offset="7368620">When she has done that that is sufficient under the law, not only to coerce the answers which the Court was really trying to do at all times but also to vindicate the authority of the Court.</text>
