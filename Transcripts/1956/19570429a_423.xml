            <text syncTime="79.444" offset="421177">A labor organization is defined as any organization of any kind in which employees participate for the purpose of dealing with one or more employers concerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of employment or conditions of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.720" offset="506232">Then, Section 1, goes on to define public employee briefly as any person who is compensated in whole or in part by the State or by any state agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.650" offset="553984">Now, Section 2, which is the key Section of this statute, provides very simply that any public employee who becomes or remains a member of a labor union or labor organization or who participates in that union automatically forfeits all employment rights, benefits, and privileges which he has as a public employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.588" offset="657742">Section 3, to which I'll refer a little later, specifically excludes from the operation of the Act, all teachers, all employees of the State Docks Board, those are people who work for the railroad which is owned and operated by the State, and that further excludes all city and county employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.049" offset="739558">Now, the issues in this case, as we have stated them, are whether consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment, a State can constitutionally bar a state employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.886" offset="782921">In this case, a man who is a retail liquor sales man in a state-owned and operated liquor store, from his job and any other public employment solely because he belongs to a labor union, whether the State can compel that employee in order to retain his employment to resign his membership in that organization because one of it's ultimate purposes is the attainment of collective bargaining relationships with Government, with the people with whom it deals when and only when the State permits such collective bargaining to be carried on.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.476" offset="953240">Whether the Fourteenth Amendment permits the exercise and protects the exercise by that state employee of his rights of voluntary association, his rights of free speech, when those rights are exercised through his membership in a labor union.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.485" offset="1025337">And finally, if and only if all these questions are determined against us, whether the State can limit that prohibition so that it excludes that prohibition from city employees, county employees, employees who are already organized in the labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.540" offset="1109556">Now, the defendants don't join issue with us on these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.752" offset="1126379">They contend that the very nature of this union is such that collective bargaining is an inherent purpose which it says, cannot be abandoned voluntarily except through certain technical procedures which it says have not been followed that a person who belongs to this union can't give the State of Alabama his undivided allegiance and that the State can prohibit membership in point of union in order to ensure that undivided allegiance.</text>

            <text syncTime="388.783" offset="1658546">Now, however, there has been a specific adjudication by the Supreme Court of Alabama, not as a matter -- not only as a matter of language, but a specific holding on the identical record which is before this Court which was incorporated by reference before the United States District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1035.369" offset="4244877">Before the -- before the Solomon Act was passed, the plaintiff union had asked the authorities of Alabama for collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.362" offset="4296808">And specifically, the administrators of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board which I'll call the ABC Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.514" offset="4333380">Now, that right was denied to them and when that denial was made, they, thereafter, exceeded to that denial, and they, thereafter, did not assert either a right to bargain collectively nor a right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.752" offset="4394402">And I might say that that – their act ceding to do that was in accordance with the objects of this union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.016" offset="4419480">The objects of this union are stated and the one relevant here to increase the wages and to improve the conditions of employment of our members by legislation, negotiation or other legitimate means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.074" offset="4479666">In other words, at that point, the union became as described by the only witness on this subject basically a discussion group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.477" offset="4525328">I'll get to the other activities which have engaged in just a moment, but it proceeded to discuss with its members privately and at meetings, such things as federal social security legislation, public housing, economic and political issues, civil rights, political candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.671" offset="4594082">Now, defendants have stressed two items of activity which they claim are inconsistent with this characterization, a plaintiff union as a discussion group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.156" offset="4635982">The first item of activity is -- and these are conceded, there is no question about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.936" offset="4655104">These are part of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.786" offset="4662523">Plaintiff union and its members discussed the pros and cons of prospective legislation to provide for collective bargaining for state employees, and they thought about sponsoring that legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.059" offset="4711633">Similarly, when the Solomon Act was proposed in the state legislature, plaintiff union and its members contacted their legislators to try to defeat that Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.384" offset="4752906">Now, the other item of activity that defendants urge is that prior to passage of the Solomon Act, a representative of plaintiff union as part of its practice of assisting its members in connection with their individual employment problems appeared before the Alabama Personnel Board with some of those members to help settle the grievances which had arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.475" offset="4845275">Now, promptly after passage of the Solomon Act, the defendant's predecessors sent copies to the Bill to all the liquor stores and stated that all the employees had to sign those to confirm the fact they had read the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.187" offset="4900133">Plaintiff (Inaudible) and all the other ABC Board employees did in fact initial the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.114" offset="4927822">Immediately after that, the -- as the witness -- only witness on this subject stated, “The membership simply evaporated from 250 to 300 members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.810" offset="4970663">The union went down to a point where plaintiff (Inaudible) and perhaps one other member remained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.683" offset="4998144">Plaintiff (Inaudible) stated that he remained a member because he believed that he had a right to be a member of this organization in the same manner that he had a right to belong to his church.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.536" offset="5041507">Now then, we filed suit in the District Court to which Mr. Justice Frankfurter has referred asking injunctive relief against the enforcement of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.262" offset="5084453">The Court at that time withheld the exercise of jurisdiction, it abstained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.404" offset="5105037">That abstention came before this Court and was affirmed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.982" offset="5127293">At that time, no construction of the statute had been obtained from the Alabama Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.103" offset="5151744">At that point, suit was filed in the -- in the Circuit Court of Montgomery County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.824" offset="5174627">The judgment in the Circuit Court was that the Act did apply to plaintiff union, its members and activities as I have described those activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.503" offset="5217364">There are no other elements which are in the record describing plaintiff's activities, plaintiff union's activities as they have been held to be subject to the Solomon Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1598.849" offset="6498722">Now, I submit to the Court that the construction and by construction, I would probably better use the "application" that the application that has been made of the statute by the Alabama Supreme Court, an application which applies to this union and to its members as those activities are described in the complaint and which I have now described is an unconstitutional application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.166" offset="6624005">And I don't believe that it requires really a great deal of constitutional citation for that purpose because before and now, the cases to which we have referred in our brief, the Wieman case, the Slochower case, Adler, Garner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.051" offset="6687535">All those cases have involved a conflict between a state interest and an interest of the government employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.516" offset="6729435">I submit, if it pleases the Court, that there is no legitimate state interest which is here involved being protected as a price for taking away the constitutional rights of these individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.462" offset="6801220">There is no reasonable relationship between the fact which is the only fact required for this disqualification for employment that is the fact of union membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.122" offset="6859839">There is no reasonable relationship between the fact of union membership and unsuitability for public employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.449" offset="6893171">And yet, the Solomon Act specifically states and the Court, I submit, has read it in fact literally that any public employee who is a member of this labor organization loses his rights of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.210" offset="6968195">And labor organization is defined not as an organization in which there is insistence on collective bargaining with the State of Alabama because that's not in this case nor is that an organization which insist on the right to strike because that's not in this case either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.758" offset="7042382">It is only an organization in which employees participate for the purpose of dealing with one or more employers concerning these elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.646" offset="7081984">Now, there is no question, but that this organization, the Government and Civic Employees Organizing Committee does deal with one or more employers regarding these things because it is an organization that does not restrict its activities to the ABC Board and where those activities of negotiation and bargaining are permissible under state law, it does engage in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.943" offset="7191176">But where those activities are not permissible as they were advised by the defendant's predecessors in this case, there was no insistence on that so that what we have is the bare activities which are described in this complaint, discussion, the sponsoring of legislation, the opposition to other legislation and the processing of individual grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.519" offset="7297442">Only those activities are involved in this case and those activities have been specifically held to subject this union and the employees who are members of this union to the penalties under the Solomon Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.753" offset="7358360">I submit that the due process question in this case virtually answers itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.240" offset="7388348">This cannot satisfy the terms of this Court's statements in the Slochower case, the Wieman case, which require that before there can be restrictions on government employment, those restrictions must be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.180" offset="7456057">They must not be arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.033" offset="7463476">They must bear a relationship to this valid state purposes sought to be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.419" offset="7497017">Apparently, the defendants would equate the idea that a government -- that a person does not have a right, the constitutional right to be a government employee with the conclusion that a government employee does not have constitutional rights, but of course that is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.224" offset="7584266">I think that -- perhaps the best characterization of the Alabama position with respect to the activities of this organization is found that they're -- at pages 16 and 17 of the appellees' brief in which they refer to the witnesses -- witness battle, the union organizers' testimony as to sponsoring legislation and say, “This testimony not only tends to show that the union is not a mere discussion group as claimed, but that the union and the state employee members thereof have engaged in sponsoring collective bargaining legislation for state employees and -- and have attempted to defeat legislation which prohibits collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.796" offset="7778513">As individuals, the constitutional right is there, but as state employees, it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.006" offset="7803382">Such action is contrary to the declared public policy of the State of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.926" offset="7831071">I submit, Your Honors, that the third public policy of the State of Alabama cannot prevail over this Court's decisions with respect to the scope of due process protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.176" offset="7876106">Now, what do defendants fallback on?</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.889" offset="7886973">They turned to cases and various State Board cases in which it has been held that policemen and firemen may be prohibited from engaging in union activity and indeed from unionization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.429" offset="7953115">But each one of those cases was rested specifically on the proposition that there are special problems, special semi-military problems which relates to policemen and firemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.335" offset="8016750">They -- each one of them has rested on the proposition that the police and fire departments are in a class apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.421" offset="8045066">Both are at times charged with the preservation of the public order and for men, of all reasons, they owe to the public their undivided allegiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.943" offset="8079130">The power in the state of complete control is imperatively necessary if discipline is to be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.555" offset="8109641">Now, even if those decisions are available, and that's a problem that will come before this Court in another case which is now pending on its document.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.167" offset="8144018">That statute, those cases and the statutes and ordinances which relate there would not control this case because there you have the narrowly drawn statutes dealing with perhaps a permissible problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.335" offset="8204727">But the same considerations of this public order, safety, unqualified discipline which apply to the policemen and firemen do not apply to permit the prohibition of union organization and participation among all state employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.949" offset="8275153">Plaintiff (Inaudible) is certainly not in a class apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.301" offset="8292603">He is a liquor store clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.387" offset="8300962">Indeed, the Solomon Act actually accepts from its application, these policemen and firemen as city and county employees indeed in anomalous result if the purpose of this Act, the purpose of a legislation is to ensure the undivided allegiance, the necessary maintenance of complete discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.436" offset="8397093">There is no question that public employment and private employment are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.157" offset="8412035">Defendants urged that at length and we certainly agree, but what defendants fail to recognize, or perhaps refused to recognize, is that the basic difference between those two types of employment is what brings us into court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.058" offset="8467623">That is that the public action, the public employer when he acts engages in state action which is subject to the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment and the state action which is represented by the Solomon Act violates the Due Process Clause of that Amendment.</text>
