            <label>Mr. Morton Hollander</label>
            <text syncTime="18.140" offset="175940">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.911" offset="190986">This case, Number 18 is here on certiorari to the United States Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.760" offset="222438">Petitioner is the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.793" offset="234559">Respondents are three rail carriers, the Western Pacific, Bangor and Aroostook and Seaboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.146" offset="267995">These three carriers instituted this litigation by filing suits against the United States in the Court of Claims contending that they had been underpaid for certain shipments transported by the Government over the lines of these carriers during World War II and the Korean conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.130" offset="367888">The next case which will be called on the calendar, Number 19, United States against Chesapeake and Ohio emerges out of a somewhat similar factual background in the sense that that case too represents a carrier claim for underpayment against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.820" offset="438627">That case came out of the District Court and is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.432" offset="469138">Both of these cases present this basic question as to the effect to be given Section 16 (3), the Section of the Interstate Commerce Act which prescribes a two-year period of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.618" offset="541863">We believe that the Court of Claims, Number 18 and that the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Number 19, applied this statute in a fashion which was unjust and discriminatory as far as the United States, as a shipper is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.265" offset="608423">Now, let me give you the factual background in Number 18, the Western Pacific case.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.147" offset="631933">In 1944, in 1948 and in 1950, the Government shipped over the lines of these three carriers about 200 shipments of steel bomb body cases filled with napalm gel.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.113" offset="711868">I'd like to explain exactly what these shipments consisted of because the -- the makeup and the ingredients of these particular shipments account -- accounted for the original filing of these suits against the United States in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.724" offset="782294">The shipment says, I have said consisted of steel bomb body cases filled with napalm gel.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.030" offset="803506">Napalm gel is ordinary liquid gasoline that has been solidified or thickened by the addition of a soap powder known in the trade as napalm.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.355" offset="852825">The addition of the soap powder to the gasoline does not work any chemical change in the net product; the thickened gasoline, it simply changes its physical state by converting it from a liquid to a solid, thickened and adhesive form.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.973" offset="919280">The addition of this napalm to the gasoline in no way makes the gasoline any more hazardous certainly than it was before.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.574" offset="945716">In fact, the addition of the napalm that thickened it to the gasoline by solidifying the liquid gasoline makes these shipments relatively far safer from a transportation as they point their view because there is eliminated any possibility of leakage.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.889" offset="1014888">There is eliminated any possibility of spillage and of course there isn't anywhere as near as much vaporization from the thickened, solidified gel as there is from the liquid gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.868" offset="1066820">Our basic position with respect to the appropriate classification rate at which these shipments are eligible to travel is that the shipments should not -- the shipments were eligible for transportation at a rate denominated in the freight tariffs as a fifth-class rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.967" offset="1179251">We base our position on the fact that steel bomb body cases themselves are regularly carried at the fifth-class rate, gasoline has always been carried at the fifth-class rate and the napalm itself is aluminum soap powder which is used as the thickener has always been carried at the fifth-class rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.326" offset="1276635">Since all of these items were eligible for carriage at the fifth-class rate, our position has been that when the gel is added or poured into the steel bomb body cases, the transportation rate should be no higher than fifth-class.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.513" offset="1357406">Especially, since the addition of the thickener to the gasoline as I have pointed out actually makes the shipment far safer from the transportation point of view.</text>

            <text syncTime="326.455" offset="1409233">No -- no, there is -- it's -- it's not in dispute in this case that the only items shipped in these cases, the only ingredients shipped in these cases were the empty steel shell and into which was poured this thickened gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.913" offset="1470986">There were no fuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.508" offset="1477360">There were no bursters.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.956" offset="1491153">A completed incendiary bomb in order for it to function effectively on the field must have the fuse and must in addition have a burster which includes both an incendiary agent as well as an explosive, TNT.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.527" offset="1553429">Now, it's conceded in this case that the burster charge which includes both the explosive and the incendiary agent, the white phosphorous were not included within these shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.056" offset="1595643">All we have in these shipments is this thickened gasoline plus the steel bomb body cases and we say that since a gasoline itself should be -- is always transported at fifth, the napalm concededly is transported at fifth and the steel bomb body case is transported at fifth-class rate, that's the rate that we were entitled to and we paid the carriers on that basis either originally or by deductions from later bills submitted by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.964" offset="1691251">The carriers on the other hand consistently have maintained that what were shipped in these cases should have been shipped at the relatively higher first class rate, a rate approximately three times in dollars and cents higher than the fifth-class rate which the Government paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.064" offset="1759587">Their position -- their position is that the -- the closest -- the closest way you can describe these articles is by calling them incendiary bombs because -- and it is not disputed that that was the ultimate use to which they were going to be put in the field of battle after however the incendiary agent; the white phosphorus was added after the explosive element, the TNT was added and after the fuse was added but none of these latter three component parts necessary to the effective functioning of these commodity as an incendiary bomb were included in any of these shipments.</text>

            <text syncTime="737.152" offset="3052022">The -- I -- I think the carrier -- it could have moved in the Court of Claims for a suspension of the judicial proceedings in order to allow the Court of Claims to refer the question of -- of possible unreasonableness of the application of the low fifth-class rates to these shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.466" offset="3145226">However, that was never suggested in this case and there has never been any contention in this case by the carriers that it would be unreasonable to apply the lower fifth-class rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.075" offset="3191724">Their -- their argument is, I think Judge Madden quite accurately points out in his dissent is simply this that the nearest way you can describe these shipments is to call them incendiary bombs ergo the high rate applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.698" offset="3246164">Judge Madden pointed out in his dissenting opinion that it is really was the -- the extreme literal reading of any tariff rate which took into account, not at all, the purpose for which these high rates were originally designed namely to actually work and give the carrier benefit of an insurance premium against the tremendous risk of potential liability entailed in the carriage of articles which are truly hazardous, truly explosive and truly incendiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.930" offset="3371133">And he points out in his opinion that by applying the fifth -- the first class rates as the Court of Claims did in this case to these shipments, the carriers are -- are getting a pure win for they're being paid for expenses they do not incur, expenses ordinarily required to be incurred by carriers when they are carrying goods which are subject to the Interstate Commerce Commission's regulations on explosives and other dangerous articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.310" offset="3460577">When they are carrying goods, which have to be packed, which have to be stored, which have to be braced, which have to be blocked in a certain way, articles from which only the finest type of -- of rolling equipment can be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.350" offset="3504776">All of those expenses were not and are not incurred by the carriers in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.789" offset="3522539">Judge Madden's dissent very firmly points out that the only justification for these high first class rates are these extraordinary expenses which are not entailed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.989" offset="3555349">For that reason, Judge Madden concluded in his dissenting opinion that the carriers are really getting something for nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="889.428" offset="3661093">Well, that of course, Your Honor, that our basic position -- our basic position in the Court of Claims as I say was first, that as a matter of tariff construction, the Court of Claims could find that the lower fifth-class rates applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.946" offset="3699127">We also argued that if they were of the view that these high first class rates applied then they should have suspended proceedings and referred the case to the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.211" offset="3736221">Now, what the Court of Claims did was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.370" offset="3744893">They said, “No we disagree with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.553" offset="3753566">The high first class rates applied and we will not refer this case to the Interstate Commerce Commission.”</text>
            <text syncTime="919.025" offset="3779480">We recognize that ordinarily when a question of reasonableness is posed during litigation of this order, it's all together appropriate, it's mandatory for the Court to stay its hand, hold the judicial proceedings in advance and refer the reasonableness question to the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.802" offset="3834546">Here the Court of Claims did not see fit to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.182" offset="3844054">Instead they said, “While we recognize that ordinarily you, the Government, the shipper in this case would have a right to have your claim of unreasonableness determined by the Interstate Commerce Commission.”</text>
            <text syncTime="945.333" offset="3884701">Here, they told us, “You came in too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.940" offset="3895150">You came in too late.”</text>
            <text syncTime="949.312" offset="3900583">Two-year period of Section 16 (3) of the Interstate Commerce Act which is set forth in page 3 of our brief, bars any reference to the Interstate Commerce Commission even though this is ordinarily a matter appropriate for Commission determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.923" offset="3963068">And that ruling -- that ruling actually forms the -- forms the framework for the principal question on appeal here.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.015" offset="3995460">We believe that the Court of Claims -- the Court of Claims committed not only reversible but egregious error in this rule -- in ruling that we were barred from going to the I.C.C. because of the passage of that two-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.040" offset="4051571">We believe first that the unfairness of the result reached by the I.C.C. actually condemns the ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.934" offset="4087097">We also believe that there's absolutely nothing in Section 16 (3), not a -- not a word, not a syllable in Section 16 (3) which compels the unfair result arrived at by the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.063" offset="4127640">Finally, we believe that the ruling of the Court of Claims completely ignored the special position occupied by the United States in its traditional sovereign immunity from statute of limitations of all sorts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.440" offset="4173093">And I would like at the present time to address my argument to that branch of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.812" offset="4194617">First of all, the unfairness of the result, the Court of Claims has consistently ruled since 1926 that despite the language in Section 16 (3) (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act, the section which imposes a two-year limitation on carriers when they want to file suit against shippers for underpayments which was what was involved in this case, the carrier suit against the shipper for an underpayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.817" offset="4298689">Section 16 (3) (a) says, the carrier has two years to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.937" offset="4315094">What has the Court of Claims done with that section?</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.754" offset="4326379">It's ignored it and ripped it off the books completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.694" offset="4338186">It says that this section which by its terms applies to all actions that law by carriers has no application to suits by carriers against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.634" offset="4373922">Against the United States, the carrier has a much longer period, three times as long, six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.057" offset="4395551">Now, when the United States comes into Court and has to defend as it did in this case, suits filed almost six years, suits filed by the carriers almost six years after the causes of actions accrued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.779" offset="4442467">In Western Pacific for example, the shipments took place in 1948 and 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.322" offset="4464619">Payment was promptly made at that time at the lower fifth-class rate contended by the Government to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.620" offset="4489801">The carriers held back, not for two years, not for four years but for almost six years and in 1954, they filed these suits against the United States far later than the two-year period which ordinarily would have barred their actions against us in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.018" offset="4559496">The Court of Claims says, “Well, that doesn't make any difference to the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.151" offset="4571930">You have a much longer period.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.558" offset="4577573">But when we raised the question of reasonableness, I think, this is of crucial significance because everybody concedes, both parties concede, the Court of Claims recognized that if we were able to establish our defense of unreasonableness of the application of the high first class rates to these shipments, there is no question -- there is no question a judgment would ultimately have had to go for the United States in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.767" offset="4666389">Everybody concedes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.970" offset="4671300">Everybody concedes furthermore that the question of reasonableness is one exclusively for I.C.C. determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.233" offset="4696273">We're on common ground there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.686" offset="4702124">We're also on common ground that it is the duty of the Court that -- and this is -- this is where I'm common ground with respondents and with the Court of Claims, it's the duty of the Court to refer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.681" offset="4738069">We have a right to have the question of reasonableness referred to the Commission whenever the question is raised during pendency of a judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.860" offset="4770774">Notwithstanding the fact that all those principles are well-established, there's no dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.931" offset="4787075">The Court of Claims says to the Government, “No.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.897" offset="4798986">You're too late for a referral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.273" offset="4808495">Two-year period prescribed by Section 16 (3) (b) of the Interstate Commerce Act which applies to complaints by shippers against carriers, that two-year period has gone by.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.098" offset="4855724">You're out of luck.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.924" offset="4863039">And -- and the Court of Claims -- the -- the Court of Claims' reasoning -- the Court of Claims' reasoning is -- is actually -- actually comes down to nothing more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.912" offset="4898983">The opinion makes very plain that the only reason the Court of Claims refused to let us go to the Commission for a determination of the reasonableness question was because this same two-year period which they have refused to invoked against the carriers to bar their suits against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.796" offset="4954572">They say that, “That two-year period nevertheless prevents you from establishing the defensive unreasonableness before the I.C.C.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.342" offset="4980694">The only body authorized to pass on such a question of unreasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.122" offset="4995845">Now, we believe that as I said before that the very result, the very unfairness of this result condemns it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.862" offset="5018833">Now perhaps, if there was something in the language of Section 16 (3) which compelled, which -- which actually compel that -- that conclusion it might as the respondents say; “Be a matter for -- for a legislative -- for a legislative consideration for potential legislative remedy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.999" offset="5087378">Perhaps, if the language were really as strong as that maybe the Court's hands are tight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.834" offset="5106709">But if -- if Your Honors would read Section 16 (3) (b), the section relied on by the Court of Claims, you will see that first of all it doesn't refer at all to anything but independent reparation proceedings filed by a shipper against the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.313" offset="5168671">Not a syllable, as I pointed out before, covers the situation we have here where on the assumption of the Court of Claims itself, the action was timely filed and we were trying to get a referral on the basis and as an incident of this timely filed judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.930" offset="5247143">Nothing in Section 16 (3) (b), Your Honors, in anyway impinges upon the power of a court as an incident of a judicial proceeding, timely filed before it and that of course was the view of the Court of Claims, carrier's actions were timely filed before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.668" offset="5310046">Nothing in Section 16 (3) (b) in anyway impinges on the right of the Court to make a referral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.735" offset="5334288">Actually, if the Court is entertaining the affirmative claim by the carrier against the shipper, it -- it would seem to us to follow it as a necessary corollary that that the Court must give us an opportunity to establish our defenses, not this --</text>

            <text syncTime="1341.214" offset="5468244">They're private shippers in the same box.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.376" offset="5480887">Now, even if that were so, I don't think that the fact that the private shippers as at disadvantage requires the -- the perpetuation of the injustice by extension to the United States as a shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.936" offset="5527071">But the fact is that that is not so because as against the private shipper, the carrier would have to file within two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.754" offset="5558418">If the carrier filed against the private shipper within two years even respondents concede that their action would be thrown out as being barred by Section 16 (3) (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.613" offset="5593840">So, the carrier has the filing as to private shipper in two years that affords the opportunity to the private shipper to go before the Commission within that same period of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1976.136" offset="8007868">In this case as in the (Inaudible) case argued last week, the Government comes before this Court asserting that it is not like other shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.837" offset="8054680">That it is not bound by the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, that it is not bound by the rules of this Court which forbids the smuggling of additional questions into the case after certiorari is granted, that it can shift its position on the classification issue and that it can welsh on the stipulation solemnly entered into at the trial of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.674" offset="8154049">I shall deal first with the question of procedure, the administrative law question arising out of the request for a reference and then with the question of classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.794" offset="8198562">Now, there is one difference between the Government's position in the (Inaudible) and here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.031" offset="8219460">In the North appears it only sought one advantage over other shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.522" offset="8237432">Here it has several advantages over ordinary shippers now and at once another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.218" offset="8264286">Where a shipper, the ordinary shipper brings suit in Court for overcharges seeking to recover overcharges it's bound by limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.781" offset="8302529">But this Court has held and the lower courts following it have held that where the Government sues for overcharges it is not barred by limitations because it is the sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.175" offset="8344116">And similarly, it has been held in the Court of Claims that where the Government counterclaims are on alleged overcharges that accrued before the period of limitations, it isn't bound by limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.230" offset="8404302">And the Government has an additional advantage and that is the Comptroller General's unilateral power of settle where as in the Bangor and Aroostook and Seaboard cases in this Number 18, the Government has paid the carriers at the billed rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.755" offset="8478386">The Comptroller General has the power to say, “That was a wrong payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.037" offset="8499493">I will deduct from your subsequent bills the additional amount that I think you were overpaid.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.912" offset="8523003">And that was done here and that is a power that can be exercised without any limitation as to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.745" offset="8554350">Now, here as in so many other cases when that arbitrary exercise of the Comptroller General's power has been judicially condemned now, the Government wants to go to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.571" offset="8605654">Before then it was perfectly -- it is satisfied to invoke the administrative meet acts of the General Accounting Office.</text>

            <text syncTime="2402.249" offset="9712410">What Mr. Hollander says there's nothing in the statute on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.849" offset="9726725">But there's a great deal in the decisions of this Court and the rulings of the Commission and they are uniformly to the effect that the expiration of the statutory period is a limitation on the power of the Commission that in the language of Mr. Justice Brandeis's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.088" offset="9795688">In other words this is the limitation going not to the standing of the litigant but a limitation going to the power of the tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.899" offset="9834977">And therefore, the Interstate Commerce Commission has held for years that when the United States seeks repatriation on the basis of an alleged unreasonableness of the rate, if they come in more than two years, later they can't succeed and they can't maintain the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.123" offset="9899865">And the same rule has been applied to the ordinary shipper in this Court in the Morrisdale case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.859" offset="9922853">That was a case back in the 230th U.S. when the concept of the exclusive Commission jurisdiction over questions of reasonableness was first being formulated and the Morrisdale case came up at about the same time as the Mitchell case to which is of course a leading case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.414" offset="9993070">And Morrisdale's lawyers seeing their cause of action going glimmering said, “Well, all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.502" offset="10017416">If we can't have the District Court, the Circuit Court as it then was determine the question of reasonableness at least let us suspend so that we can go back to the Commission.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.597" offset="10061720">And this Court said, “Sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.590" offset="10073736">Your time for going to the Commission has expired.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.963" offset="10087215">Now, it is said by the Government here, while the Government is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.366" offset="10100799">This is a judicial reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.493" offset="10109367">Well, now supposed that the Court of Claims had exceeded to my Brother's request had suspended the proceedings said “Okay.</text>

            <text syncTime="2510.338" offset="10144684">Well, what would the Commission have done when the Government had come in there for a determination?</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.276" offset="10164433">It would have thrown the Government out on its sovereign here because under a long line of cases the Government stood in no different position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.211" offset="10196198">“Well,” says the Government, but here the -- the -- this is different, the shippers in these other cases were seeking affirmative relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.624" offset="10233919">We are not seeking a affirmative relief, we are defending, Wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.125" offset="10259832">Here, the Government is seeking affirmative relief in three different aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.017" offset="10283447">In the first place, as I have indicated if there was such a suspension and they went over to the Commission, they'd be asking affirmative relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.046" offset="10311555">In fact, I think whenever anyone assails the lawfulness of a published rate which until set aside as of course the legal rate, he is seeking affirmative relief and more specifically, the Court of Claims and only very recently the First Circuit have held that where the issue before the Court has to do with the lawfulness of the deductions made by the General Accounting Office, it is the Government which is in the position of seeking affirmative relief because it is seeking to justify the set offs it has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.582" offset="10461706">Now, there's a lot of talk about unfairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.836" offset="10474768">I don't know if we advanced analysis by bonding about epithets like unjust, unfair, discriminatory, I propose every losing litigant feels that he was dealt with unfairly otherwise he wouldn't try to take it up farther.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.786" offset="10542477">But is it unfair?</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.379" offset="10548851">Is it unfair to say that the Government that if you invoke the -- the -- the blunt techniques of the General Accounting Office and I will show in a minute just how blunt they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.715" offset="10594200">If you invoke those -- those techniques in cases which you say are so important that they're a fit subject to this Court on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.900" offset="10634951">Is it unfair that when you get licked on it and you've waived your right to go to the Commission a court says, “You can't go to the Commission”?</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.461" offset="10665253">And of course on the question of the six-year statute of limitations, I think, the answer there is that the Government could have raised it on the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.509" offset="10701406">They didn't raise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.406" offset="10709034">It isn't open here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.655" offset="10713945">Its not jurisdiction -- jurisdictional in the constitutional sense, these are rulings that have stood for 30 years just as the contrary rulings of the Government isn't bound by limitations when it sues for overcharges twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.751" offset="10774340">Seven years ago, the petition was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.891" offset="10786983">If the Government can now reopen denied petitions after seven years, I dare say that a lot of other litigants would like to be in that position.</text>

            <text syncTime="3134.691" offset="12642095">Now, the basic principle followed by the Court of Claims is a well-settled principle, namely, that the absence of essential parts not affecting the identity of an article offered for transportation doesn't destroy its fundamental character from the tariff's standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.697" offset="12710118">Also, the Court of Claims held that the combination rule didn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.362" offset="12728822">There is a very compelling reason why the combination rule doesn't apply and it's this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.692" offset="12758183">The combination rule applies -- does not apply to articles having the characteristic of an entity and these incendiary bombs without bursters or fuses do have the characteristic of an entity for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.960" offset="12823176">In the first place, you cannot accept with great difficulty, get the jellied gasoline out of the bomb case once it has been put in and second there is no known method by which the jellied gasoline can be separated into its component parts of napalm soap powder and liquid gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.369" offset="12904887">Therefore, the articles have the characteristic of an entity and therefore, the combination rule does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.306" offset="12936547">There is another argument made by the Government that these articles as shipped are not subject to the I.C.C.'s safety regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.323" offset="12996629">We think they are because the I.C.C. safety regulations cover a great many classes of articles not only the highly hazardous but also those lesser.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.071" offset="13043649">If it is material we can file a supplemental memorandum tracing this particular item through some seven titles, a very complicated and involved I.C.C. regulations published in 49 C.F.R. but it doesn't ask for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.481" offset="13121285">This Court has held in the case characteristically not cited or discussed by the Government that whether or not a particular article is subject to the safety regulations has absolutely no bearing on its classification for tariff purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.895" offset="13190980">That's the Gulf Refining case from the 268th United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.312" offset="13208639">So that applying -- applying those set of rules of classification that first that the absence of essential parts doesn't affect the character of the shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.472" offset="13257226">Second, that the combination rule is not applicable to articles having the characteristic of many.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.331" offset="13280737">And third, that the applicability or otherwise of the safety regulations has noting to do with tariff classification, the answer is clear of the Court of Claims correctly classified these shipments as incendiary bombs.</text>

            <text syncTime="4113.426" offset="16557119">Suit was filed by the carrier in 1954, four years after the latest payment and six years after the earliest payment.</text>

            <text syncTime="4204.529" offset="16921475">Actually this is really a provision that the carriers were insisting on putting in the 1940 Transportation Act because before that time the carriers did not get prompt payment, they had to wait until final audit by the General Accounting Office that they complained took too long a period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4219.880" offset="16982915">They were able to persuade Congress to require the Government to pay promptly, even if the Government had some doubt as to the appropriate classification.</text>

            <text syncTime="4234.884" offset="17042892">And that's precisely what happened in the Transportation Act of 1940.</text>

            <text syncTime="4273.841" offset="17198686">What they're really trying to do is to strip the Government completely of the post audit protection, Congress expressly reserved to it in this Transportation Act of 1940 as consideration for this prompt payment that the Government was required to make to the carriers.</text>
