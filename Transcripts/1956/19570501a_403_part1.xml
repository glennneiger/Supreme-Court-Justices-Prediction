            <label>Mr. John Caughlan</label>
            <text syncTime="18.456" offset="177194">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.184" offset="204152">The petitioner in this case was born a United States National in the Philippine Islands in 1910.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.473" offset="245217">He came to the United States as a non-excludable national in 1930 and has lived here ever since having acquired an American family and property.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.709" offset="314180">In 1951, he was convicted on his plea of guilty of a minor and technical violation of the narcotics law of United States to which he was given a suspended sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.256" offset="408430">About a month later, deportation proceedings were commenced against him on the grounds that he was an alien subject to deportation, having been convicted of a narcotics offense, under the Act of February 18th, 1931.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.416" offset="497037">And he was eventually ordered deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.827" offset="510725">However, the proceedings to deport him were stayed in 1952 by reason of the then tendency in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals of the case of Mangaoang against Boyd and Gonzales against Barber, the latter case reaching this Court on the Government's petition for certiorari as Barber against Gonzales.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.576" offset="625664">Following the decision by this Court of Barber against Gonzales, which rejected the Government's contention, that a Filipino who'd arrive in the United States before the 1934 Independence Act, was subject to deportation for an offense or for under -- on any grounds where statute provided for deportation after entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.414" offset="760978">Following that decision, the regional director immigration moved to reopen these proceedings for the purpose of having the Board of Immigration Appeals terminate the proceedings due taking other appropriate action.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.445" offset="829106">The Board, however, refused to do this on the grounds that the 1931 statute does not use in so many words the term, "entry", whereas the Act of 1917 uses specifically the terms after entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.796" offset="926595">It is our contention in this case that the term "after entry" or "entry", as used in the Immigration Act of 1917, is incorporated by reference in the 1931 Act, and that this case is fully controlled by the case of Barber against Gonzales.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.466" offset="1049266">The -- in the Barber case, as I've already stated, the question was whether under Section 19 (a) of the Immigration Act, an alien was subject to deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.855" offset="1098794">Section 19 (a) of the Immigration Act of 1917, which is quoted in full on pages 26 and 27 of the petitioner's brief, provides that any alien who is hereafter sentenced more than once to a term of imprisonment because of conviction in this country of any crime involving moral turpitude, committed in any time after entry shall be taken into custody and deport it.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.832" offset="1210702">And this Court held, of course, that entry means a coming into the United States from the outside and not simply an arrival here by a citizen or a national.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.999" offset="1259395">It is our contention that the 1917 Act, the very Act interpreted in Barber against Gonzales, applies to this case, first, because it is a necessary implication of any deportation statute that to be an entry that that is constitutionally implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.669" offset="1350092">Secondly, because the expressed language of reference in the 1931 Act does specifically incorporate the provisions of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.454" offset="1405158">Before considering the particular language of the 1931 Act, we urge and suggest that the term "entry" has a somewhat deeper significance than a mere term of art used in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.880" offset="1458866">We believe that it expresses the relationship between -- or other person who is subject to deportation to the constitutional source of the power to deport.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.804" offset="1518634">But in another way, a person on entering United States, on passing the exclusion barriers, and being admitted into this country is given a conditional license to remain here so long as he abides by the conditions imposed, or if the broadest interpretation, if the broadest construction of congressional power is -- is given, until Congress revokes the license.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.586" offset="1629706">While terms of sovereignty has been used with regard to aliens, we suggest that that applies to the external relations of United States and that the distinction between exclusion and deportation has been recognized in a long line of decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.783" offset="1702536">And that if the Tenth Amendment is to be given a force, the power to expel or deport must be implied from some provisions of the Constitution, from the standpoint of the internal policy of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.196" offset="1768155">As distinguished from its external policy, the power to deport is not unlimited.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.072" offset="1795636">The United States does not have the power to denationalize one with the right to be here, and thereupon, order him expelled to a foreign country or banished.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.180" offset="1864077">And we believe that this concept of sovereignty and distinguishing its internal and its external aspects has been well recognized from the earliest deportation cases after the present.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.617" offset="1921860">One rule applies to exclusion, and another to deportation, that deportation, in a sense, is simply a special instance of the power to exclude a reasonable and proper implication from the power to exclude and that absent of the power to exclude, there can be no power of any kind to deport.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.966" offset="2043277">We do not believe that Congress has ever suggested in any act that the power to deport exist apart from the power to exclude, and that deportation can be anything but a revocation of the license of the alien to come in to, to remain in the United States, it's not something separated in defendant because it's implied from the exclusion powers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1685.421" offset="6845106">The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals noted that the question was not in the Cabebe case which is cited in the brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1705.032" offset="6923473">The Court does go on to say that it believed that Congress intended to apply it to all Filipinos.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.786" offset="6946565">We do not believe, that a status as important as nationality, that a status as important as the right to remain, or that the deportation of an alien should be made to depend upon a statute which is capable of two different instruction -- constructions, one favorable to the alien, and one requiring deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.018" offset="7039457">We think that applies both to the 1931 Act which certainly can properly be construed as incorporating the entry sections of Sections 20 and 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.733" offset="7086268">We believe it equally applies to the Philippine Independence Act which can be construed has not applied to those Filipinos who came here as nationals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2020.082" offset="8183724">Barber-Gonzalez was -- versus Gonzalez was not concerned with the question of the manner of deportation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.703" offset="8234193">It stemmed from a deportation because of the 1917 Act, a provision in that Act which said, which require after entry, no dispute about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.862" offset="8294797">But our whole dispute in this Act is whether any requirement of entry is involved in this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.904" offset="8323009">And with that, I -- I go to the body of our contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.458" offset="8349236">The Government's position is that we have two inquiries here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.775" offset="8362506">First, what did Congress say?</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.587" offset="8377762">Secondly, was there any reason why Congress was not empowered to say this?</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.177" offset="8404093">Because, I will probably not reach the second matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.603" offset="8425827">I would also take a text from Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the sense that that second question, very extensively discussed in our brief, is a question of long history and I submit a very creditable page of history in which the United States from the outset, at all times, promised that Philippines' independence can deliver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.741" offset="8554350">It did not promised that the Philippine people in the United States would be granted something in addition here beyond their own independence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.990" offset="8591339">And in fact, such a grant of something -- of American citizenship taking them away from the Philippines would perhaps, in some degree, have been inconsistent with our protest nations and our actual conduct of giving them independence as we finally did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.511" offset="8673468">That history, as I say, and the citations of statutes in which from the outset, their whole status not only of the territory but of the peoples of the Philippines was left for future disposition and there was nothing, we submit, that could induce them ever to believe that they were going to get something permanent in the United States in addition to -- or rather in contradistinction from their own country factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.841" offset="8798751">Now, the question as to what this statute said, and in that, I think the Court would be much more interested in what the Congress said and what I have to say and I wonder in that -- for that purpose the statute isn't the best thing to look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.928" offset="8883075">I might summarize it before I go to text in line, it -- as our position being this, that that 1931 Act said that any alien –- any alien who after the enactment of the Act, which was February 18, 1951, any alien after February 1931 who should be convicted of a narcotics offense should be deported in the -- in manner provided in Sections 19 and 20, in manner provided in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.177" offset="9052035">Now, that word "in manner" -- just one further preliminary is -- does not come to us naked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.545" offset="9073560">It comes with the gloss of the decision of this Court in Bugajewitz in which Mr. Justice Holmes had squarely before him the question of distinguishing the words "in manner" from "as provided in."</text>

            <text syncTime="2456.087" offset="9927764">But if you go back to the 1922 Act, you will see, that's on page 11 of petitioner's brief, you will see that it says shall be taken into custody and deported in accordance –- no, I misspoke myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.361" offset="10008848">Upon what – it -- it provides what is not provided in the 1931 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.634" offset="10029955">It provides upon warrant issued by the Secretary of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.756" offset="10050435">Now, let me just speak very quickly as to what that distinction means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.726" offset="10066317">The early cases -- I'll accept the last relied upon by petitioner, said that Section 19 must have been incorporated because Section 19 just didn't have anything of manner in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.746" offset="10130369">And it pointed out, those cases have pointed out, that the 1922, this earlier Act which has been changed, provided who should issue that warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.107" offset="10175822">That is a matter of manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.251" offset="10188361">And they said, well, Section 19 must have been incorporated because there was nothing of manner to put into it but the 1931 Act has changed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.625" offset="10225873">It does not say who shall issue the warrant and who shall take him into custody and that is why we say that that manner provision now stands and you have to look to Section 19 to find out who it is that is to do -- do the deporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.490" offset="10289298">That's a matter of manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.003" offset="10295359">Now, I have finished with the 1931 Act and now I'm going to page 3 of the Government's brief where we begin Section 19 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.444" offset="10333184">Now, in looking at that, there are two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.139" offset="10343946">One, is there something of manner in that Section 19 that is incorporated into the Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.659" offset="10374040">How much, if it is carried over?</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.139" offset="10383966">And then the second question, is there so much talk, such exclusive talk of entry in there that the Congress in 1931 must have been talking about entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.837" offset="10426702">My answer to the latter question is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.547" offset="10437569">Section 19 is not so tied up with entry as I shall demonstrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.381" offset="10456900">And -- more – furthermore, there are elements of manner in here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2652.856" offset="10714781">Now, at the top of – at the top of page 3 and all the way down, that page is all substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.206" offset="10752188">It does not say how you shall deport, it says whom you shall deport.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.585" offset="10773713">If the precedes that moment where the determination of substance is made that someone shall be deported.</text>

            <text syncTime="2685.457" offset="10845184">So, if there's no reason for carrying any of that over, the Section 19 -- the 1931 Act tells you clearly enough who shall be deported, any alien who commits this offense after 1931.</text>

            <text syncTime="2761.322" offset="11148622">So, that I say when you look to what is the element of manner that is to be carried over into the 1931 Act, here it is, the designation of who is to do the deportee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.059" offset="11195643">I think that the question, who is to do the deportee, is a matter of manner, and that is carried over and that's about all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.003" offset="11223333">But there are some -- there are some provisos on page 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.056" offset="11259591">I direct your attention right after this clause which I've just reached, the 10th line from the bottom, there is an asterisk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.342" offset="11292714">And I'm sorry, I regret now but we took that part out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.535" offset="11313507">It is not completely pertinent but it's highly illuminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.293" offset="11328554">That asterisk covers a passage which says that if a female, after immorality -- after a certain statutory morality, marries a citizen, she does not gain citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.417" offset="11389053">Now, that is clearly not manner, it isn't even substantive on the subject of who shall be deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.063" offset="11415594">It is yet another aspect of Section 19 and obviously would not be carried over into 19 -- into the 1931 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.026" offset="11447463">I again use this to demonstrate that there are things to be carried over into the 1931 Act and there are things not to be carried over and the only thing to be carried over is manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.983" offset="11487274">Now that provision I've just adverted to is clearly not manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.460" offset="11505246">And then, there is another proviso to the effect that the provision of this Section shall not apply, that is the two moral turpitude cases, shall not apply if there is a pardon or if there is a recommendation by the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.298" offset="11592600">Now that, as to the carry over of that to the 1931 Act, there has been a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.259" offset="11628440">I am frank to say that I think that conflict arose on of very ill-advised lower court opinions which did not distinguish from the 1922 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.865" offset="11666787">Under the 1922 Act, as I've indicated, there was some ground for saying that when they said in the manner of 19 -- Section 19, they must have carried over the whole Act and the cases relied on by petitioners say that because there was no element of manner to refer to and so they said "This must be manner."</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.723" offset="11746304">I think that is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.112" offset="11751842">The (Inaudible) case which we cite says it's wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.096" offset="11763754">That's another circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.007" offset="11775352">And in the 1952 Act, I may say that the Congress at least has indicated what that Congress felt about it irrespective of the propriety of past interpretations and it has provided specifically that those suspension and -- and pardon provisions -- I shouldn't say suspension, I should say the pardon provisions of the judicial recommendation provisions do not carry over into the 1931 Act, whatever gloss that later opinion may give with its limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.386" offset="11912965">So that I submit to this Court that the – that the question of pardon and recommendation is not a matter of manner to carry over but it is not significant to the present case because they're not trying to carry over any pardon or recommendation idea of that -- nothing of a kind was given here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.001" offset="11983391">It is used by petitioner as an analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.784" offset="11994467">The petitioner's argument, as I conceded, is that if you carry over to the 1931 Act, the partner as being a matter of manner with an entry also that there's a broad purpose to carry over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.861" offset="12062804">Well, I think that that's not applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.014" offset="12071476">The case is unclear, they're not imported to this case where they're tying to carry over a sort of amorphous entry concept that is not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.259" offset="12104391">Now, I am plotting along through here because I still think that that is what's decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.343" offset="12132707">After that proviso, we -- there is -- there is one thing that's a little closer to manner on page 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.698" offset="12174190">About five lines down, you'll see, "Nor shall any -- any alien convicted as a aforesaid be deported until after determination of his imprisonment."</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.321" offset="12216613">Now, that is a matter of time of deportation and might conceivably be an element of manner and carried over to the 1931 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.084" offset="12255692">That again isn't conclusive here but it is pertinent to my contention that there were elements of manner that could be carried over and you don't have to look elsewhere and drag in matters of manner that are not manner but substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.942" offset="12315146">And then as you go down the -- then we come to the provision on which petitioner places his greatest reliance, on page 5, provided further -- I'm at line eight on page 5 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.495" offset="12377318">This is still the Section 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.095" offset="12387767">And this is the one that petitioner thinks indicates that unless you have entry, 1931 could not function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.532" offset="12417546">But we think it could -- can function very well and that this is not pertinent.Here is the proviso, provided further that the provisions of this Section with the exceptions here before noted, shall be applicable to the classes of aliens therein mentioned irrespective of the time of their entry in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.050" offset="12495600">I have just two things to say about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.112" offset="12503855">One, it is not a matter of manner, it is again a matter of substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.634" offset="12521932">It says, "This person shall be deported whether or not he came in to the United States at a certain time."</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.144" offset="12551920">In other words, it says who shall be deported not the manner of deportation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.286" offset="12572505">I don't think it carries over into the 1931 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.710" offset="12586193">But I have this further comment that even if it were carried over and written into that Act, it is still a negative thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.090" offset="12619734">It just says something if it happens shall not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.618" offset="12637811">But it certainly doesn't say that we shall carry over then that this has to happen.</text>
