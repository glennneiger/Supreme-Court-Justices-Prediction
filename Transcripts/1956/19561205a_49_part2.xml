            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">-- comment to make in closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.866" offset="162879">Before the recess, I was dealing with the Government's argument that the statute of limitations of the Court of Claims is a consent statute and so must be interpreted and construed differently from other statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.795" offset="246575">The -- and our answer to that point is that there's absolutely no reason why a consent statute of limitations should be construed any differently than a -- an ordinary statute of limitations or statute that creates and limits new rights, and I pointed to the Osborne case of the Second Circuit which dealt with a consent statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.857" offset="362768">Now, this argument of the Government was put forward in a case in the Supreme Court of Oregon, Peters against McKay in 1951, and the Court considered the entire argument at length and held that consent statute or not, it was suspended by war.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.465" offset="453256">They said there that -- and pointed their argument there, they pointed out that where the State consents to be sued and then by recognition of its rules of international law and common law, closes its courts to the litigants, they thereby deny the privilege which they granted and that you must have some construction of the statute that avoids absurdity.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.360" offset="568822">And they felt that it was not conceivable that the same hand which gave the right to sue should with the other hand withhold it while -- and both be in operation at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.805" offset="630575">The comment of the -- the Court commented on the nursery rhyme.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.588" offset="653772">They said that the law does not follow the precedent of the nursery rhyme, “Hang your clothes on the hickory limb but don't go near the water.”</text>
            <text syncTime="145.538" offset="685537">And that's exactly the same -- the same situation here.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.363" offset="844779">I would like at the outset to state the position of the Government on the two basic issues now before this Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.705" offset="878216">I'll then take up each issue in turn in more detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.230" offset="896293">The first issue is the one on which certiorari was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.968" offset="911235">The issue was raised in the petition whether members of the Philippine Army, who were recognized in certain ways, found in certain categories, were members of the armed forces of the United States for procurement purposes so at requisitioning of supplies could create debts of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.297" offset="988557">It's an issue of status and authority, whether the status of this group of people, the Philippine guerrillas, who were later recognized or who were recognized contemporaneously was such that they have authority to create direct obligation upon the United States Government by their procurement, their requisitioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.071" offset="1063685">On this issue, our position is that they did not -- had no such authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.994" offset="1087300">Although, the Philippine Government was not holding independent, prior to July 4th, 1946, they were a semi-sovereign or quasi-sovereign, had some independence.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.350" offset="1124812">That was the position of United States from 1941 until 1946 when the Philippines required full independence to treat them with as much independence as was consistent with their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.507" offset="1185416">The assistant -- financial assistance which United States gave to the Philippine Army was handled in such a way, it was handled in much the way that assistance to other governments was handled --</text>

            <text syncTime="283.855" offset="1238810">I hate to interrupt you but -- but how did we treat them in relation to such matters as this during that period between 1941 and 1946?</text>

            <text syncTime="315.069" offset="1363675">We handled that through the Philippine Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.210" offset="1372244">The United States advanced several hundred million dollars about -- around $300 million to the Philippine Government to be used to meet those expenses of the Philippine Army with -- of which General MacArthur approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.821" offset="1418637">He had a veto power on this military assistance as other aid missions have had and other military assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.089" offset="1443715">These funds were advanced to the Government, put in the Philippine Treasury with the agreement that they would be only used for those purposes of the army of which we -- we, that is General MacArthur which the American Army Commander, approved those funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.761" offset="1498467">There are still funds in their -- in the Philippine Treasury beyond those required to meet the claims which have been approved and the return of these funds was the matter under discussion between the two governments right now.</text>
