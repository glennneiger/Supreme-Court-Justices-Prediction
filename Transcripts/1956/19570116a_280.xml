            <label>Mr. Peter W. Billings</label>
            <text syncTime="16.785" offset="170506">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.662" offset="190046">I believe that perhaps this, the third of these three cases, brings in clearest focus the issue which has tied the three together.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.705" offset="230170">That is the question of whether 10 (a) provides the exclusive manner in which States may attempt to regulate unfair labor practices as defined in the Act when they affect interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.949" offset="299133">In this case, the appellant is engaged in the manufacture of special photographic equipment for the Air Force.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.967" offset="343228">I -- I think he most ably fits this definition of a borderline industry so far as interstate commerce is concerned as used in the statutory history of Section 10 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="70.808" offset="386591">The total amount of these three contracts was around $150,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.950" offset="407176">He purchased about $50,000 worth of materials from outside of the State and delivered the finished special equipment to the Air Force to bases both inside the State of Utah and in other Air Force bases throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.880" offset="482931">He had his employee according to the ballot conducted by the NLRB, 26 employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.439" offset="521174">Soon after he started performance of these, the three contracts, the Steelworkers Union filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board for certification of the steelworkers as the bargaining representative for his employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.994" offset="587316">And the day that the hearing was set on such petition, the union and Mr. Guss entered into an agreement for a consent election to be conducted by the NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.226" offset="640293">That was -- and that election was conducted in May of 1954 and the Steelworkers Union prevailed by a vote of 15 to -- 25 to 11 and the union was duly certified by the National Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.841" offset="714689">Very shortly after, within a week after that certification was issued, the union filed with the National Board a complaint alleging unfair labor practices, both in the conduct of the election in the alleging discriminatory discharges of some of these employees and a refusal to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.259" offset="804446">And thereupon, the National Board conducted an investigation of these charges between that day and July of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.066" offset="835688">In other words, just over a couple of months.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.744" offset="846346">On July 1st and July 15th of 1954, the Board came down with its new jurisdictional yardsticks under terms of which the appellant here clearly fall without.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter W. Billings</label>
            <text syncTime="209.064" offset="939656">Yes, Your Honor, they have not been changed except as in case -- by case determination.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>

            <label>Mr. Peter W. Billings</label>
            <text syncTime="216.212" offset="968182">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.750" offset="974346">And so on July 21st, 1954, the regional director of the National Board advised the union that he would not process their -- further their complaint on the ground that it would not effectuate the policies of the Act for the National Board to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.703" offset="1054177">The -- thereupon, without any appeal to the National Board as the letter of declination invited, the union filed almost exactly the same charge with the Utah Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.618" offset="1129827">And within a few months, the -- the Utah Board held a hearing and made the determinations from which this appeal was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.303" offset="1172564">The Utah Board is set up under the Utah Act which is -- which might be characterized as a little Wagner Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.219" offset="1208299">It was passed in 1937 shortly after the Wagner Act was passed by the National Congress and was patterned on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.102" offset="1239751">Instead of talking about interstate commerce or affecting interstate commerce as the National Act did, it uses the words intrastate commerce and the orderly operation of industry and is ministered by a Board similar to the National Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.111" offset="1315819">However, in 1947, it was again amended to add certain unfair labor practices of employer -- of employees as well as employers, but it was not amended to conform to the Taft-Hartley Act which was passed in the same year and it has not been since amended, so that everyone here concerned in this case concedes that the Utah statute does not meet the requirements of Section 10 (a), that it -- it does not have consistent corresponding provisions to the National Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.015" offset="1491466">Some of the particular differences which might be pointed out are that the Utah Act has no provision for the filing of non-Communist affidavits by union officers and by the filing of financial reports by unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.218" offset="1564296">It does not provide for the 60-day cooling-off period for the respective strikes and it has different standards for the determination of a bargaining unit in the first place, so there are real and substantial differences in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.700" offset="1642141">We raised the issue of the power of the State Board to issue any order in this action at the commencement of the hearing and throughout that hearing and appeal under the state statutory procedure to the Utah Supreme Court raising the same issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.151" offset="1727927">And that was the only issue passed upon by the Utah Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.719" offset="1750288">The Utah court affirmed the decision of the State Board that it had jurisdiction on the basis that there was intrastate as well as interstate commerce involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.473" offset="1809220">Relying on the decision of the California court in the Garmon case which came out only a few weeks before this case was decided and arguing that unless it did so, this so-called “no man's land” would prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.756" offset="1886438">Now, I think that this case I have here has these distinctions from the two which we have heard before.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.246" offset="1932309">One, and I think perhaps the most important that here, there is a state board and a state statute involved rather than a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.987" offset="1975359">Secondly, the National Board actually asserted jurisdiction in the proceedings and then within -- within two months after that, declined to exercise jurisdiction over unclaimed unfair labor practices arriving -- rising out -- out of the very election which the National Board had conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.394" offset="2068982">And thirdly, different from the other two, is an employer here who is raising the issue, point being that the sword of exclusiveness of 10 (a) cuts both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.898" offset="2138990">We join with counsel for the unions in the two preceding cases in our position that based on the express language of 10 (a) based on its legislative history, it provides the only, the exclusive manner in which the States may act in matters affecting interstate commerce where there are parallel provisions between state and federal law, and this is certainly one of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.569" offset="2285693">We have the same pattern in our statute as is in the national statute for the certification of a union for election to be conducted by a Board and for a Board to hear charges of unfair labor practices of both employees and employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.018" offset="2375450">But aside from that same general framework as I have pointed out, there are -- are real and substantial differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.978" offset="2411290">And of course, one of the most important from the standpoint of an employer and his employees who may be members of the union which is seeking to organize his employees is a question of -- of Sections 9 (f) and (g) of the National Act which require the union before it can avail itself of the National Board to file the non-Communist affidavit of its officers and the provisions which require the union officers to file financial statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.390" offset="2548903">Those protections are not given in the Utah Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.108" offset="2567816">So that if the Utah Act is applied, certainly, this employer and his employees are deprived of rights given to them under the National Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.156" offset="2631973">Therefore, if the Board can do as it attempted to do in this case and merely by declining to act, place jurisdiction in the State Board, it can do that which Congress said it couldn't do and that is make an employer who's been as affects interstate commerce subject to statutes which are different from the national.</text>

            <text syncTime="671.254" offset="2788394">As I read Section 10 (a), Your Honor, it says in any cases and then it sets down at the -- in those cases, the state statute must have corresponding provisions not inconsistent with the federal statute, and I would think it would have to do it by general categories and not on a case-by-case basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1103.844" offset="4518745">I agree with my opponent -- opposing counsel here that this case is a little different in the two previously presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.006" offset="4551346">Here in this case, we have a specific refusal by the -- the National Board to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.682" offset="4578095">We have an action by a state board which is fully consistent with the Federal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.383" offset="4600874">And thirdly, we have a comprehensive labor relations statute in Utah which almost does not exactly correspond with the National Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.701" offset="4638177">It does provide at least a guarantee of the basic rights provided in Section 7 and 8 and certainly, was consistent with the National Act in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.730" offset="4690317">In that regard, I'd like to read if I may from the decision of the Utah Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.278" offset="4716440">It stated, “In the present case, there are no allegations that either party was deprived of rights which it might have obtained under the federal law had the NLRB heard the charges presented to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.245" offset="4764400">There are in fact, no intimations that the National Board would have disposed of the matter in a way other than which the State Board did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.726" offset="4798255">No subsidy conflicts between the provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act concerning unfair labor practices and the Utah Code have been alleged nor do any appear with reference to the particular charges involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.090" offset="4859695">Since we discovered no conflict with federal authority in this case and since the values of immediate legal supervision of labor and controversies within this company can only be maintained through state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.132" offset="4915911">We hold that the Utah State Labor Relations Board had jurisdiction in this matter and affirmed its decision in order.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.526" offset="4953527">Now, it seems from listening to the arguments that have gone on today relating to this question that there's a particular concern about Section 10 (a) of the federal act as to whether or not that prevents the National Board from declining jurisdiction in particular cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.885" offset="5034924">I think we have to start out with the proposition that there's a presumption in favor of state jurisdiction in the absence of something expressly to the contrary in the federal act or in the federal decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.066" offset="5091662">Assuming that presumption, then I think we can turn to cases such as the Welch versus New Hampshire, Northwest Telephone versus Nebraska, Missouri Railway versus Larabee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.157" offset="5144012">In those cases, there you had a federal law, another federal administrative body, empowered and directed in some cases to institute rules of procedure and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.378" offset="5200854">However, in these cases, the federal administrative body did not take affirmative action in -- at the time these cases arose in designating the various rights or rules and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.577" offset="5261667">And it was held in all of those cases that where the Federal Government has created administrative bodies which could take care of these matters by regulation or otherwise but have not, then the State's jurisdiction applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.502" offset="5329377">As you recall in the Welch case, that involved the Interstate Commerce Commission which was authorized to promulgate rules relating to the length of hours which a truck driver might drive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.798" offset="5386533">New Hampshire had a state law but I think allowing him to drive for 12 hours, and the ICC came along with the regulation for eight hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.266" offset="5424462">But before that went into effect, the Court held that the state laws applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.012" offset="5447450">Now, it concerns me about this “no man's land” as they termed it because of the economic impact, I think that a decision as advocated by my opponent would follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.007" offset="5519444">As pointed out in the amicus curiae brief of the State of New York, over 90% of the businesses in the United States have less than 20 employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.221" offset="5564270">As a consequence, it would be an almost impossible task, I believe, for the National Board with its limited resources and personnel to handle each and every case that might arise in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.102" offset="5619754">The proper place for it, I think, is with the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.320" offset="5632606">And certainly, the mere fact that the state law might differ from the National Act is no argument against to permitting them to act when the Federal Government declines to act because I think some regulation is better than none at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.428" offset="5713063">If our adversaries are correct, you're going to have a law of the jungle when it -- it applies to these “no man land” cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1973.213" offset="7996270">You have the case that was before you at that time regarding the -- the certifying of the foremen's union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.187" offset="8024168">And there it was held that the Board's declination of jurisdiction in that particular field was because its declination was in the nature of a decision and then you reserved the question of declination for budgetary reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.314" offset="8084668">Now, Congress had that decision before it when it enacted 10 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.965" offset="8103267">Now, I think if you read that act, it says, “Provided that the Board is empowered by agreement with any agency of any State or territory to cede such agency jurisdiction over any cases in any industry.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.768" offset="8178395">Now, they are speaking more than just to these cases that were declined because of budgetary reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.311" offset="8200652">Under the language of this proviso, the Board concedes its jurisdiction to a state agency on any case regardless of the effect that the particular case might have on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.591" offset="8265749">There's no restriction here except for these limited few such as mining, manufacturing and so forth where they say there that they can only cede jurisdiction when it's predominantly of a local character.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.356" offset="8316844">Now, in my opinion, that exception that is put in here relating to mining and manufacturing and transportation and so forth indicates, at least to me, that the intent of Congress was not to be regulating or doing away with the powers of the States to act where the Board had declined jurisdiction but on the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.828" offset="8402735">It seems to me it's a recognition of them.</text>
