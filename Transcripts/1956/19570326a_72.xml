            <label>Mr. Roger D. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="147.760" offset="694418">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.749" offset="702360">This case and the companion case to be argued immediately after it are deportation cases which involve the construction of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.434" offset="761083">They both reached this Court on certiorari from the Sixth Circuit, and they both turned on a single question of whether the 1952 Act made persons deportable who were not deportable just prior to that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.361" offset="824822">The Act itself make persons theretofore, not deportable, deportable respondent Carson in this case, a native and citizen of Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.534" offset="881560">He entered the United States as -- in 1919 as a stowaway.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.432" offset="905070">Stowaways at that time were among the classes then excluded by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.048" offset="923564">This was an illegal entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.958" offset="931192">Under the law at that time, if he'd been found within five years, he should have been deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.861" offset="950836">Under the law he would have been deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.349" offset="968808">In 1936, he was convicted of two separate -- on two separate occasions for the crime of blackmail.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.417" offset="1017083">Shortly after that, 1937, while he was still in prison for those offenses, a deportation proceeding under the old Act was begun.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.944" offset="1059192">This was continued when he got out of prison in 1941 and -- but by -- in 1945, Governor Lausche of Ohio gave him a conditional pardon for one of the two blackmail offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.411" offset="1121050">Under the law as it then existed, a conditional pardon was a sufficient pardon to bring one out of the deportation ground which was two crimes involving moral turpitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.837" offset="1186670">The next -- the new -- this present deportation proceeding was begun in 1953, on the terms of the 1952 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.612" offset="1221778">There was a hearing, he was ordered deported by the inspection inquiry officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.910" offset="1242990">The order was affirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.105" offset="1255842">Respondent filed petition for habeas corpus in January, 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.711" offset="1278203">The District Court denied the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.950" offset="1291160">The Court of Appeals through the Sixth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.268" offset="1312475">The United States petitioned for certiorari to this Court to review this construction of the Act, and because of a conflict with the Gagliano against Bonds in the Fifth Circuit and because we submit the conflict with the Marcello decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.514" offset="1405471">The present deportation is based on two grounds, both under the present Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.614" offset="1433788">I'll get to them in more detail, but one is the stowaway, the illegal entry in 1919.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.445" offset="1469106">The second is the two crimes involving moral turpitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.519" offset="1485406">Under the 1952 Act, a conditional pardon is not adequate to prevent deportation for two such crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.992" offset="1527306">It is agreed by the Government that prior to the adoption of the 1952 Act, Carson was not deportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.260" offset="1560430">The deportation provisions of the Act on their face, however, make respondent deportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.278" offset="1592508">There the -- these two grounds both raised the same issue, the issue of retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.202" offset="1620198">That the -- in construing the statute there are two sections which we are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.954" offset="1639215">The first is section 241, which outlines the grounds for deportation, and second is section 405, the general savings clause at the end of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.094" offset="1687698">The Government contends that Section 241 is a specific provision which specifically provides that aliens who've done the things that Carson in this case and Catalanotte in the next case have done, shall be deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.227" offset="1752273">The savings clause, on upon which respondents rely, does not apply to cases where it is otherwise specifically provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.366" offset="1792815">The second contention is that in any event, respondent Carson here and Catalanotte, in the other case, did not have any status or other rights of the kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.081" offset="1851747">They were carried forward by the savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.038" offset="1863555">The mere failure of Congress to provide for their deportation earlier did not confer upon them a non-deportable status which would protect them against the provisions of the new law.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.635" offset="1917889">Before getting to the legislative history in the construction of these, this section, section 241, has been before this Court twice before.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.591" offset="1953729">In Schaumburg against the United States, decided in April, 1955, the Court held that the petitioner could not be naturalized while there was a pending deportation proceeding under this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.083" offset="2011721">The Court at that time explicitly left open the question being argued today, that the savings clause might protect them from the deportation charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.105" offset="2047770">During the next month, section 241 was again before this Court in the Marcello case, Marcello against Bonds in 349 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.526" offset="2089462">The factual situation there is parallel to that here and identical to that in the Catalanotte case.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.889" offset="2118928">Marcello, who had been -- had a narcotics conviction in 1938 under statute which at the time did not make him deportable, was not deportable prior to 1952 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.558" offset="2173576">This Court there found that section 241 was retroactive, in that made a conviction at any time a ground for deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.213" offset="2216208">In view of this decision, the Court went on and had to face the constitutional question of whether the 1952 Act was constitutional as -- or was it against the ex post facto provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.959" offset="2267199">The Court found the statute to be valid.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harold_burton" startTime="543.814" stopTime="545.712">
            <label>Justice Harold Burton</label>
            <text syncTime="543.814" offset="2278588">It's because it's a civil case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="roger_d_fisher" startTime="545.712" stopTime="683.102">
            <label>Mr. Roger D. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="545.712" offset="2286216">Because it's a civil case, because its deportation not punished, is not a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.559" offset="2305651">The Marcello case would be controlling here but for respondent's contention that this Court did not explicitly consider the savings clause and whether that clause overcame the provisions for section 241.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.528" offset="2365524">In Marcello, the petitioner in that case filed a supplemental petition for certiorari raising the savings clause question.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.123" offset="2403871">It was denied and although the savings clause was mentioned in both briefs it was not argued before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.209" offset="2436159">The Court, however, had one month before had both the Menasche and Schaumberg cases devote exclusively to the savings clause and the record in the Marcello case raised the savings clause at which had been considered by the Board of Immigration Appeals below.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.872" offset="2498853">The Court did not explicitly consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.948" offset="2507212">Certiorari has been granted on these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.489" offset="2521318">And we'll now go to the question of whether section 241, which this Court found to be retroactive and which respondent concedes is retroactive on its face is overcome by the general savings clause section 405 at the end of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.744" offset="2598327">The Government contends that the Marcello construction of the statute is correct, and that under the 1952 Act, aliens were made deportable who were not theretofore deportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.216" offset="2656214">Respondent's decision is that section 241 is not a specific provision from the meaning of the savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.134" offset="2687875">It does not specifically provide that this person should be deported, they said.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.702" offset="2710131">He can -- respondent contends that persons nondeportable under the old Act had a certain nondeportable status which was saved under the language of the old Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.272" offset="2760495">I'd like -- before -- I'll come to this later.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.819" offset="2770631">But respondent's construction of the statute completely eliminates the retroactive effect of all the language in section 241 because anybody who was not deportable before would not be made deportable under the new provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="691.859" offset="2870836">But to be specifically -- to be accepted from 405, there must be reference to 405.</text>

            <text syncTime="709.682" offset="2942098">I'd like to turn to the language of the statute and then take up the history of these two sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.298" offset="2964564">For the convenience of the Court, we have reprinted the entire section 241 in the back of the Government's reply brief in number 72.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.805" offset="3002598">It ran some nine pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.865" offset="3018794">We've put in boldface type the -- the wording that has to do with the timing of the offense whether it should be before or after entry, before the Act, after the Act at anytime, this has been put in boldface to show the concern which the Congress had for this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.079" offset="3095698">I'd like to take for example on page 85 in the appendix of the reply brief, section 241 (a) (11) at the bottom of the Act relating to narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.153" offset="3152018">Here in one paragraph, I think as clearly as anywhere else, you can see the timing and the concern of Congress that this be retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.024" offset="3191515">This is the section under which respondent Catalanotte in the next case is being deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.577" offset="3217638">Section 11 -- 241 (a) (11) reads, "That anyone should be deported who is or hereafter at any time after entry has been a narcotic drug addict or who at anytime has been convicted of a violation of any law or regulation relating to the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs."</text>
            <text syncTime="803.911" offset="3318993">I think the contrast between that hereafter relating to the addicts and who, at any time, has been convicted relating to persons convicted of traffic and narcotics indicates on its face a retroactive intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.265" offset="3380433">Any doubt, as to the intent of Congress by looking at the language itself of the statute, should be removed by section 241 (d) which appears on page 89 of the appendix to our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.311" offset="3444590">Except as otherwise specifically provided in this section, the provisions of this section shall be applicable to all aliens belonging to any of the classes enumerated in subsection (a) -- that's the section we're concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.843" offset="3502791">Notwithstanding, that any such alien enter the United States prior to the date of enactment of this Act or (2), that the facts by reason of which any such alien belongs to any of the classes enumerated in subsection (a) occurred prior to the date of enactment of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.015" offset="3591398">Faced with this language, respondent is compelled to admit that 241 is retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.781" offset="3638523">They -- on page 28 of respondent's brief, "We admit as did the court below that some provisions of section 241 are retroactive and that others are not."</text>
            <text syncTime="897.781" offset="3694529">Where a prospective application of section 241 was desired, the word "hereafter" was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.452" offset="3721174">Except as provided in section 241, section 241(d) made the deportation provisions retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.025" offset="3755447">Now I don't know what respondent means by saying that it is retroactive and then coming around and saying that the savings clause takes this all away.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.461" offset="3793168">The savings clause under respondent's contention means that no person can be deported by reason of fact that occurred prior to the date of an Act unless under prior law they were made deportable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1531.947" offset="6231124">The very section which I referred to you previously, subsection (11) (241) in the first bill had said, "Anyone who has been convicted of a violation of any law pertaining to narcotics."</text>

            <text syncTime="2029.495" offset="8221341">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.051" offset="8227610">As we hear the Government's oral presentation this afternoon, and as we read its briefs not only on the Carson case but in the Catalanotte case which follows, we hear only two ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.609" offset="8277765">The first argument that the Government makes is that retrospectivity of section 241 (d) and of the other section of provisions of section 241 in and of itself constitutes an exception to the savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.674" offset="8342026">For reasons which I shall develop, we believe this is only the beginning of the argument, neither the end of the argument nor the answer to the question which the Court is concerned with as the Government has sought to make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.303" offset="8392600">The second argument, it seems to me, is one of the less sapient ideas ever to have emanated from the Solicitor General's office and that is, that the question whether an alien is deportable or nondeportable, does not present a question of status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.514" offset="8453413">Now, apart from the broad sweep of the language of the savings clause which this Court had discussed in the Menasche case, the Solicitor General comes to this issue like a lexicographer, not even as a dictionary but with senate legislative history trying to make the word "status" a word of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.642" offset="8525928">Now, it is clear that by use of the word "status," by use of the word "condition," by use of the very broad phraseology in the section 405 of the 1952 Act, Congress had no such intent that it was to be restricted as a word of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.206" offset="8588204">The Act at dozens of places refers to the position of an alien who is deport -- who was pure lawfully and one who therefore by the outburst meaning who is here not lawfully as a question of status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.384" offset="8636897">In section 244 itself, the suspension of deportation provisions Congress has referred to the position of an alien who is deportable being adjusted to the position of an alien who shall no longer be deportable as a question of status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.979" offset="8695306">So, I shall not dwell long on that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.024" offset="8707427">We should concentrate most of our attention on what is the essential, the key issue before the Court, and that is whether the provisions in section 241 and particularly in 241 (d), which make the Act admittedly retrospective in many features is the specific provision which is intended by section 405 (a) of the savings clause and meets -- meet the degree of specificity which is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.635" offset="8817873">At the outset, we believe that Mr. Justice Clark in speaking for the Court in the Schaumburg decision, has disposed of all the Government has had to say on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.783" offset="8858520">In that decision, Mr. Justice Clark stated that if the grounds for deportation are the same under the prior law, as under the new Act, then nothing in the new Act affects the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.557" offset="8909615">Only where there's something in the new Act which introduces a change thereby, affecting one's status under the old law is the savings clause called into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.175" offset="8956113">Only then is a specific exception to 405 required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.526" offset="8977429">Now, the case which the Court has before it, it is only because section 241 (a) (1) of the 1952 Act eliminated the statute of limitations with respect to stowaways and was only because section 241 (a) (1) by its language is admittedly retrospective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.668" offset="9054020">It is only because section 241 (b) removed the immunity to deportation which had obtained previously for aliens who had conditional pardons for crimes involving moral turpitude and it is only because section 241 (d) in the Act makes the provisions of the foregoing clauses in section 241 retrospective that the offenses which this alien has committed have become deportable offenses under the new Act, not under the old Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.469" offset="9181288">It is only then that the savings clause becomes operative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.925" offset="9199052">So far from being an exception to the savings clause, all of the -- all of the language which the Government has set forth in his reply brief in blackface type and all of the argument which the Government has made to Your Honors this afternoon, far from being the exceptions as I say, those very provisions had been what have triggered the savings clause into action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.604" offset="9289749">For this reason alone, not section 241 (a) (1), not section 241 (a) (4), and not section 241 (d) can be construed to be exceptions to the savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.414" offset="9341053">But we feel that we have more than the logic of the case on our side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.347" offset="9356727">We have what we feel is the specific legislative history of the 1952 Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2347.216" offset="9492250">And they've made that specific reference and that specific suggestion with regard to 405 (b) and I was intending to draw upon that later.</text>

            <text syncTime="2411.145" offset="9747937">And I shall explain my reasons for that, Mr. Justice Burton, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.258" offset="9764446">Now, as I was saying this for its version of the legislative history, all the Government has had to show is the sharp hostility which it says and admittedly it is true that Congress had for stowaways and its intent to effect deportation provisions retrospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.528" offset="9833514">But what is relative to the issue are not the general hostility to stowaways or its attitude toward narcotics or whether they wished to have the retrospective effect of the law, but what is -- what is essential is whether intended 241 (d) to be a specific exception to 405 of the savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.461" offset="9909164">Now, as my Brother Fisher has pointed out, the genesis of the Immigration Nationality Act was Senate Bill 3455 which was introduced by Senator McCarran in the 81st Congress in April of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.279" offset="9960469">It was the culmination of three or four years of study of immigration laws and is intended to be a codification of all that had gone before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.327" offset="9996727">Now it is very significant that in that statute Congress omitted -- and this that my Brother Fisher has pointed out, it omitted a savings clause with respect to deportation provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.299" offset="10044583">And it was more than an omission and unconscious omission because the 1917 Immigration Act did have a savings clause with respect to deportation offenses which carried forward as Mr. Justice Clark summarized the history of savings clause as in the Menasche case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.219" offset="10112293">Now, when Senator McCarran introduced Senate Bill 3455 he, it would seem to me by the very fact that it was omitted from the deportation provisions, omitted that with regard to deportation and confined it solely to naturalization and nationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.651" offset="10173942">And it was included in title 3 and made applicable only with regard to the matter set forth in title 3 namely, naturalization and nationality matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.847" offset="10214797">Now, one would -- now in the -- the second bill bearing on the issue was Senate Bill 716 which was introduced some nine months later in the 81st Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.545" offset="10257533">Now, my Brother Fisher seems to indicate that it was a simply a matter of moving it from one title to another title.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.809" offset="10278640">But it was far from that because it was introduced in 716, the language of it was changed, whereas, before the savings clause said nothing contained in this title unless otherwise specifically provided therein and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.920" offset="10335065">When it was put in title 4 of the Act in the miscellaneous title, the clause stated, nothing contained in this Act shall etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.677" offset="10374040">Now, obviously, to change the word from title to Act is more than a question of moving it from one House to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.720" offset="10398281">It's giving the savings clause a much larger umbrella, one which covers not only deportation but exclusion in all the other provisions in the -- in the Immigration and Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.257" offset="10444361">Now, one would suppose that at section 241 (d) or any provisions in section 241 were intended to be an exception to the savings clause that that phrase, that clause would have come into the Act at the same time that the savings clause was made applicable to the Act at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.861" offset="10522833">As my Brother Fisher has pointed out, section 241 (d) was there all along.It was there at the very beginning when there was no applicability of the savings clause to deportation offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.311" offset="10572570">Now, for the purpose -- and I'm directing myself now to the questions which Mr. Justice Burton and Mr. Justice Harlan had asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.611" offset="10597857">The purpose we feel of section 241 (d) was at least two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.240" offset="10624293">Its first purpose and we insist on this very strongly and we believe that the question which -- that my Brother Fisher has directed to Mr. Justice Harlan is based on a false premise and is an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.147" offset="10671940">The first purpose of the Act of 241 (d) was to continue the deportability of those aliens who were deportable under the prior statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.685" offset="10710079">Now, we say that was necessary because section 403 of the Act repealed all prior immigration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.299" offset="10740590">To say that title 1 of -- 109 of title 1, the General Savings Clause, would be applicable to deportation provisions is a novel and a fresh suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.399" offset="10788968">It has never been relied upon by the Immigration Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.570" offset="10801612">We doubt very much whether that Congress intended it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.764" offset="10814464">The 109 says very specifically that it's applicable to penalties, forfeitures and liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.733" offset="10842258">Now, this Court has said much to our chagrin, as attorneys for aliens, that a deportation is not a penalty or a forfeiture and that we have urged that upon the Court and with respect to the ex post facto argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.648" offset="10890010">Whether it is a liability is far from certain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.346" offset="10904743">And I'm certain -- if I am certain of anything that the General Savings Clause was not relied upon by Senator McCarran when he deleted the savings clause from the deportation provisions of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.088" offset="10959705">If that were so, even if we assume the correctness of the Government's argument, the very fact that in the second bill, in Senate Bill 716, the savings clause was made applicable to deportation matters, we believe is an argument which is a grease to our mill because the General Savings Clause, the Title 1 Savings Clause, is one which -- is a one way street in favor of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.173" offset="11052074">It permits the Government to conduct prosecutions and suits and proper action for penalties, liabilities and forfeitures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.218" offset="11080286">But the savings clause in 405 protects both the Government and the alien.Indeed, the Solicitor General in his brief to this Court in the Menasche case indicated that was the very purpose of the savings clause, to protect the public as well as the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.470" offset="11141204">So, if that argument of the Government be correct we feel that it supports our proposition that 405 was intended to protect an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.073" offset="11175685">But we believe that not only this 241 (d) was made necessary to continue forward the old grounds of deportability, but it was needed to support deportability even under the new Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.857" offset="11222810">And this we believe is very important because far from being a nullity, 241 (d), if it were absent from the Act, would make the deportation provisions which the Government takes to enforce some of them a novelty – a nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.205" offset="11280175">Now, there are some, we've been told there are some 700 grounds of deportation set forth in the new statute and it's very difficult in a half hour to go into and -- and apply immigration law session to apply each one of the 700 grounds with respect to restrospectivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.158" offset="11344018">I will discuss, however, very limitedly the applicability of 241 (a) (4) which is the section that the Court is concerned with in our case if 241 (d) were missing from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.010" offset="11391457">Suppose an alien entered the United States in 1950 prior to the effective date of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and committed a deportable offense, a crime involving moral turpitude within five years from 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.455" offset="11445164">Suppose, he committed it 1953, as 241 (a) (4) reads, "It provides that an alien shall be deported who is convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude committed within five years after entry."</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.261" offset="11528443">The very first problem the Government would have is a problem of the word "entry."</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.848" offset="11546728">Normally a -- any statute is construed prospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.807" offset="11562611">If two -- if the first section of 241 (a) -- 241 (d) were not in the statute, namely, the one providing that entry shall be an entry notwithstanding, that the alien entered the United States prior to the date of enactment of this Act, an alien who entered in 1950 but who committed a deportable offense in 1953 could not be reached by this provision without 241 (d)'s first section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.039" offset="11671489">Suppose a second case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.872" offset="11678908">An alien entered the United States in 1930.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.067" offset="11691656">He commits a crime involving moral turpitude in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.069" offset="11707643">15 years after his entry, he's not deportable under the old statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.721" offset="11730213">He commits a second crime involving moral turpitude in 1954, that being after the date of the new Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.278" offset="11760515">Unless 241 (d) was there to make the -- the second section of it notwithstanding, the facts by reason of which he would belong in (a) (4), unless that were in there, that alien could not be deported under the new Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.721" offset="11818297">So we believe that 241 (d), as we construe it, is no nullity at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.403" offset="11840972">That it was there for the very express purpose of continuing all the grounds of deportability and of making effective the deportation provisions under the new Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.717" offset="11882245">There's an additional reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.811" offset="11890604">As the Government's appendix has pointed out, there are many time sequences set forth in 241 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.684" offset="11918085">Some were hereafter.Some were has-beens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.769" offset="11926444">Some were at the time of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.707" offset="11934177">Some were at anytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.586" offset="11941700">241 (d), we submit, is a general clause designed to make it clear that with respect to the new law, Congress wanted it to be retrospective except as the time sequence in 80 -- at 241 (a) provided a different provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.898" offset="12010977">So, we think that the savings clause can be construed consistently with 241 (d) and at the same time keeping 241 (d) far from a nullity but an implement of providing deportation for the alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.762" offset="12066461">Now, there's a footnote to our legislative history which we think is very significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.056" offset="12087568">And I comment upon it because the Government keep -- keeps dangling the phrase “magical passwords” before us in order to overcome the lack of specificity in 241 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.992" offset="12139290">In its reply brief, the Government has stated on page 6 that the origin of the savings clause is part of the naturalization provisions also explains why it is only in the naturalization sections of the 1952 Act that there are stated exceptions to the savings clause and then only to section 405 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.510" offset="12225390">Now, I can state categorically upon the basis of the legislative analysis which has been lodged with the Court, that this is just not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.348" offset="12256737">The original bill, Senate Bill 3455 contained within it an explanation of the origin of that phrase and of the origin of the -- of the introduction of notwithstanding, section 405 (b) into the Immigration and Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.798" offset="12326536">As I've indicated in section 3455, the savings clause was applicable only to the naturalization provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.148" offset="12359973">At that time, section 3455 had a provision at section 310 of Senate Bill 3455, which would -- which made petitions for naturalization, people who were eligible notwithstanding, their race or their marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.160" offset="12431966">And this language is in this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.288" offset="12444505">This section and I call this to Your Honors attention in order that the Court may note the difference between the specificity in this clause and the lack of specificity in section 241 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.002" offset="12495391">And the language says, and this appears in Senate Bill 3455, "This section shall apply to any person whose petition for naturalization shall hereafter be filed or shall have had been pending on the effective date of the Act."</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.268" offset="12560488">Now, in it -- in its analysis the Immigration and Naturalization Service has this to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.038" offset="12579506">The last section of section 310 of the bill will make section 310 applicable to petitions filed after the effective date of the bill, as well as those pending when the bill was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.862" offset="12626840">And this is what I call Your Honors attention to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.601" offset="12637811">In order to avoid any possible conflict with section 361 (b) of the bill, which was the savings clause, it is suggested that there be inserted at the beginning of line 5, page 160, of the phrase, "Notwithstanding, that section 361 (b)."</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.119" offset="12707819">That was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.159" offset="12711999">It was done in between Senate Bill 3455 and Senate Bill 716.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.632" offset="12737912">Now, as I previously observed, Senate Bill 716 had the savings clause applicable to the entire Act including the deportation provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.549" offset="12777618">That time, the -- the general counsel of the Immigration and Naturalization Service went over that bill with a fine-tooth comb and the general counsel made the very same suggestion with regard to 331 (d) of Senate Bill 716.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.385" offset="12840939">And at that -- and he said in order to avoid any -- the language of 331 (d) was identical with the language of section 310, and the general counsel of Immigration Service said, in order to avoid any conflict of the savings clause, it is suggested that on such and such line and page, immediately preceding a certain sentence, there'd be inserted the clause, "Notwithstanding the provisions of section 405 (b)."</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.801" offset="12938533">This, Your Honors, was at a time that the savings clause was made applicable to the deportation provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.689" offset="12962147">Congress complied with this suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.973" offset="12971238">And not only did it comply with that suggestion but it went through the entire Act when the savings clause was applicable to the entire Act and it added those magical passwords in all the sections where it now appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.561" offset="13025573">Now, we think it is anomalous More than that, we think it is an irony occasioned perhaps more about the desire to win the case than it is to be right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.812" offset="13058591">That the very author of those phrase, who thought they were necessary in a clause which is far less ambiguous than section 241 (d), should now say that they were not needed at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.396" offset="13108955">Now, besides the history, the legislative history and this footnote to the legislative history which I have cited, we feel that the language of the savings clause itself read together with the relevant provisions of 241 proved that nothing in 241 is an exception to the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.397" offset="13176978">The Government's approach to this issue, we feel, suffers because they regard the savings clause as a kind of barrel into which you put things and out of which you take things rather than looking at it as a series of separate and discrete concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.236" offset="13236328">Now, the first part of the savings clause states that nothing except in this Act, except as otherwise specifically provided, shall affect and a whole series of things are listed one of which, I shall note in passing, are acts done at the time that this Act shall take effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.705" offset="13302157">Now, one of the acts done would be as Mr. Justice Harlan has pointed out, an Act passed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.767" offset="13326399">And I don't believe that my Brother Fisher has answered Mr. Justice Harlan's question adequately because Congress is passing -- passes legislation all the time regarding aliens who have entered the United States illegally or who have entered here legally and has committed deportable offenses and they have said notwithstanding, those offenses, they shall be regarded as legal residents of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.498" offset="13413334">Now, that is an act done by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.863" offset="13422843">241 (d) would go behind that and say that notwithstanding, the fact that he entered the United States prior to the date of the Act, even though Congress may have passed the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.346" offset="13460773">Notwithstanding, he has committed the deportable offense, he shall be -- the provisions of section 241 making him deportable, shall apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.520" offset="13497448">So, there's one section in section 241 (d) which provides for a specific provision to affect a status, a condition or acts done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.613" offset="13537782">Now, the respondent Carson had such an act done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.144" offset="13547917">In 1945, the Attorney General terminated his immigration proceedings because by virtue of his conditional pardon by the Governor of Ohio, he was no longer deportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.267" offset="13592430">That act done, we believe, by operation of the savings clause, has continuing validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.129" offset="13615940">It says proceedings shall be continued to -- and in fact as otherwise provided the proceeding shall be continued to be valid.Now, the Chief Justice has indicated, it would matter not if this -- if a alien had been subjected to deportation proceedings which are pending when the Act was passed, but to say that those proceedings are legal or valid, but to say that the -- that the new law shall govern because those proceedings cannot be valid under the old law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.153" offset="13739969">The answer which my Brother Fisher has given to the Chief Justice question, I believe, vitiate the legality of the proceeding if it is to say that the person can be charged during dependency of a valid proceeding under the new law with a -- with a deportable offense under the new law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.388" offset="13808933">It calls to mind the reasons of Dallas case in which the attempt was made to put things under the -- in the savings clause which operated in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.505" offset="13845400">In the same sense, I believe that my Brother Fisher is trying to put a new deportation offense in the savings clause to operate a continuing and old deportation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.647" offset="13893987">But there's a -- an additional requirement in section 405 and we think it is significant because Congress must have thought it was significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.221" offset="13928260">When section 405 was first written and included in -- as a savings clause in as 361 (b) of the Senate Bill 3455, it had only one clause which read, "Except as otherwise specifically provided."</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.307" offset="14004642">But when it was put into title 4 of the savings clause and made applicable to the statute as a whole, it -- it added an additional "Except as otherwise provided clause."</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.486" offset="14053334">The first part of the sentence relates to declarations of intention, warrants of arrests, orders of deportation, statuses and so on; but as to all such prosecutions et cetera, the statutes or parts of statutes repealed by this Act are – and I emphasize -- unless otherwise specifically provided therein, hereby continued in force and effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.940" offset="14155107">Now, that second "except as otherwise specifically provided herein" did not appear in Senate Bill 3455.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.967" offset="14183215">It was not added to the bill until 716 when it was made applicable to the Act as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.992" offset="14207352">Now, we believe that this indication and intent by Congress to reinforce and to strengthen the continuation of the applicability of the old law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.144" offset="14243924">Otherwise, there would have been no reason to have added this additional specific provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.371" offset="14272867">Now, there two other provisions in the savings clause which pointed out, we believe, the absurdity and the error of the Government's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.466" offset="14305259">It has failed to observe that there are two dates, two conflicting dates here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.924" offset="14331068">The savings clause --</text>
