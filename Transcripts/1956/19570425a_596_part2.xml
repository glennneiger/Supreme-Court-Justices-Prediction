            <text syncTime="457.153" offset="1931995">That's the question which I've been a little bit concerned about when reading the Treasury Regulations which the Government refers to.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.580" offset="1969716">Two examples are given in those Treasury Regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.865" offset="1982882">One is a pinball game which refunds free plays and cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.571" offset="2005661">The second refers to what I believe we would call a one-armed bandit regardless of whether it pays out or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.180" offset="2044113">Now, I believe that that second example given in the Regulation is clearly erroneous because the statute itself says that the -- not only must the machine be a slot machine but it must require the insertion of a coin, the application of chance and the payout of money or property.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.795" offset="2118510">Therefore, I will argue that both those examples are erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.242" offset="2144319">And since the second one is clearly so, there's no reason why the -- the first one isn't equally so.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.760" offset="2178382">The -- now, to answer your question, whether a slot machine, which only paid out $2.20 cents would come outside the $250 hard tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="551.715" offset="2310248">And the fact that they pay out this infrequently, it doesn't mean that they're -- the chances are that much less, but merely that the people play off the games.</text>

            <text syncTime="635.179" offset="2644093">The language I think itself, but in addition to that, I think the legislative history is -- is fairly conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.979" offset="2683277">The original bill that was proposed provided for a single tax for $25 on two categories of machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.824" offset="2734686">And the two categories were set out as so-called pinball machines and so-called slot machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.135" offset="2763943">Then, after hearings were held, it was decided to differentiate the tax and put a $10 tax on pinball games and a $50 tax on slot machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.170" offset="2820054">And that was the way the statute was originally enacted with two categories, one relating to pinball games and one to slot machines with the two different taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.540" offset="2861537">And in 1942, when the tax was amended, what Congress did according to the language of the reports that were issued by the congressional committees who considered the matter was to broaden the $10 category to include other amusement devices such as music machines and gun games and other types of games that would be found in a -- what used to be called penny arcades.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.323" offset="2992671">Those reports by the congressional committee has indicated that -- and I'm quoting, “Under this amendment, there will be included in addition to pinball machines a great variety of other machines such as baseball and football games, machinegun games, music machine, so-called jukeboxes, and many other types.”</text>
            <text syncTime="739.553" offset="3061635">So that -- at that point, Congress was broadening that category to include other games but keeping pinball games in the $10 category which was mutually exclusive from the so-called slot machine category $250.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.977" offset="3127254">The Treasury Regulation which was adopted originally in 1942 as the Court of Appeals states, I think correctly that it is inconsistent with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.021" offset="3203427">In addition to that, the tax returns, which appear on pages 94 and 95 of the record, indicate that the Government up until 1952 and the 1952 date is a date, which was testified to by one of the Government's witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.737" offset="3294333">Up until 1952, the tax returns stated, “Coin-operated amusement devices, pinball and all other amusement or music machines $10 each and coin-operated gaming devices slot machines and all other machines, $100 each.”</text>
            <text syncTime="812.246" offset="3352325">That was before the change was made to $250.</text>

            <text syncTime="843.114" offset="3475832">Well, I -- I think that it can be said that when you read the -- the only thing you will have the opportunity to do is read the description of these games.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.929" offset="3511045">If you will see that they are typical pinball games that -- this isn't a special kind of a pinball game.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.520" offset="3533406">This is the kind of pinball game that everyone recognizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.543" offset="3545527">Now, if a person must have a -- a patent lawyer to determine whether a pinball game is one kind or another kind involving a, well, more of a patent lawyer or an engineer or someone who can determine at every point whether this involves an element or chance -- of chance or not, it would result in a, I would think a chaotic situation in regard to the proper enforcement of this tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="890.984" offset="3667257">Well, if it's in this two found tests though, it must involve not only an element of chance but also that it delivers or entitles the player to cash, a premium or something else.</text>

            <text syncTime="920.953" offset="3787212">I believe that's a case where Congress may say something in a general manner and if enough people say that they think there's a question as to whether their particular activity is covered or not, it's very possible that Congress will cover that specifically even though it's been covered generally in the statute itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="942.761" offset="3874461">Yes, but the 1-cent vending machine companies must have been afraid that they might come within slot machine, must they not, to ask special provision for themselves?</text>

            <label>Mr. John F. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="955.217" offset="3924198">Well, the -- at that time, the statute had recently been enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.114" offset="3943842">I suppose everyone was afraid that anything could happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.674" offset="3958053">But after 1942, it was another 13 or 14 years before -- apparently, there was any enforcement of this statute even against pinball games that pay off in money.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.865" offset="4014791">And I say that because not only it's the first time it has come to this Court, this issue, but also -- and the statute has been in effect since 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.210" offset="4052198">No Court of Appeals ever passed upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.915" offset="4058990">Yet, today, the Government says, “We have confiscated 500 machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.403" offset="4080933">We have 14,000 machines that are paying this tax,” because there are many people involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.895" offset="4102980">I submit that there would have been some adjudication to this issue before today if that statute had been enforced against pinball games that pay off money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.713" offset="4166196">Also, in the drive to -- the counsel says there's one inconsistent ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.185" offset="4196080">There are few others that tend to support this conclusion we reached on pages 89 and 90 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.415" offset="4244982">And also the Government hasn't produced any rulings which are contrary to the so-called inconsistent interpretation and I assume that there are any such rulings that they would have had accessed to them and produced them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.853" offset="4306735">In regard to the question about skill, and whether there is any skill or chance or whether one predominates over the other in any of these machines, I suppose we would all agree that you can't find the machine outside of one-armed bandit that doesn't have some element of chance and some element of skill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.882" offset="4426898">In this case, the Government witnesses testified this patron who was in the resort testified that she thought she was able to use a skill to determine the result to some extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.742" offset="4490324">The agent himself who came in and demanded the tax contended -- admitted on -- on cross-examination that by operating the plunger in a certain way by nudging the machine, it was possible to affect the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.651" offset="4565974">Even the manufacturer of a competing machine made that admission that there was skill involved in this particular machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.320" offset="4596694">Although, if you obviously would -- since he was a competitor, he would have the inclination to say otherwise that he possibly could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.448" offset="4725112">In my conclusion, I think that the statutory language may not be as clear as one side or the other would wish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.121" offset="4767848">I think it is clear enough to indicate and certainly more clearer in regard to supporting the interpretation placed upon that language by the Court of Appeals and on the opposite contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.998" offset="4815391">A legislative history supports that language and there's nothing in the -- outside of these two tests that should change the result to the Court of Appeals.</text>
