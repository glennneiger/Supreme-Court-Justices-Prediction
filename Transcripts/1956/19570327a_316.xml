            <text syncTime="61.071" offset="347617">In the Swanson case or may I -- at this point interrupt what I was going to say by answering Judge -- Justice Brennan's question directed to Mr. Doyle that in the event a -- the directors of a corporation said to a suing stockholder, there's no use of going on with this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.567" offset="445628">All we can do is try a lawsuit and if they were -- if we get a judgment, it will never be collected whether under said circumstances, the stockholder would be stating the kind of a cause of action that a court of equity or rather would -- would the situation be such as to warrant the alignment of the corporation as a defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="113.084" offset="555760">However, if the issue between the stockholder in that given situation and the corporation with this, the stockholder says, “I don't agree with you.</text>

            <text syncTime="126.739" offset="610304">Under those circumstances, there was a real disagreement between the stockholder and this corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.625" offset="633919">The corporation being definitely against the stockholder, it assumes an attitude deliberately against him.</text>

            <text syncTime="180.957" offset="827225">It's just a matter of disagreement between the directors and the stockholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.326" offset="840704">Is that enough to give the stockholder a right to supplant the directors in their judgment as to whether the suit should be brought?</text>

            <label>Mr. Herman H. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="189.226" offset="860244">No, Your Honor, but I assume that Mr. -- Mr. Justice Brennan's question assumed that the stockholder had alleged a series of facts which indicated wrongdoing upon the part of these individuals and the directors took this position and they said, “Yes, I guess you're right.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.331" offset="936730">These things are wrong but what's the use of going ahead with this thing?</text>
            <text syncTime="211.876" offset="950836">The corporation alone had spent a lot of money and on the line up, get a judgment against the man who has nothing and cannot collect.”</text>
            <text syncTime="219.296" offset="980511">Now, if the stockholder says, “Well, the disagreement between you and me is this, I disagree on -- on the basic premise that you have made.”</text>
            <text syncTime="231.335" offset="1028681">I say this man has a lot of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.005" offset="1039444">He's got it hidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.905" offset="1042996">He's got it concealed.</text>

            <text syncTime="238.708" offset="1058252">And under those conditions, I say that the -- that the -- we contend that the corporation should be aligned as a defendant because there is an adversity of interest to align such a corporation, to align such directors on the side of the plaintiff to ally them with the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.363" offset="1136828">It would create an incongruity of the worst order because in the first place, bare in mind that the directors have no controversy admittedly with these alleged wrongdoers, they say, “We have no controversy with them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="270.863" offset="1186774">Taking Mr. Justice Frankfurter's reasoning in the -- in the Indianapolis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.133" offset="1207881">Why -- how can you take a -- a directorate of a corporation that says, in so many words concededly and admittedly, “We have no quarrel with these defendants.”</text>
            <text syncTime="288.203" offset="1256155">We say that what they did was not only proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.513" offset="1269426">It was not only right.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.200" offset="1276217">It was just and the plaintiff hasn't got a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.490" offset="1289383">Furthermore, in this particular case, in the Warner matter, the defendant corporation joined in an answer with the alleged wrongdoers and it is conceded by counsel in that case that the directors believed that the conduct that the stockholder alleges was wrongful.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.751" offset="1386350">It was perfectly proper and just.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.331" offset="1396694">And they admit and the fact show that the corporation participated in this wrongful conduct because here, it was a contract made between a corporation, namely, Warner Brothers and Harry Warner's son-in-law.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.881" offset="1446849">Now, the corporate -- the stockholder comes along and says, “This was a -- a device and a vehicle by which the money was to be siphoned out of the corporation into the hands of the president's son-in-law.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.366" offset="1496795">Now, these things are not unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.576" offset="1505677">As I pointed out in my petition for certiorari in this Court, the -- the statistics on the -- on -- on the questions are really astounding.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.291" offset="1572551">Here is what the American Institute of Management says as late as May 14th, 1956, I'm quoting now from my petition for certiorari, Your Honors, on page 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.931" offset="1619048">They say, “Feather-betting occurs as top level management and extends down to the rank performance,” said AIM in the report to its 17,000 members.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.667" offset="1661994">And one of the biggest causes of feather-betting is nepotism.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.888" offset="1674951">Now, this is what this case is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.488" offset="1685295">Of course, nepotism, the -- the real connotation probably applies to things governmental, but in its latest connotation, that word has become -- has come to be applied to awkward situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.678" offset="1742033">In more than -- I -- I quote again in more than half of the 23,000 U.S. companies, AIM studied and executive and put his sons, cousins and brothers even an assortment of relatives on the payroll.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.580" offset="1793651">Now, this comes out of Time Magazine dated May 14th, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.190" offset="1816116">I have no reason to question the authority of the authoritativeness of this statement as a statistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.708" offset="1846209">Now, in listening to the arguments that have gone long in this -- in -- in the Swanson case, I -- I observed, if I may say so state, a -- a confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.555" offset="1905560">The question in my humble judgment as to whether diversity exists or does not exist in any case, it has been clearly stated by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the Indianapolis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.786" offset="1958536">And we have gone -- we have actually, in our brief applied the reasoning of Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the Indianapolis case to the present case and we have said in point two, I quote from page 22 of my brief, The Warner directorate is a validly on the defendant side of the matter in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.931" offset="2067101">It was error to realign the corporation as a -- as a complainant.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.551" offset="2085595">And using Mr. Justice Frankfurter's words in the Indianapolis case, I said that only if the expensive judicial integrity, judicial integrity, in quotes, may Warner be alive with the complainant in this case in face of directors' admissions which I test to say the least that they are not on the complainant side of the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.592" offset="2189772">In face of Warner counsels, that is the corporation counsels admission, that they are not antagonistic to the step.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.072" offset="2219656">They are antagonistic to the suit but the corporation is at one with the defendants in a common contention, namely, the challenge dealings in which if the corporation and these directors against whom we allege this wrongdoing, again, in a common contention, namely, to challenge dealings which -- in which it and they participate are unlawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="640.104" offset="2663737">Well, then may I -- may I state the facts briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.923" offset="2687039">Our client is a New York citizen and a stockholder of Warner Brothers Pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.914" offset="2706996">He commenced this action in the District Court in California back in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.184" offset="2744090">He commenced it against his corporation, the Warner Corporation, Harry and Jack Warner, the president and vice-president of the company, Harry Warner's son-in-law, Milton Sperling, and another corporation, namely, United, which was owned by the son-in-law.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.164" offset="2820054">Now, there would have been no question of diversity in this case who had it not been for the fact that Warner corporation, the stockholders company, is a Delaware corporation and the son-in-law's company happens to be a Delaware corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.094" offset="2875747">Now, having joined as defendants, the stockholders corporation, namely, Warner for short, and United, the son-in-law's corporation, if there -- if the corporation is realigned, that is the stockholders corporation is realigned on the side of the plaintiff, obviously, diversity is lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.165" offset="2955995">Having done so, the defendants put in an answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.916" offset="2975013">Now, the -- by the defendants, I mean the corporation, Warner, Harry and Jack Warner, they all appeared by the same attorneys and joined in a common answer in which they denied, (1), that the plaintiff was a citizen of New York, (2), they denied all of the allegations of alleged wrongdoing and breach of trust that the complainant had alleged in this complaint, namely, the making of a series of contracts and the dealings between the Warner corporation and the son-in-law's corporation which the gist of which was that there was over reaching and self-dealing, bringing about an unwarranted and unjust enrichment in favor of the son-in-law and to the detriment of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.567" offset="3181589">Now, of course, this unjust enrichment didn't stop merely with the making of a contract or with the signing of a contract or with the dealings of the parties over a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.423" offset="3221086">And incidentally, while this action was pending, amendments were made to this -- this contract and this joint venture between the Warner corporation and the son-in-law's corporation was not only continued but was increased in scope from time to time, more and more pictures were added which the son-in-law's corporation was to produce and on which he was to get 50% of the profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.243" offset="3320351">Now, the -- the basic claim of the stockholder here is that something was given away to the son-in-law by a doting father-in-law.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.514" offset="3353475">Now, that's the summon substance of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.966" offset="3367267">Having taken the position, when -- when I say having taken the position, I mean by the corporation that this was perfectly good and advantageous to the company, they were going to make a lot of money and this was -- this was good business to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.703" offset="3438216">The plaintiff went on to discovery and for a long period of time, there were -- there was a lot of discovery, admissions, request for admissions and depositions and interrogatories to this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.715" offset="3490252">Finally, we came down to pretrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.134" offset="3515956">There was no suggestion in the answer or there was no suggestion up to this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.094" offset="3531734">Now, this pretrial happens some two or three years after the action have been commenced or maybe four.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.524" offset="3553468">There was no suggestion up to that time that there was a lack of diversity here.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.284" offset="3572485">Judge Mathes at pretrial questioned counsel with respect to that and sua sponte raised the question which he was entitled to do and as the -- this Court has held that this Court can do it all when -- when it gets here.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.270" offset="3636433">In other words, if there was no jurisdiction, there was no jurisdiction no matter how long the case had gone on and no matter when it was raised or no matter how somnolent and sleepy everybody was on the question up to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.029" offset="3691499">Having raised that question as the findings show in this case, the judge made an order practically as follows and I -- I stated in my brief this way, the merits of the controversy, namely, whether the Warner-United dealings are in fact unlawful and should be terminated and whether United -- Warner-United contract should be ordered canceled to the extent that they remain unexecuted or not reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.809" offset="3806647">The Court ordered two issues to be tried, namely, one, jurisdiction, and two, the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.409" offset="3832978">He said, he should be inquired into preliminarily before we go ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.380" offset="3848861">Let's see whether this Court has jurisdiction before we go on and rightfully so.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.780" offset="3870490">The parties were directed to present evidence and I have this in quotes and emphasize only as to those issues and the findings go on to say, “Thereupon, evidence on behalf of plaintiff and defendants, it was offered and received and the cause argued and submitted on the two above stated issues only.”</text>
            <text syncTime="962.873" offset="3954813">So then, it is clear from this finding that Judge Mathes was concerned primarily and only as it turned out to be with the question of diversity jurisdiction and even the question of the statute of limitations although considerable evidence was introduced on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.263" offset="4020433">It was not reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.933" offset="4027120">Judge Mathes held as follows and this is in concurred distinction to the holding in the Swanson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.733" offset="4058258">And may I briefly summarize what I believe the holding in the Swanson case is before ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.853" offset="4078738">The holding in the Swanson case is that in the absence of a showing, that the law -- that the directorate was hostile to the prosecution of the suit, the corporation should not be aligned as a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.765" offset="4130461">Now, that's the summon substance of the holding in the Swanson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.475" offset="4145298">The holding in our case, however, in the -- in the Sperling case, it goes beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.125" offset="4171839">The Court says, “That isn't enough.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.985" offset="4179362">The holding here is that neither a showing that the directorate is hostile to the prosecution of the suit nor a showing that the directorate is antagonistic to the objects of the suit is sufficient to warrant the corporation's alignment as a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.525" offset="4249475">Nothing short of preponderating proof that the corporation was actually dominated and controlled by the co-defendants can save the corporation from being realigned as a plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.550" offset="4309556">Now, we say that that is not the law and has never been the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.860" offset="4334843">Neither Doctor against Harrington has held that, nor has Venner against the Great Northern held that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.561" offset="4361592">And while I'm on that subject, may I -- may I say what --</text>

            <text syncTime="1070.925" offset="4387088">Does that mean, do you read that as saying that it's not enough to show that however corrupt maybe the board of directors and however corrupt their motivation not to bring the action, the stockholder has actually to show that the corporation itself is a captive of the defendants not connected with the corporation?</text>

            <text syncTime="1092.055" offset="4471620">No, Your Honor, I -- I -- no, I -- I think what Judge Mathes said virtually was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.925" offset="4499101">He says, the stockholder is incumbent upon the stockholder and it's a prerequisite to -- as right to be heard in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.585" offset="4533687">It is incumbent upon a stockholder to show that the directorate that each and every member of that board of directors was actually dominated and controlled in this case by the president and vice-president that he controlled them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.780" offset="4594500">And that they were simply, as Mr. Justice Douglas in his article in the directors who do not direct practically, I think called them directorial gigolos or something to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.095" offset="4655731">That's about the size of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.305" offset="4660642">That is the holding of Judge Mathes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.075" offset="4671718">You have to go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.410" offset="4677047">And in my petition for certiorari, Your Honor, I have -- and I refer to page 13, I have made this remark with respect to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.400" offset="4716962">Admissions like the foregoing and I -- in a moment state what these admissions were, admissions like the foregoing will fall short of proof by preponderance of the evidence that the directory was dominated and controlled by the alleged wrongdoers because as appellees successfully contended in the court below, men who posses personal strength and integrity cannot be controlled by such venal considerations or substantial annual salaries from the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.531" offset="4841514">In short, the decision of the courts below in essence is -- or in essence required the stockholder to demonstrate to an almost mathematical certainty that the ethical current in each of his company's directors is not adequate to overcome, prompt this himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.247" offset="4920404">And I went on to say a virtually impossible task and a task which with deference to the courts below seems decidedly out of harmony with this Court's recent observations, and I refer to Mr. Justice Reeds' observation in Koster against Lumbermens in which he said it has been the whole course of our law to break down the barriers against calling corporations to account in all States where they're maybe doing business and Mr. Justice Black's observation in that same case as follows, namely, the whole trend of recent congressional legislation has been to protect corporate stock and security holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.752" offset="5062405">See for example, Securities Act of 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.822" offset="5074631">But this legislation was not intended as a complete substitute for the antidote by stockholder suits for the dangers inherent in the modern development of frequent conflicts between corporate owners and corporate managers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.677" offset="5134085">Now, the factual background upon which we make all of these statements, Your Honors, is briefly stated in our statement beginning on page 6 and going on for three or four pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.650" offset="5230007">The inquiry that the Court had ordered into jurisdiction in this case unfolded, as we say the following realities, that one of us owned by the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.911" offset="5270967">Its stock was distributed among some 30,000 stockholders.</text>

            <text syncTime="2798.524" offset="11297520">Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.598" offset="11321762">It has been well pointed out by Judge -- more and more of the justices that they should first find out what the facts are in determining that framework, what rule of law is after.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.362" offset="11400861">We suggest most definitely that the facts are those which are found by Judge Mathes after a full scale trial lasting 15 days, consuming 2000 pages of transcript and many hundreds of dozens of exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.537" offset="11497514">On the single question or the double question of the jurisdiction of the United States District Courts to entertain the action and the questions of whether the statute of limitations was a bar to the taking of the action and the fact that those two issues were coupled is logical because the issue of realignment and diversity jurisdictions depended on the question of whether the corporation was in hands hostile to its interest or whether it was dominated by the wrongdoers or otherwise unable to protect itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.411" offset="11668982">And also basically, the question of statute of limitations depended upon a finding of fact covering the same subject matter because if the corporation had been unable to protect its own interests, the statute of limitations would not have been running against the action, whereas if it were able to protect his own interest, it would have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.109" offset="11751842">However, in view of Judge Mathes' decision with reference to the -- to the basic question of diversity of jurisdiction, he never came to the point and obviously, he could not come to the point of deciding the -- the second question of statute of limitations because he had no jurisdiction to decide anything except that he had no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.707" offset="11846196">I may say, if the Court please, that frankly we were a little disappointed at the judges decision realizing the sincerity of his approach and the meticulous regard which Judge Mathes had for the limits of federal jurisdiction, a -- a regard which is probably unusual and probably accounts for the fact that there hasn't been, so far as I know, another case just like this where so much evidence has been taken where the real issues have really been decided because I suspect in many cases where judges who had less regard for the limits of federal jurisdiction, they may have gone ahead and decided the cases on the merits in favor of the defendants, they never came up on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.695" offset="12070118">But Judge Mathes did have that regard and as you're -- this Court will find when the examination of his very scholarly opinion, he -- he had a great deal of thought and -- and sincere work to the solution of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.225" offset="12132289">However, with all this background of evidence, he made findings of facts which appears to me it would be utterly decisive of this case in view of our understanding of the meaning and effect of Doctor against Harrington and Venner against Great Northern and -- and Koster against Lumbermens Mutual and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.554" offset="12233540">He found this, and I think it's worth reading these findings in full because they're not too long and yet, they are the very crux of this case, that the Board of Directors of Warner Brothers Pictures, Inc. is composed of 11 men of whom the defendants, Harry M. Warner and Jack L.Warner and their brother Albert Warner, not a defendant, but three, that the contract in controversy was made and entered into in good faith and without fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.794" offset="12350568">And said contract was intended by the directors to be of financial benefit to Warner Brothers Pictures, Inc. and its stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.189" offset="12388080">And said contract was considered by said 11 members of the Board of Directors of Warner Brothers Pictures, Inc. to be a sound business arrangement for the best interest and future interests of the -- for the best present and future interests of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.975" offset="12459238">That in approving and authorizing the contract, the officers and board of directors acted in good faith and exercised their independent business judgment that at time of the execution of the contract, Albert Warner, together with the defendants Harry M. Warner and Jack L. Warner, owned less than 20% of the outstanding shares of stock of Warner Brothers Pictures, Inc. and that neither the corporation nor the directors or officers were shown to be at that time or at any time under the domination or control of the three brothers Warner above name that neither the stockholders, its officers or directors were at any time involved in this action antagonistic to the financial interest of the corporation that it is not true either as alleged in the complaint or otherwise that all or a majority or any of the board of directors and officers of Warner Brothers Pictures, Inc. wrongfully participated in the acts in the complaint complained of, nor was said board of directors dominated or controlled by Harry M. Warner, Jack L. Warner and Albert l. Warner, Milton Sperling or anyone or more of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.097" offset="12763721">It is not true that if demand had been made upon Warner Brothers Pictures, Inc. that those to whom such application would be made to institute said act said suit would have been disqualified from faithfully doing their duty as directors and officers of said corporation because of any matters or facts set forth in said complaint or otherwise that no demand was made under directors of Warner Brothers Pictures Incorporated to institute this suit and such demand would have been futile, nor was any demand addressed to the stockholders of said corporation that the stockholders of said corporation --</text>
