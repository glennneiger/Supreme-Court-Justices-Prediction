            <label>Mr. Warren M. Christopher</label>
            <text syncTime="18.496" offset="73979">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.120" offset="88398">This case is here on appeal from the Superior Court of the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.203" offset="108774">The appeal raises questions concerning the validity of appellant's conviction for violation of a Los Angeles ordinance relating to the registration of convicted persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.960" offset="151824">The ordinance in issue makes a crime for a person to be or remain in the City of Los Angeles for more than five days without registering with the Chief of Police.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.559" offset="198217">In the course of the registration process, the convicted person will be required to give personal information about himself in 10 different categories and he will also be photographed and fingerprinted.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.604" offset="254328">“A convicted person” that term is defined in the ordinance in a most comprehensive manner to include anyone who has been convicted any place in the world since 1921 of a crime punishable in California as a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.838" offset="327262">The crime created by the ordinance is punishable both by a fine and by imprisonment, and each day's violation is a separate offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.561" offset="370207">The appellant here was arrested and charged with a violation of this ordinance in February of 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.091" offset="400300">The evidence at her trial in a Los Angeles Municipal Court showed that she had been convicted in 1951 of the crime of forgery which is an offense punishable in California as a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.834" offset="455262">The evidence further showed that appellant had not registered with the Chief of Police at the time of her arrest and that she was a resident of Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.768" offset="494968">At her trial, appellant sought to show that she did not know of the existence of this ordinance but the Court excluded that testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.072" offset="532271">The jury found the appellant guilty as charged and the Court imposed sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.956" offset="555781">A felon's conviction was appealed to the Superior Court for Los Angeles County but that Court affirmed in a brief opinion stating that there was no merit to the claim that the ordinance was unconstitutional and that it is no defense that appellant did not know of the registration requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.151" offset="628506">That decision was the pronouncement of the highest California court to which an appeal could be taken in this case and therefore, an appeal was taken to this Court, the Supreme Court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.664" offset="674586">The case was argued here last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.086" offset="684304">And near the end of the term, it was set down for reargument.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.526" offset="698096">I appear here today as amicus curiae for the appellant at the invitation of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.411" offset="737593">In the discussion here today, I hope to be able to emphasize three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.982" offset="755879">First, that the effect of the ordinance is to invade the constitutionally protected rights of the appellant and other convicted persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.353" offset="793391">Second, that the ordinance is not reasonably restricted to the evil with which it purports to deal, that is to say that it's unconstitutionally brought an arbitrary in its scope and coverage and third, that appellant's conviction in the absence of wrongful intent amounts to a deprivation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.030" offset="876042">Turning first to consider the effect of the ordinance on a convicted person's right, I would point out that the ordinance erodes a convicted person's right to privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.477" offset="925884">At the time of registration, the convicted person is required to reveal a great deal of personal information as well as his past criminal record.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.955" offset="967784">All of this registration data including his photograph and fingerprints may be transmitted to other law enforcement agencies.More significantly, his photograph will be put in a gallery where it may be exhibited to members of the public and beyond that, police officers are currently free to disclose this information so long as they do so in the regular course of their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.988" offset="1079902">This invasion of privacy, it seems to me, it's a convicted person where it may hurt him the most.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="276.493" offset="1105920">Mr. Christopher, you talked as though the right of privacy is in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.137" offset="1120444">I think the phrase derived from the -- unless I'm wrong, you can correct me, but I think the phrase was used by Justice Brandeis where it had pertinence, namely, his objection to an unreasonable search and seizure but if every interference with what one doesn't like because of the right of privacy can be found the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.796" offset="1195154">I'm not saying -- I'm not saying, I'm not even sympathetically.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="302.424" offset="1209678">But I -- I am always troubled when I hear these phrases that I don't find in the Constitution as though they were in it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Warren M. Christopher</label>
            <text syncTime="307.700" offset="1230785">It seems to me that the right to privacy is synthesis of a number of different constitutional provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.736" offset="1250847">Certainly, part of it derives from the First Amendment, part from the Fourth as you indicate and part from the Fifth and part from the term “liberty” in the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="321.708" offset="1286792">Maybe it's a narrow mindedness on my part (Inaudible) to have you prove it violates the First Amendment rather than making a sympathy before you prove that it does.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_m_christopher" startTime="330.427" stopTime="437.173">
            <label>Mr. Warren M. Christopher</label>
            <text syncTime="330.427" offset="1321691">Only last term in the Watkins case, of course, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, the Court referred to the right to privacy as if it were a constitutionally protected right.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.369" offset="1365473">Disclosure of an ex-convict past record, even the reminder of it that's involved in registration may undo even the most conscientious efforts on his part to reform.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.300" offset="1409149">This is especially true of a convicted person is attempting to start a new life in a new community.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.034" offset="1432033">If the registration data about his past reaches his new neighbors or his new friends, even worse, his new employer, he may well conclude that he really can't live down his past mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.221" offset="1484800">Experts in the field of penology, such as Mr. Bennett, the Director of Federal Prisons, emphasized that nothing is more likely to interfere with a convicted person's rehabilitation than of the disclosure of the fact that he has once been a prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.031" offset="1548121">The convicted person's right to liberty is also curtailed by the Los Angeles ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.828" offset="1571213">In addition to the physical burdens of the registration process, the fact of registration may subject the convicted person to detention and questioning in police roundups.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.919" offset="1627638">And beyond that, I don't want to point out that the ordinance limits a convicted person's right to move freely among the States, his right to live and work where he will.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.448" offset="1665776">In the face of the ordinance, the convicted person must recognize that he can go to Los Angeles only if he is willing to register with the Chief of Police and to reregister every time he changes his address.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.998" offset="1715931">The net effect of this is to put a burden on the right of free transit which is one of the privileges and immunities guaranteed by the Constitution.</text>

            <label>Mr. Warren M. Christopher</label>
            <text syncTime="553.307" offset="2213198">Well, I'm arguing basically three points here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.239" offset="2228872">First, that there are constitutionally protected rights that are invaded here, invaded so significantly that the little value that the ordinance served does not justify the invasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.781" offset="2267115">Second, I say that even though some of these ordinances might be valid, this one is so broadly drawn that it's not reasonably restricted to the evil at which it aimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.907" offset="2307553">And third, I am saying that this conviction is invalid because there was no proof that the defendant here had any wrongful intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.282" offset="2345064">Indeed, I was about to say that the justification for these ordinances as a whole is that the persons to whom they apply are convicted persons, that is that they have been sometime in their life convicted of a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.749" offset="2398981">Now, I've argued in detail in my brief that this innocent and passive status, a status of just having once sometime in your life been convicted is not a proper basis for the deprivation of constitutional rights anymore than the status of being an indigent or the status of being a member of a particular race would justify the invasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.344" offset="2485290">It seems fair to me that the ordinance is unconstitutional on that ground that I refer you to my brief on that point because it seems to me, that there are narrower grounds for the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.127" offset="2532415">One of the narrower grounds of the Los Angeles ordinance is not reasonably restricted to the evil with which it purports to deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.197" offset="2564702">The acknowledged purpose of these ordinances is to maintain surveillance of professional criminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.740" offset="2590929">As the city says, the ordinance is directed at the evil of professionalism and crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.826" offset="2615275">Now, despite that limited purpose, the ordinance itself is completely undiscriminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.244" offset="2636904">It applies to everyone who had been convicted at any place in the United States since 1921 of a crime punishable in California as a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.447" offset="2681731">The arbitrary broadness of this ordinance can be seen fairly from the fact that it applies to first offenders and probationers.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.802" offset="2715167">The statistics in my brief emphatically show that the great majority of first offenders and probationers lead law-abiding lives after their conviction and that only a small fraction of them ever get into trouble with the law again.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.923" offset="2775667">As to probationers, a careful study indicates that 98% of an approved sampling were free from subsequent convictions of felonies and that 84% had no convictions at all, either misdemeanors or felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.321" offset="2833241">The figures on first offenders are even more convincing.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.459" offset="2845780">Only about 7% of the first offenders in the group of probationers who were studied were subsequently convicted of any offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.365" offset="2885381">These figures mean that in order to maintain surveillance of the few first offenders in probationers who will commit another offense, the constitutional rights of the great majority will have been invaded for no reason at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.814" offset="2939193">In terms of numbers, to maintain surveillance of about 10 men out of 100 who may commit another crime, the constitutional rights of about 90 men who will never commit another crime, will have been invaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.337" offset="3001260">In contrast to the first offender, the multiple offender is very likely to revert the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.777" offset="3027069">Depending on the number of his prior arrest, the percentage of multiple offenders who will return the crime ranges between 20% to 50% or even higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.008" offset="3068029">It is this group of professional or habitual criminals that the ordinance is directed at.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.676" offset="3090704">To infringe the constitutional rights of all convicted persons to maintain surveillance as these professional criminals, it seems to me, to be clearly arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.361" offset="3133440">The brief for the Attorney General of California states that a relatively high percentage of persons admitted to -- to prison have prior criminal records.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.998" offset="3171892">The fallacy in those figures is that the prison population is a much different group statistically than the group of convicted persons and even more different than the group of first offenders and probationers.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.449" offset="3229780">The prison population is largely made up of multiple offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.884" offset="3247438">Most first offenders simply do not go to prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.609" offset="3266351">Thus, the Attorney General's statistics tell us almost nothing at all about first offenders and probationers, tell us almost nothing about whether they will revert to crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.145" offset="3304490">All those statistics of prison population show is that judges don't very often sentence first offenders imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.366" offset="3349420">I would point out that the ordinance also seems arbitrary in its scope and coverage and then it gives no weight to time elapsed since conviction as long as the person had been convicted since 1921 is required to register even if he has been a law-abiding citizen for as long as 35 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.563" offset="3438237">Such an ordinance, it seems to me, is not only at war with our widely held belief and rehabilitation but it also ignores the available evidence which indicates the time elapsed since conviction is a most important factor in determining the likelihood of repetition.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.476" offset="3509812">If there is a significant period of lawful behavior after conviction, the likelihood of repetition is almost new.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.804" offset="3539174">For instance, a study of federal payrollees indicates that only 4% of those who violate parole do so more than two years after their release.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.080" offset="3596225">Appellee's suggestion that a probationer may avoid the arguments by having his conviction set aside under a section of the California Penal Code, seems to me, to be entirely shallow.Our research indicates that this statute is unique to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.236" offset="3664875">It clearly would not be applicable to probationers coming to California from another State.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.643" offset="3698521">In light of this sweeping and undiscriminating coverage, it seems patent to me that the Los Angeles ordinance is not reasonably restricted to the evil with which it purports to deal that are disarbitrary and discriminatory and that therefore offends due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.503" offset="3765917">I believe the situation here is closely analogous to Butler against Michigan last term where the Court invalidated the Michigan obscenity statute on the ground that it was not reasonably restricted to the evil with which it purported to deal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1284.594" offset="5138286">As I was beginning to say, it seems to me that there is an additional defect here and that appellant was convicted without any proof that she had any wrongful intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.202" offset="5172767">Indeed, the court below held the proof -- proof of wrongful intent was unnecessary and that appellant's lack of knowledge of the existence of this ordinance and for duty to register was no defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.613" offset="5218429">It is my contention here that in the circumstances of this case, due process required proof of wrongful intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.856" offset="5247373">Required proof, that is that appellant either knew or should have known of a duty to register and wrongfully ignored it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.258" offset="5281019">Circumstances to which I refer are these, first, appellant status as a convicted person was morally innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.409" offset="5317590">It simply had no ethical significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.781" offset="5327099">It didn't give her that warning of wrongdoing that we usually associate with crimes of violence and crimes where harm is done to someone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.200" offset="5360744">Beyond that, her status was entirely passive and thus, unlike a person who is engaged in some kind of active conduct, she had no reason for inquiring about the existence of possible regulatory statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.213" offset="5412780">Furthermore, there was no proof at the trial whether appellant either knew or should have known of the existence of the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.858" offset="5443396">It is those circumstances coupled with the fact that this ordinance is punishable by imprisonment as well as by a fine that leads me to urge that conviction here in the absence of wrongful intent violates due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1486.015" offset="5944007">In the Morissette case in connection with the intent point, this Court recently canvassed the necessity for wrongful intent as an element of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.586" offset="5978279">In that opinion, the Court pointed out that the elimination of wrongful intent has been approved and only a limited class of offenses, the so-called public welfare offenses and only reluctantly there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.035" offset="6028121">Although, of course, the Morissette was a statutory case, not a constitutional case, the extents of historical material set forth in that case make it clear that except -- with respect to the public welfare offenses, the requirement of wrongful intent is so deeply rooted in our traditions and so deeply in the conscience of our people that it is to be ranked as fundamental, a part of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.378" offset="6145463">When we consider the nature of the crime created by the Los Angeles ordinance, it seems plainly not to fall within the category of public welfare offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.155" offset="6184542">Public welfare offenses pertain to matters such as traffic and motor vehicle, intoxicating liquors and misbranded foods and drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.631" offset="6218501">Persons convicted of violating statutes pertaining to such matters are engaged in active, not passive conduct and they either know or should know that their conduct is likely to be subject to regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.449" offset="6269701">Moreover, most of the public welfare offenses are punishable only by a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.125" offset="6292480">In contrast, to go back over the effect of the Los Angeles ordinance, it makes a crime out of a status which is entirely passive and morally innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.682" offset="6330723">The crime is punishable not only by a fine, but as I have said to Mr. Justice Black, also by imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.358" offset="6357368">In this situation, there is no reason and no justification, as we see it, for approving the elimination of intent as an element of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.781" offset="6395089">The Attorney General has pointed out that this Court has upheld convictions in the absence of wrongful intent in the Balint case in 258 U.S. and in the Dotterweich case in 320 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.918" offset="6447647">There is only time for me to say about these cases that these are classic public welfare offenses, narcotics, food and drugs were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.888" offset="6479517">And that in both cases, the defendant knew or should have known that his conduct was subject to regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.633" offset="6510446">To hold the wrongful intent is required under the Los Angeles ordinance will not result in any drastic change in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.349" offset="6541375">I'm not suggesting that wrongful intent is the required element of every crime, what I do contend is that where an ordinance make say morally innocent and passive status, a crime punishable by imprisonment, a person's conviction should be upheld only if it is proved that he knew or should have known of the existence of the requirement and wrongfully ignored him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.572" offset="6634266">In practice, this would mean that the Los Angeles police, when they arrested a person who did not know of -- of the ordinance would have to give him a chance to register before charging him with a violation of the ordinance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1758.535" offset="7034044">After attempt to add through the arguments of able amicus curiae, first of all, our position is that criminal registration is inherently a denial of due process and of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.086" offset="7108336">First of all, aside from the limited adoption which have been pointed by amicus curiae and the fact that over the rest of the civilized western world is almost unheard-of, though they have similar social problems, similar criminal problem nowhere except in the United States and only here in -- in (Inaudible) recent period of time do we have such an ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.091" offset="7204362">Los Angeles made the way in 1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.665" offset="7214602">It is -- but I think limitedly adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.432" offset="7225678">Many of the major cities have not adopted it and in fact majority of these have not adopted it, only about 17% having done so up to this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.378" offset="7265489">There is no showing that it has any effect in deterring the crime rate, but there is certainly, a showing both by this case and case of which the Court might take judicial notice, and I'll go in that a minute, that there have been an increase in police harassment of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.898" offset="7339572">On the first place, everyone of the counsel here involved, either for appellee or appellant or as amicus curiae has asked the Court in effect to look into the surrounding circumstances as presented by our various briefs and I think that is an appeal for the Court to take judicial notice of the -- the setting in which this statute arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.041" offset="7420134">And from that standpoint, I -- I asked -- I have incorporated in my brief the article, the able article of University of Pennsylvania which is the best single treatment of this problem and as the Court considered along with the other circumstances presented in the brief of the other party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.993" offset="7483873">And certainly, under that treatment, it clearly appears that there has not been a decrease in crime rate, there has been an increase in police harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.920" offset="7531624">I submit that this was panic along this legislation which has no real basis and fact as pointed out by the article which I mentioned almost in -- in deductive portion thereof that -- that there was not in fact any increase in crime in the 1930s, only an increase alarm about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.170" offset="7604663">And it certainly has not does decrease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.996" offset="7611977">It says the adoption of this ordinance anywhere, where it has been adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.830" offset="7639249">On the other hand, this ordinance inherently encourages police violation of privacy and false arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.286" offset="7673104">Now, I submit that the reason behind this ordinance have to do with facilitating effectivity of -- of a sort which we don't really look upon the favor, namely, police discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.416" offset="7733603">One other instance in which this had been prominent, as may have the American Law Institute in its Model Penal Code and the comments thereto, to strongly recommend that moral offenses particularly in the realm of sex be eliminate as criminal acts where voluntary acts of -- concerning portable party because one reason is given among others is that in this field, police harassment has been the rule and that it has inherently a prejudicial thing to the rights of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.895" offset="7847497">I submit that this particular category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.922" offset="7855647">We do not face with false in the same general classification of -- of statutes which just amend themselves in its very nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.473" offset="7885845">And I -- I think that it was in the mind of those who organized and planned this particular thing, to put a weapon in the hands of police, to discriminate against criminals that they did not like.</text>

            <text syncTime="3523.874" offset="14095464">Thereafter, the verdict of the jury was returned, finding the appellant guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.752" offset="14118975">A motion for a new trial was made out also in motion in arrest of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.643" offset="14134544">At that time, appellant again raised the constitutional issues in a very general classification, and for the first time, offered to prove certain things which would go into the nature of a false arrest.</text>
