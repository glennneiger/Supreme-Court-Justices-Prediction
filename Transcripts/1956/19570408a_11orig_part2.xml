          <heading>Argument of W. Scott Wilkinson</heading>
          <turn speaker="w_scott_wilkinson" startTime="0.000" stopTime="113.405">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Wilkinson</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.425" offset="133099">The Attorney General of Louisiana made an opening statement to outline briefly the points on which Louisiana relies in this case, leaving to me the matter of making the main argument and answering the questions that the Court may have propound in that connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.042" offset="215542">I would like to take up where the United States Attorney General left off which will permit me more or less to go chronologically into the argument of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.855" offset="278758">That is, I would like to start on the proposition that, at the time of or prior to the time that Louisiana entered into the Union, its boundaries were three leagues or more from its coast in the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.537" offset="349497">In that connection, let me comment, first, upon the letter of the Secretary of State which the Solicitor General says is conclusive on the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.325" offset="404668">To me, that is an unheard of proposition that a plaintiff from the case may bring his suit before Court to ask a Court to adjudicate on the location of certain boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.848" offset="466735">Then, after the answer of the defendant is filed, to write to another official of the Government and ask that official of the Government to state where those boundaries are, and to present that reply to this Court and to say that that decides the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.542" offset="529533">It isn't necessary to have this Court if that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.833" offset="550745">That is not so.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="113.405" stopTime="119.010">
            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="113.405" offset="557014">Well, do you mean if we accepted what he said that would decide the case against him?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_scott_wilkinson" startTime="119.010" stopTime="335.027">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Wilkinson</label>
            <text syncTime="119.010" offset="579375">If Mr. -- I wouldn't say even that because I'm going into Mr. Dulles' letter in just a minute to read a part of it that the Solicitor General did not read to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.695" offset="622111">I know he didn't leave that out intentionally because neither of us have time to go into everything we might choose to say to Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.816" offset="654608">It would take too much time to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.310" offset="668609">First, I do want to say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.530" offset="681462">Opposing counsel referred to the political branches of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.808" offset="698598">He continued to refer to the political branches of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.164" offset="712077">There's not just one, they are two the Legislative Branch and the Executive Branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.766" offset="734438">There's never been a treaty entered into by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.580" offset="749693">It was not negotiated by the Executive Department and concurred in by a two-thirds vote of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.422" offset="777070">Those are the political branches of the Government, and this case has specifically said so that our foreign relations -- in the (Inaudible) case that's quoted in our brief that the foreign relations of this nation are vested in the political departments of the Government - the Legislative and the Executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.333" offset="880724">And, it would be, indeed, a noble situation if either one of these two had the sole right to interpret the meaning of a treaty or a meaning of an Act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.223" offset="936312">That is a judicial matter for this Court to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.228" offset="952299">It is true that there have been cases where the position of the United States and International Affairs has been declared to be thus and so by the Executive Department of the Government, such as where the boundary between the United States and Spain may have been at a certain time, and the Court has refused to go behind that statement and on this theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.509" offset="1061386">That for the -- for the Executive Department of the Government to say to a foreign nation “our boundary is here,” and then this Court to come and say that it isn't there, there could be no stability in our Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.262" offset="1116453">But, in matters relating between the United States and a state, and this Court so said that in an early case of United States versus Texas which we cite in our brief here, in matters of determining boundaries as between the United States and a state or as between the states of the Union, those are matters to be determined by the judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.286" offset="1212479">And, to close this part of my argument as quickly as I may, I would simply like to read this short statement made by this Court in the case of In re Cooper, reported on 143 US 472, also cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.565" offset="1281651">Without the clear -- this is what this Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.086" offset="1291682">“Without the clear authority of the law of commerce, the Executive can never, by determining a so-called political question or by construing an Act of Congress or a treaty, conclude the rights of persons or property under the protection of the Constitution and laws of the United States in a determination of these rights.”</text>
            <text syncTime="320.186" offset="1384155">And, that is exactly the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.518" offset="1397426">You're asked to determine the rights of the State of Louisiana on the say so of the Executive Department of the Government and without reference to what Congress may have said.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="355.362" offset="1524799">Therefore, matters of declarations by the Secretary of State, passed the international policy of the Government which, for me, doesn't foreclose the questions in this case at all.</text>

            <label>Mr. W. Scott Wilkinson</label>

          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="371.115" stopTime="401.517">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="371.115" offset="1587806">Now, if that -- if that's foreclosed, whether or not, international law, whether that's the their meaning, that the Government of the United States, according to the Secretary of State, speaks with authority and conclusively on that point, that the Government of the United States had, from the day it sent this down, maintained that its attitude and intonations with other nation what right it claims on the seas.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_scott_wilkinson" startTime="401.517" stopTime="557.342">
            <label>Mr. W. Scott Wilkinson</label>
            <text syncTime="401.517" offset="1709432">I don't think it's maintained that attitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.498" offset="1721344">Reading Secretary Dulles' letter here, we find that Thomas Jefferson made his statement in 1793.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.885" offset="1758960">That is quoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.676" offset="1762095">Then, he skips over to 1868 where he quotes a statement from Secretary of State Seward.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.356" offset="1792815">What Jefferson did say in 1793 under the pressure of a war between European nations when America was a weak nation that had just achieved its independence was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.067" offset="1843597">The greatest distance to which any respectable assent among nations had been at any time given has been the extent of the human sight estimated at upward of 20 miles and the smallest distance, I believe, claimed by any nation, or whatever, is a range of cannonball usually stated at one sea league.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.343" offset="1932727">Some intermediate distances also have been insisted on and that of three sea leagues has some authority in its favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.290" offset="1972537">Now, here's what he goes on to say with reference to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.304" offset="1984554">The character of our coast, remarkable and considerable parts of it -- and certainly remarkable in that part that deals with the State of Louisiana where the coastline has measured 467 miles along the line between seaward waters in the open sea and 7793 miles when you follow all the sinuosities of the coast and the islands and the bays and the inlets and such, the character of our coast remarkable and considerable parts of it were admitting no vessels of size to pass near the shores would entitle us in reason to as broad marginal protected navigation as any nation, whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.188" offset="2144110">And, he says, for the present, we will be restrained in to distance of one sea league.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.650" offset="2173994">He, after, would had repudiated that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.225" offset="2184234">He, after -- that is, he repudiated the idea that that three miles had been fixed or agreed upon as a national boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.391" offset="2220910">And, Your Honors will not find any single treaty entered into by the United States wherein the territorial waters were limited to three miles, nor will you find it any -- in any Act of Congress, until the passage of the Submerged Lands Act and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act in 1953, if those Acts could be construed to have that meaning and, of course, we say they do not.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="557.342" stopTime="567.052">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="557.342" offset="2332714">But, internationally, the claim or the position of the United States in matters of the international law, so-called, are not to be found merely in treaties.</text>

            <label>Mr. W. Scott Wilkinson</label>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="567.304" offset="2372629">It would be found in the continuous practice of the Government.</text>

            <label>Mr. W. Scott Wilkinson</label>
            <text syncTime="570.167" offset="2384018">Yes, sir, that's -- that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.723" offset="2390288">And, I would be glad to go into the continuous practice of the Government particularly with regard to the Gulf of Mexico because we have to bear in mind that when Louisiana was admitted to the Union, the Gulf of Mexico occupied quite a different status than it occupies today.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.853" offset="2474820">The Gulf of Mexico, then, was an enclosed sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.642" offset="2489971">As a matter of fact, up until 1800, the whole circumference of the Gulf was owned by the Kingdom of Spain.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.131" offset="2519855">Not another Union -- not another nation in the United States had a foot of ground boarding on the Gulf of Mexico prior to 1800 when Spain retroceded the territory of Louisiana to France and then, in 1803, when France ceded it to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.262" offset="2592371">Just before that occurred, Spain owned the entire circumference of the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.583" offset="2613687">There never been any big battles fought in the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.439" offset="2625076">As a matter of fact, I only remember one naval engagement in the war between the states when a car gets fleet to take Mobile Bay and, the other, when the marines attacked at Veracruz.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.784" offset="2678471">The big battles of the world have been fought on the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans in all time.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.094" offset="2699786">The Atlantic Ocean then was a great avenue and the great highway of commerce in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.978" offset="2719326">The Gulf of Mexico was an enclosed sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.352" offset="2732805">And, Your Honors will find, in reading the statements of the Secretaries of State of the United States, all along, many of those statements are qualified by the statement that this Government has subscribed to the principle of a territorial limit of three miles on our eastern coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.493" offset="2817337">And, of course, that's because there was a difference and there should be a difference between our eastern coast and the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.268" offset="2856417">Now, the Act of Admission of Louisiana into the Union in 1812 describes its limits as being bounded on the south by the Gulf of Mexico including all islands within three leagues of its coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.479" offset="2929246">This Act of Admission was antedated by the Act creating the Territory of Orleans in 1804.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.790" offset="2974490">The territory of Orleans, after, what became the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.910" offset="2994970">That Act creating the Territory of Orleans described the boundaries of Louisiana as being all -- Territory of Orleans as being all that part of the Territory of Louisiana briefly south of the 33rd parallel of latitude, which is a present northern boundary of the State of Louisiana was, that, without any exception, without the reservation of any seas, islands, submerged lands or waters or anything of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.123" offset="3111894">The Enabling Act or Act of 1811 provided that the State of Louisiana might be incorporated into a state in the Union, admitted on an equal footing with other states, comprising all that Territory of Louisiana within the following limits, and then, proceed to detail description ending up including all islands within three leagues of its shore -- coast, I mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.547" offset="3225579">Well, I'm not sure if it's a coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.717" offset="3246268">Now, our -- our position on that subject is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.231" offset="3276257">That either that means that our limits, our three leagues from the coast or else, that is not a clear description.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.916" offset="3331009">We say that the Act has been interpreted by the acts, by the contemporary construction over a long period of time, by the legislature and by the officials of Louisiana, as well as by the actions of the United States Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.552" offset="3393599">The citizens of Louisiana had, from time and memorial, made use of the oyster beds and leased them for private exploitation in the Gulf of Mexico, three leagues and even beyond three leagues from the shores of Louisiana and within the mine shown on the map here as the Louisiana boundary of the Act 33 of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.396" offset="3496939">The shoaled of the State of Louisiana come out into the Golf here, as far out as what they call the coastguard line.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.352" offset="3532779">There are places there where there are less than two fathoms in depth.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.728" offset="3550333">That is a very narrow coast and, the coast there, the coast line changes sometimes from day to day.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.490" offset="3589308">In the case of a great storm, their coastline has been washed inland by the action of the storm and the waves to take off as much a half-a mile at a time.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.145" offset="3631940">We have an island on the shoreline of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.269" offset="3644479">Timbalier Island has actually moved sideways and northwestern -- northwesterly, positioned nine miles such the state entered into the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.867" offset="3686797">It's an unusual coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.293" offset="3704560">Louisiana passed laws and, throughout its history, has passed laws and enforced laws not only leasing the bed of the Gulf of Mexico for oysters and for regulating the trawling for shrimp and, by the way, shrimp are sedentary fishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.240" offset="3784286">They are the natural resources of the seabed and the subsoil according to many definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.983" offset="3811349">Those operations go 40 and 50 miles off shore.</text>

            <text syncTime="3449.182" offset="13900152">It is perfectly proper for the Congress to say that the boundaries may extend three leagues in the Gulf of Mexico.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack P. F. Gremillion</label>
            <text syncTime="5097.919" offset="20495026">Mr. Justice Black and Your Honors, I should like to start very briefly with the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5107.552" offset="20533582">But, I should like to point out that the same session of Congress also passed the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5117.686" offset="20574124">I should like to point out that, in the Submerged Lands Act, the Congress gave definitions, the Congress gave a relinquishment or a quick claim or a conveyance of lands within -- submerged lands within three miles to all of the states, and the Congress gave to each of the states in the -- their border on the Gulf of Mexico the right to prove that their boundaries went further, if they could do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5153.701" offset="20718216">And, that would be a very poor concession to have made to the states who were arguing for that right if the Congress had meant “but when you get to Court, you will find that the right is empty because you, if you prove it, can get nothing from it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5172.419" offset="20793031">Now, the same Congress passed the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and, when it did so, it did not say that our Outer Continental Shelf begins three miles from the coast or even three miles from the shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="5191.177" offset="20868054">It said it begins from where the submerged lands, the boundaries established under the Submerged Lands Act, leave off.</text>
            <text syncTime="5203.106" offset="20915806">To turn to the Act -- the language of Congress, the term “Outer Continental Shelf,” and that's on page 6 of our brief, means all submerged lands lying seaward and outside of the area of lands beneath navigable waters as defined in Section 1301 of this Title and, of which, the subsoil and seabed appertain to the United States and are subject to jurisdiction and control.</text>
            <text syncTime="5234.092" offset="21039731">And so, the same Congress made a distinction between the lands it was dealing with for the states and the lands it was dealing with in connection with the Outer Continental Shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="5247.134" offset="21091871">And may I say here that it was not only the Congress, but the President also, for the President signed these Acts and both political branches of the Government, the Executive as well as the Legislative, said that the Gulf states would be permitted to prove that they had three leagues when they came into the Union or that three leagues had been approved thereafter if they could, and it is -- it is unthinkable to me that the President and the Congress would say that we would have the right to do it, but that a Cabinet officer of the same President would say “but we can't have the right to do it because the national boundaries never went so far.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5304.305" offset="21320600">As a matter of fact, Mr. Dulles does not say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5308.305" offset="21336586">And, if you will refer to his letter, which appears in the Government's brief, he took care really not to say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5318.595" offset="21377755">On page 178 of the brief, after talking about Mr. Jefferson's care in this matter, and you will remember that Mr. Jefferson said the least we have is three-miles but he didn't say we don't have more, and Mr. Dulles in his letter to Mr. Brownell says that the caution which led Jefferson to reserve for further consideration the claims of the United States in this matter continued to mark the position of this Government for a few years after the turn of the century.</text>
            <text syncTime="5356.562" offset="21529579">That's in the middle of page 178.</text>
            <text syncTime="5359.129" offset="21539924">Now, how many years after the turn of the century?</text>
            <text syncTime="5362.833" offset="21554657">Louisiana came into the Union in 1812.</text>
            <text syncTime="5367.989" offset="21575346">Louisiana had its Enabling Act in 1811.</text>
            <text syncTime="5372.816" offset="21594676">The Louisiana purchase or session was in 1803.</text>
            <text syncTime="5377.367" offset="21612857">All of these were a few years after the turn of the century.</text>
            <text syncTime="5381.878" offset="21630934">In 1811, we were to have, and in 1812, all islands within three leagues of the coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="5392.278" offset="21672521">In 1817, Mississippi was to have all islands within six leagues of the shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="5400.611" offset="21705853">In 1819, Alabama was to have all islands within six leagues of the shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="5408.378" offset="21736887">In 1819, we make a Treaty with Mexico discussing three leagues, and so on and on and on, and no date does Mr. Dulles suggest prior to 1862 when he says “the policy of the United States as to three miles became firm and it was not applied to the Gulf of Mexico.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5433.790" offset="21838555">And, there is nothing whatever to limit the territory of the United States two-three miles in the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="5443.315" offset="21876590">And, the President of the United States and the Congress of the United States, by the Submerged Lands Acts and by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, show as positively as people can that they think the boundary of the United States extends at least three leagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="5461.282" offset="21948479">Now, there is a difference on the Atlantic Coast, on the Pacific Coast where the Continental Shelf dropped sharply, and from our coast where it tapers off gradually.</text>
            <text syncTime="5475.912" offset="22006993">And, I think that Congress meant -- I think that the Congress, in 1811 and in those days when the only mode of transportation in our area of the country that meant anything was by water, I think that they didn't use words carelessly with respect to the three great States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="5498.262" offset="22096436">I think they knew what they were talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="5500.790" offset="22106572">And, I think that when they talk about our coast and the -- talk about the shores of Mississippi and the shores of Alabama, they understood that there was a difference and they didn't use the words meaninglessly but meaningfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="5517.159" offset="22171982">And, I think we ought to be permitted to show that and to show that, through out in dealing with Louisiana and from the very beginning, that the Congress has always talked about our coast as distinguished from our shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="5534.502" offset="22241364">Now, I would like to go a little bit further back.</text>
            <text syncTime="5537.833" offset="22254738">I'd like to go to what I grew up calling the Louisiana purchase but what we now call the Louisiana session.</text>
            <text syncTime="5545.482" offset="22285249">And, when that wonderful Act was written in 1803, France ceded to us not only the mainland, but they said in the session made by the preceding article are included the adjacent islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="5577.249" offset="22412413">Now, I -- I emphasize the word “adjacent” because, to me as a lawyer and to Your Honors as Justices, I am sure it has a significant meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="5589.923" offset="22463091">Adjacent, to me, means in join -- adjoining, that there is not something separating one from the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="5598.296" offset="22496528">And France ceded to us this mainland and the adjacent islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="5605.737" offset="22526307">It didn't say within three leagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="5607.368" offset="22532890">It didn't say within 10 leagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="5608.887" offset="22538951">It didn't say within 20 leagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="5610.848" offset="22546787">But, it said the adjacent islands as a part and parcel of the same thing, that the hare was going with the hide, and the United States got all of it -- all of these islands.Well, where were they?</text>
            <text syncTime="5627.398" offset="22612929">When the United States undertook to form Louisiana within certain limits under the Enabling Act of February 1911, the United States drew a line not just the Congress, but the President, the entire political branches of the Government drew a line in the Gulf of Mexico and they said three leagues from coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="5651.326" offset="22708642">And, they did the same thing when they got to Mississippi and when they got to Alabama, expect that they said six leagues from shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="5659.935" offset="22743124">But, they were drawing a line because everyone must have believed then that in order for the United States to own these islands in the Gulf of Mexico, at least those acquired by purchase from France under the language I have just read, that for us to own them, we own them as a part of that purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="5684.450" offset="22841135">And, when they established the State of Louisiana, these islands adjacent -- adjacent to the mainland, those surrounded by water at the surface of the water, were given to us and that carried the submerged land with it as clearly as could be.</text>

            <text syncTime="5736.498" offset="23049383">In our treaty with England, the people who drew that Act said North America and all islands within 20 leagues of the -- of the shore or maybe all islands within 20 leagues of the coast, and there could have been an international belt in between because that didn't say adjacent islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="5773.673" offset="23198072">But, in our case -- in our case, the descriptive words, and this was a big land deal and then people were trying to be careful and talk about what they meant, and it was an important land deal to the United States because, from the very beginning of our independence, our people started talking about an outlet to the Gulf of Mexico through the Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="5801.646" offset="23309981">And, I remember that, in the very year of our independence, Mr. Morrison wrote to Mr. Jefferson and said, “we'd have to have it, and if you can't get it at New Orleans, get it at Baton Rouge,” which is my home town.</text>
            <text syncTime="5814.932" offset="23363062">And, from -- from the beginning, they knew that they had to get to the open sea that there were not to be left any belt between them and the open sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="5828.489" offset="23417292">The open sea was the -- was the travel lane by which people leave, and we were going there by one means or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="5838.974" offset="23459297">In my part of the state, the Florida parishes, the people seized the Government and invited the United States in because United States didn't claim it at once.</text>
            <text syncTime="5850.376" offset="23504854">The title to it was clarified later and -- and, so, we have the Florida parishes because there was a doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5859.006" offset="23539440">But, at least as to the sea, there was no doubt because that's where they were going and they bought the mainland and the adjacent islands out to the open sea, and they meant to give it to us because there was no other state to use that territory below or south of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="5879.684" offset="23622092">Now, I'd like to say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5882.998" offset="23635362">The -- when the Congress, in 1811, said that we were to have a state, listen to the language they used.</text>
            <text syncTime="5896.090" offset="23687711">The area contained within the following limits, and then they set the limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="5903.808" offset="23718640">That's on page 70 of our brief -- of our appendix -- the appendix to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5910.134" offset="23743927">And, they set the limits and they described these limits as surely and as definitely, and as clearly as people could do it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="5920.714" offset="23786245">I agree that the submerged lands didn't attract the attention that the waters did in those days.</text>
            <text syncTime="5929.226" offset="23820309">But, certainly, no one had in mind that there was a foreign belt or an International belt between our mainland and islands adjacent to our coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="5945.769" offset="23886451">And, when they said three leagues from our coast in the Enabling Act, they were drawing, and we can prove that they were drawing, a line which encompassed the islands as they had been were.</text>
            <text syncTime="5963.457" offset="23957191">And, I say that by any legal tests, Louisiana is entitled to that much.</text>
            <text syncTime="5973.545" offset="23997524">I -- I believe that Mr. Wilkinson had made it abundantly clear that every official Act of our Government concerning the Gulf of Mexico, including the Submerged Lands Act which comes from the Congress and from the President, set three leagues as our measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5996.233" offset="24088325">I say it would be utterly meaningless to say that Louisiana is to have these adjacent islands -- adjacent islands but not the land under the water which makes them adjacent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6011.899" offset="24151019">If that land were in some International area, the islands could not be adjacent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6020.138" offset="24183933">And, I think we are entitled to so much.</text>
            <text syncTime="6031.611" offset="24229804">I should like to close this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6035.921" offset="24247045">The Government's brief here, the last brief, on page 3 talks about “the additional provisions the Gulf states could obtain submerged land out to three leagues if they could prove that they had boundaries that far out when they entered the Union or if such boundaries were thereafter approved by Congress did not reflect a congressional view that such boundaries were possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="6079.196" offset="24420185">I do not think that this Court can accept the view that the Congress and the President satisfied the Gulf state by presenting a will of the wisp that could not be realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="6098.143" offset="24495940">I think we are entitled to proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="6101.507" offset="24509419">I think as a matter of fact, the Enabling Act considered with the purchase proves of itself that we have three leagues and three leagues from the coast because that is the language of the Enabling Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6118.658" offset="24577964">I think all that really and rightfully remains is for us to show where is the coast, and I hope this Court will give us the opportunity to do that.</text>
