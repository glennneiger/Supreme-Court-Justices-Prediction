            <label>Mr. Carl H. Imlay</label>
            <text syncTime="14.158" offset="159953">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.433" offset="165073">I should first like to review the background of the administrative proceedings, deportation proceedings in this case and to summarize the evidence upon which the order of deportation is founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.389" offset="232887">At the close of yesterday's session, I believe I had pointed out that -- of course, the deportation charge here is that the petitioner was a member of the Communist Party in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.608" offset="317837">Now, going back, I -- I would like to just briefly summarize the previous administrative proceedings leading up to the hearing and the granting of the orders of deportation now attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.447" offset="385128">Petitioner was first ordered deported in 1936 on the basis of membership and an organization advocating the overthrow of the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.134" offset="443956">And after this Court's opinion in Kessler versus Strecker in which this Court decided that the 1918 Act applied only to present membership in the -- in an organization advocating overthrow of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.955" offset="535176">In 1942, these proceedings were canceled.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.441" offset="557119">The Kessler case was in 1939, and the Court will recall that the Alien Registration Act of 1940 was passed the next year in order to extend the policy of -- of the 1918 Act to pass membership in organizations advocating overthrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.353" offset="672789">Subsequently, new proceedings were commenced in 1948 under this 1940 law and these proceedings were invalidated by this Court's decision in Wong Yang Sung versus McGrath because the -- this 1948 proceedings didn't comply with the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.809" offset="778637">Then, after Congress had, in the Appropriation Act of 1951, exempted deportation hearings from the Administrative Procedure Act, a new hearing was commenced on February 16th, 1951 at which time an additional charge under the Section 22 of the Internal Security Act of 1950 was lodged against the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.069" offset="903607">And the petitioner was given time he -- that hearing -- that February 16th hearing was adjourned at March 28th, 1951 to allow the petitioner time to meet the additional charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.258" offset="980407">I might say this -- this time of -- at the time of this March 28th hearing, March 28th, 1951, the -- well, the same day that that hearing was conducted, the Act of March 28th, 1951, which we've set forth at page 3 of our brief, became law.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.770" offset="1118438">I think that perhaps our brief is a little misleading because I think we stated that this Act become law before the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.567" offset="1165667">Well, actually, it became law the same day that the principle hearing in this case was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.279" offset="1200462">This Act of March 28th, 1951 was a clarifying act.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.863" offset="1226794">I'll get -- I'm going to discuss the legislative history of that Act throwing light on the 1950 Act in a few minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.971" offset="1283218">At this second hearing, well, at the first hearing, the petitioner admitted his alienage and that he was last a citizen of Germany.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.027" offset="1331493">And at this March 28th hearing, he refused to answer whether he'd been a member of the Communist Party or whether he was a member of the Communist Party in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.185" offset="1400142">He was represented by counsel at this hearing and at all subsequent proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.022" offset="1431489">When the -- when petitioner refused to state his membership, the -- the service introduced two documents into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.828" offset="1494706">The Exhibit 5 was a verified copied of a petition for writ of habeas corpus dated November 8th, 1949 in which the petitioner admitted that in truth and fact, he had seized membership in the Communist Party USA in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.522" offset="1589478">The petitioner refused to answer whether he files such a petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.444" offset="1613197">He made an objection to the admission of this petition on the grounds of -- that it wasn't material.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="385.782" offset="1646529">Is that petition in the record?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carl_h_imlay" startTime="388.860" stopTime="631.734">
            <label>Mr. Carl H. Imlay</label>
            <text syncTime="388.860" offset="1658859">No, it isn't, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.589" offset="1665755">It's merely adverted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.075" offset="1679653">In the hearing officer's decision, the hearing officer states that he faced his -- his decision partly on that Exhibit 5 and partly on Exhibit 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.312" offset="1748616">Now, Exhibit 4, which was introduced into evidence on that hearing, was the sworn testimony of the petitioner given before an immigration inspector on January 10th, 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.402" offset="1824998">And the transcript, which is, of course, printed in the record, in the transcript, it was -- petitioner admitted that he was an alien, last a citizen of Germany.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.528" offset="1921442">And after being sworn, this is in 1947, he admitted that he joined the Communist Party and another organization, the Workers' Alliance in the spring or early summer of 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.887" offset="1986957">He also admitted that he paid dues in the Party and he attended meetings where the members talked about fighting for the daily needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.781" offset="2026454">He gave his -- his reason for joining on page 26 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.463" offset="2061249">The fact that the Communist Party had one aim to get something to eat for the people and that everybody around me had the idea that we had to fight for something to eat and clothes and shelter.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.744" offset="2118301">In a subsequent portion of the record, page 31, he further explained that, in answer to a question as to whether he joined -- whether he's joining the Communist Party, he was motivated by dissatisfaction and living under a democracy that it wasn't that no -- that it was just a matter of having no jobs at that time, and he stated, "We wanted something to eat and something to crawl into."</text>
            <text syncTime="536.937" offset="2251107">And then he was asked, “You say you'd fight for something to eat and crawl into, what do you mean by that term?”</text>
            <text syncTime="543.907" offset="2279006">Then he explained this statement, "We had to go and ask those who had it."</text>
            <text syncTime="551.617" offset="2309831">That was the courthouse at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.137" offset="2319966">We petitioned city, state and national government.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.305" offset="2332609">We did and we succeeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.413" offset="2341073">We finally got unemployment laws and a certain budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.403" offset="2356955">Even at the few communist meetings I attended, nothing was ever said about overthrowing anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.413" offset="2385063">All they talked about was fighting for the daily needs.”</text>
            <text syncTime="575.194" offset="2404185">Then he was asked whether he was an active worker in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.369" offset="2424874">And he replied, “The only active work I did was running the bookstore for a while.”</text>
            <text syncTime="586.470" offset="2449220">And then as was -- we -- Mr. Rein discussed yesterday, he -- he admitted that he didn't get a penny there, that he was a salesman in there but the Communist Party ran the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.050" offset="2511600">He secured his employment through the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.871" offset="2530826">And this store was an official outlet for communist literature in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.867" offset="2562800">And he also explained that this bookstore handled many of the communist classics and socialist literature.</text>
