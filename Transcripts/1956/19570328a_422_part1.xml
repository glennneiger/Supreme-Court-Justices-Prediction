            <label>Mr. Joseph E. Finley</label>
            <text syncTime="35.766" offset="246471">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.178" offset="256084">This case presents the important public issue of whether or not labor unions, when dealing with their own employees, must obey the law in the same fashion as do commercial employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.113" offset="303835">The case arose in 1954 in Portland, Oregon, where the Teamsters Unions there were allegedly involved in unfair labor practices against their own employees, that is their office and clerical employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.051" offset="363604">Petitioner, which is a local union of the Office Employes International Union, filed these charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.722" offset="398294">The matter came on for hearing before a trial examiner of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.100" offset="415744">And on the merits of the case, the trial examiner found the six Teamster respondents and I refer to them here as Teamster respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.160" offset="448031">Before the Board there was International Brotherhood of Teamsters, two of its locals, the Joint Council and two other subsidiary organizations and we lumped them together as labor organizations as Teamster respondents for the purposes of arguing this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.897" offset="498918">The examiner found on the merits that the Teamsters Unions toward their own employees violated Sections 8 (a) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 encompassing all the unfair -- employer unfair labor practice provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.942" offset="559104">On the question of Board jurisdiction, which is the only question, the only legal question before this Court, the examiner found that the Teamster organizations were integral parts of a multistate enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.030" offset="611453">He found that in 1953, the year prior to the hearing, some approximately $6 million induce an initiation fees across state lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.743" offset="650324">The examiner further found that since the Board normally asserts its jurisdiction over multistate enterprises, it would assert jurisdiction here.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.097" offset="691806">The case came on before the NLRB and the Board split three ways, the controlling decision of -- then Chairman Farmer and member Peterson, which is the decision we are challenging here, held in substance that the Teamsters as unions were not engaged in a proper enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.880" offset="762859">They were not engaged in commercial business and that the Board normally, so that decision said, did not assert its jurisdiction over so-called nonprofit non-commercial organizations, and since the Teamsters were not nonprofit non-commercial, we will not assert our jurisdiction over them because it will not effectuate the policies of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.095" offset="843734">Member Murdock in a separate concurring opinion read the congressional intent is not to include union as employers engaging -- when they are engaged their trade union capacities, and he voted to dismiss the complaints also.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.638" offset="897964">Two dissenting Board members took the position that the Board should assert its jurisdiction, and they relied largely, I think, upon the equity principle that if commercial employers must obey the law towards their own employees, so should organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.050" offset="959613">In the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia Circuit, that Court in a 2-to-1 decision affirmed the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.758" offset="990438">The Court of Appeals said that the Board had a wide discretion in the exercise of its jurisdiction and that it had made a rational finding in lumping these labor unions in a category with other nonprofit non-commercial organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.075" offset="1047698">And therefore, this was a rational finding and they would not disturb it.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.924" offset="1063058">Now, Judge Bazelon dissented, a very short dissent saying that the reference in Section 2 (2) of the Act, which I will refer to in a moment, to labor unions distinguish them from the normal nonprofit non-commercial organization or which the Board had refused to take jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.789" offset="1134529">Now, Section 2 (2) of the Act which -- from which this controversy flows was enacted -- remains the same today as it was when it was enacted in the law in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.021" offset="1183431">Now, Section 2 (2) defines employers and excludes therefrom labor organizations (other than when acting as an employer) and that's the statutory language here that we come -- we bring this case on.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.600" offset="1257723">Now, petitioners first element of argument is that the Board in declining, and I say declining to assert its jurisdiction, ignored the intent of Congress in enacting this specific provision of Section 2 (2) and that is arbitrary and capricious to ignore the congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.811" offset="1350614">And our second contention is that in any event it was arbitrary to place unions in a category with a university or a symphony orchestra or a live (Inaudible) or something of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.301" offset="1400560">Now, let us look for a moment at the legislative history of this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.228" offset="1436296">The first comprehensive Labor Act was introduced by Senator Wagner in 1934 in the 73rd Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.286" offset="1468479">Senator Wagner in his employer definition section excluded labor organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.072" offset="1499617">The bill was referred to committee, hearings were held and the Senate Labor Committee and I might say which Mr. Justice Black was a member at that time, reported the bill out and changed the language of Section 2 (2) to read exactly as it does today.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.193" offset="1560116">And the Committee put in the parenthetical expression other than when acting as an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.565" offset="1585612">And accompanying that bill out of committee was Senate Report Number 1184 in the 73rd Congress, which is set forth -- the pertinent provisions are set forth on page 13 of the petitioner's brief, it's in the Board brief and the essential notation is that the congressional committee referred to the same kind of people who are involved in this case, clerks, secretaries and the like, office employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.652" offset="1681951">The Committee said every labor organizations -- in one sense every labor organization is an employer, it hires clerks, secretaries and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.346" offset="1712776">In its relations with its own employees, a labor organization ought to be treated as an employer, and the bill so provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.069" offset="1755617">The labor bill field of enactment in the 73rd Congress and when the 74th Congress convened in 1935, Senator Wagner again introduced his labor bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.726" offset="1794278">And once again, Senator Wagner went back to his original language, he just exclude labor organizations and did not have the parenthetical expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.938" offset="1827088">The bill went to committee, the Senate Labor Committee, with again Mr. Justice Black was a member of that committee, reported the bill out and changed the language once again back to the same language as it had done in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.558" offset="1873586">And that bill S1958 became the National Labor Relations Act, the Wagner Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.205" offset="1896155">And the statutory language has remained the same to this day.</text>

            <text syncTime="515.294" offset="2164590">Well, are you suggesting from what you now giving is in a way of legislative history that there is in effect the mandate upon the Board in the cases where apart from the question Justice Douglas just referred to where the union is an employer, that the Congress contemplated that other provisions of the Act being met, that the Board would exercise jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="546.617" offset="2289873">I think the point I'm making here is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.050" offset="2303561">The Board may not decline to assert it's jurisdiction over labor organizations all together as employers in view of the statutory language and in view of the specific legislative history would show the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.624" offset="2353821">It's when the Board collides with the intent of Congress as expressed in the history that it takes an arbitrary point of view.</text>

            <text syncTime="581.094" offset="2427800">No, sir, it does not and that is one of the crucial points in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.226" offset="2448280">Section 10 (a), as we all know, provides that the Board is empowered to prevent unfair labor practices not directed as the courts below have held many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.696" offset="2490180">And the Board reads that in a broad discretion and how it will deal with unfair labor practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.068" offset="2511600">Now, this to me in this particular case means that the Board yet may exercise a discretion as to whether or not it will remedy a particular unfair labor practice or not, as to whether or not effectuation -- a remedy will effectuate the policies of the Act in the particular facts and the particular circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.974" offset="2591222">But I don't believe that Section 10 (a)'s language allows the Board to take a whole class of employers and just remove them from the coverage of the Act under a claim discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1638.461" offset="6657233">Let me say first that the nub of the petitioner's case here as we see it, as we understand it is that the Board may not adopt an administrative jurisdictional standard, the effect of which is -- the result of which is to exclude labor organizations when acting as an employers from the coverage of the statute as a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.153" offset="6748035">Now, while I shall address myself to that question in the course of my time, a serious doubt has arisen in our minds at least whether this question is presently a right for adjudication by this Court in view of the posture of this case before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.161" offset="6823999">Now, let me explain briefly what the posture of this case was before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.312" offset="6836642">As Mr. Finley has indicated, there were charges filed here against a number of labor organizations and it was claimed that these various labor organizations had engaged in numerous unfair labor practices with respect to their own employees and their normal functions with or their union functions in order to defeat the efforts of the petition to represent these employees for purpose of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.324" offset="6924622">Now, the trial examiner found that these labor organizations were employers with the meaning of the statute, that their activities affected interstate commerce, that their activities also met the Board's jurisdictional test with respect to the multistate enterprises and that it would effectuate the policies of the statute to assert jurisdiction and then he went on to find on the merits of the unfair labor practice charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.959" offset="7023156">Now --</text>

            <text syncTime="1734.278" offset="7040502">Now, when the case came before the Board, this is the posture before the Board, four members of the Board agreed with the trial examiner that these labor organizations were employers within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.336" offset="7100688">Two of -- of these four -- these four Board members assumed that the interstate transactions of -- of these various unions satisfied the Board's legal test of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.085" offset="7155754">However, they divided on the policy question as to whether or not they should or should not assert jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.061" offset="7179577">Two of those four board members concluded that -- that they would not assert jurisdiction because they regarded these labor organizations in the same category as the Board regards nonprofit enterprises which are now engaged in commercial enterprise -- in commercial ventures in the normally accepted sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.483" offset="7261288">And on the basis of that policy, two of these Board members voted to dismiss the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.556" offset="7281560">The other two Board members would have asserted jurisdiction on the same basis that the trial examiner did, they said that as a matter of policy we think we ought to assert jurisdiction.The fifth board member who is Mr. Murdock, Mr. Murdock said, "I will vote to dismiss the complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.913" offset="7355016">I will join my two colleagues who are voting to dismiss the complaint on policy grounds but I joined them on an entirely different ground, namely, that the labor organizations are not enforced when they are acting in their normal capacity as distinguished from engaging in some commercial enterprise."</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.478" offset="7429308">Now in short, you have -- the complaint here was dismissed because one board member, Mr. Murdock, thought that the Board lacked power all together over this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1854.653" offset="7521991">And so that you have four Board members who divided evenly, two and two, on the question of policy with the decisive vote being cast by Senator Murdock who concurred in the dismissal of the complaint on power -- on lack of power, that the Board lacked power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.841" offset="7590745">Now, we have suggested in our brief and not because of the change of personnel, it maybe noted as a fact of life that there has been a change of personnel on the Board but certainly we would make the same suggestion today even if there had been no change of personnel on the Board and that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.548" offset="7657514">That we think that perhaps the appropriate course for this Court is to resolve the threshold question, the question on which Senator Murdock or Mr. Murdock went off on, namely, whether a labor organization when acting as an employer in his normal functions is within the coverage of the statute, if of course this Court decides that Senator Murdock is correct in that view, that's the end of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.852" offset="7758764">If on the other hand, this Court agrees with the four Board members that a labor organization is an employer within the meaning of the statute even when acting in its normal capacity, then we suggest that this Court addressed itself to the Murdock position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.076" offset="7827728">And if it concludes that the Senator is wrong, if it concludes that -- that the majority of the Board is correct in -- in saying that a labor organization in its normal capacity is an employer within the meaning of the statute, then we think that the case should be remanded to the Board so that all five Board members starting from a common premise may then determine whether or not --</text>

            <text syncTime="2276.098" offset="9207724">This is a very unique case, Your Honor, if someone said it's a free case I'm quite -- I'm quite well to believe that it is.Let me go on now and assuming that what the Board majority has done, I suppose the Court would like to hear on discussion of that from us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.281" offset="9280449">Let's assume that it's been a majority of the Board that has said we will adopt the standard here and as Mr. Finley says the effect of that standard is to exclude labor organizations when acting as an employer from the coverage of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.895" offset="9338964">Now, essentially, Mr. Finley's position on that is that in view of the specific designation of labor organizations as employers within the definition of that term in Section 2 (2) of the statute, that the Board is precluded from adopting a standard which would mean the exclusion of -- of labor organizations as a class from the coverage of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.038" offset="9443558">Now, preliminarily, I should say that -- that this argument overlooks the fact that the Board's power with respect to the exercise of its discretion does not stem from Section 2 (2) of the statute but rather from Section 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.106" offset="9511790">Section 2 (2) of the statute merely defines a term employers who are within the coverage of the statute, but it is Section 10 of the Act, however, which vest authority in the Board to take action, to exercise it's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.330" offset="9568737">And that Section of the -- that Section of the statute as this Court had very reasonable case and they're not noticed is cast in permissive terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.087" offset="9603741">The statute says that the Board is empowered to prevent any person from engaging unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.960" offset="9627251">It shall have the power to issue complaints, and the statute also gives the Board a broad discretion with respect to whether or not what type of order will effectuate the policies of the Act and even where it enters an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.020" offset="9675421">The Board may or may not as complete discretion on the matter whether to seek judicial enforcement of its orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.180" offset="9700080">What I'm getting at is this that the whole tenure of Section 10 is cast in the permissive language and we believe that that Section of the statute vest in the Board the power to determine the discretionary authority, to determine whether or not the public interest will be better served, whether the posture of the statute will be better effectuated by asserting or declining to assert its jurisdiction over a particular case or a class of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.975" offset="9815228">Now, Mr. Finley says, well, the Board may -- may have the power, it would have some discretion perhaps to decline -- to assert its jurisdiction but it can't adopt the standard which excludes a whole class of employers from the -- from the coverage of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.843" offset="9890774">I suggest Your Honor that in dealing with that issue that the -- the fact that a Board administrative standard may exclude a whole class of employers from the coverage of the statute of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.342" offset="9948766">Well, that's the administrative policies in effect does not necessarily -- does not necessarily destroy the validity of the standard, that the decisive factor is what are the underlying reasons that -- that lead the Board, prompt the Board to adopt such a standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.092" offset="10023790">Now, take this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.257" offset="10032358">Here -- again, I am assuming you that this is the Board majority position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.334" offset="10044688">Actually, it's the position of only two members of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.014" offset="10059421">Here, the Board said in effect that we think that these labor organizations, they're of not of a nonprofit character, they're not engaged in the commercial venture and we think that we ought to treat to them just as we treat for jurisdictional purposes that we think we ought to treat them just like we treat other types of nonprofit non-commercial enterprises, not --</text>
