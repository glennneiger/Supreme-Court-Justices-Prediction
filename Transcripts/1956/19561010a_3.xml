            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 29, Junius Irving Scales, Petitioner, versus United States of America.</text>

            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="11.966" offset="151280">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.337" offset="168730">This case comes up here from the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.670" offset="186075">It's also a Smith Act case, but it is not a conspiracy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.898" offset="210944">And it comes up here under a provision of the Smith Act that has not hitherto then before this Court for review and consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.144" offset="231946">Perhaps, the Court would like to look at it right at the outset and my brief in the appendix of page 48 sets forth the language of the Smith Act showing this clause and its context.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.849" offset="322748">The Court will recall that there are three basic paragraphs in the Smith Act, one prohibiting advocacy, one on the distribution of literature, and one on organizing groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.870" offset="378859">And the conspiracy cases that have hitherto come here have been for conspiracy to violate the first and third paragraphs on advocacy and organizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.016" offset="423476">The clause for this action that this case comes under is the last clause of the third paragraph.And eliminating the part about organizing, which is not relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.904" offset="466944">It reads, "Whoever becomes or is a member of or affiliates with any such society, group or assembly of persons, knowing the purposes thereof shall be fined, imprisoned and so forth."</text>
            <text syncTime="105.910" offset="527026">And to such group refers back to the same groups that the other provisions of the Act is concerned, group of persons who advocate the overthrow of the Government by force or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.298" offset="576554">In short, this clause prescribes being a member of a group, the members of which advocate violent overthrow with knowledge that that is the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.781" offset="626500">Now, Your Honors, this case involves some of the same questions that you have heard discussed in the preceding cases, questions such as the sufficiency of the evidence about the Communist Party, the sufficiency of the evidence about an individual's connection with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.279" offset="720436">But the Court has heard considerable argument on these points.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.209" offset="736214">In the last two days, though not quite as much as I expected this morning when I came to Court, and for that reason it seems to me that it might be best for me to go immediately to the new questions in this case that are not presented in the prior cases because there are new constitutional and statutory problems arising here that I plan to focus my argument upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.671" offset="850108">There is the question of the constitutionality of this membership clause on its space and as applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.078" offset="903711">The -- to state very briefly, the question of constitutionality arises because this contains no prohibition of advocacy or incitement or organizing or conspiring, this is a prohibition of status plus state of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.368" offset="972884">Now the Court may not reach that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.477" offset="985318">The Court may not reach it because there is a statutory question here too, which maybe governing and the Court may prefer to approach constitutional questions last and not first as has been said.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.633" offset="1037876">And that question is whether the indictment here states an offense against the laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.158" offset="1067969">It arises because in 1950, 10 years after the Smith Act was passed, Congress enacted the Internal Security Act of 1950 including Section 4 (f) of that Act which you will find in the Appendix to my brief at page 49.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.833" offset="1158666">Section 4 (f) declares that neither the holding of office nor membership in any Communist organization, by any person, shall constitute per se a violation of subsection (a), or subsection (c) of this Section or of any other criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.127" offset="1259917">Now, that extension of the bar, whatever the bar is, to any other criminal statute, it is my argument that that presently bars the prosecution of Communists under the membership clause which is the clause that this case comes up under.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.360" offset="1332851">Whatever might be its effect on conspiracy cases that has an effect on the membership clause is to cut off the prosecution for Communists.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.335" offset="1372662">Now, after stating the case, I propose to focus my argument on these two questions, the statutory and the constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.101" offset="1399724">There are also these evidentiary questions which are raised in Yates and -- and were raised in Mesarosh.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.668" offset="1426056">And if time permits, I will say a few words about those as well as about the points relating to fair trial.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="336.640" stopTime="344.257">
            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="336.640" offset="1449984">Can you take a minute to state the -- what you call statutory question.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.261" offset="1468374">That isn't a question of criminal pleading, is it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="telford_taylor" startTime="344.257" stopTime="812.997">
            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="344.257" offset="1480391">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.565" offset="1481644">It is a question of -- of limitation of the scope of -- of the Smith Act by virtue of a subsequent Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.180" offset="1512051">It is not, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, a repeal of that, of the membership clause because the membership clause is left applicable to persons belonging to other organizations than a Communist Party, that is assuming it's constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.094" offset="1575790">But it is in our -- in my view a limitation of the membership clause by the -- an exclusionary limitation, an exclusionary limitation of Communists.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.857" offset="1614764">Now, might I say a preliminary word on the Government's past practice in the enforcement of this membership clause as compared to its enforcement of the other provisions of the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.574" offset="1669622">As the Court knows, the Dennis case was the first case against Communists under the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.529" offset="1701491">The defendants there were indicted not only in a single indictment for a conspiracy, but those defendants were also indicted in individual indictments under this same membership clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.127" offset="1763871">But before the case was tried, there was a motion to sever those individual indictments under the membership clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.824" offset="1798666">That motion is granted so that the Dennis defendants were tried only under the conspiracy indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.351" offset="1828760">However, those membership indictments have not been withdrawn, despite the lapse of eight years since 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.460" offset="1873168">Those membership indictments against the original Dennis defendants are still pending in the Southern District of New York, although there has never been any trial under those indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.580" offset="1925726">Now, after the Dennis case, the Government brought a series of conspiracy indictments similar to Dennis' indictment, similar to the cases that were here the last two days, against groups of Communist Party members and officers in various cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.369" offset="2008900">Those cases, those indictments all were laid after 1950 and therefore, after the enactment of this provision from the Internal Security Act that I've just read.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.848" offset="2062712">Whether or not that was the reason, I do not know, but the fact is that in those subsequent indictments, they did not undertake to indict the members individually under the membership clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.203" offset="2108165">There's the Fraenkel case in Baltimore and the Flynn case in New York in which this Court denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.374" offset="2132825">Then, this week, we have had the Yates and Mesarosh cases and none of those cases were there individual indictments under the membership clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.274" offset="2172426">They were indicted only for conspiracy, and that insofar as I know remained true until 1954, 1954 was the first occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.065" offset="2219656">Since 1948 when those original membership indictments went in against the Dennis defendants, it was the first occasion that the Government again sought to invoke this membership clause and it sought it in this case, which is now before you, and in the Lightfoot case coming from the Seventh Circuit, which is on argument following this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.370" offset="2300844">Only this case and the Lightfoot case under the membership clause have been reviewed in the Courts of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.865" offset="2326862">This one in the Fourth Circuit, Lightfoot in the Seventh, and in both of those cases, the conviction was affirmed and it was held that the Act was constitutional and that Section 4 (f) that I stressed is not a bar to prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.250" offset="2396348">Now, may I turn to the facts of this case, which I can state quite briefly because basically the questions here are legal, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.294" offset="2428531">The petitioner, Scales, was indicted on November 18th in North Carolina, Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.451" offset="2461132">The indictment is found on Page 1 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.141" offset="2479940">And I think it is important to take a look at that, because much of the argument will revolve around what is in it and what is not in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.936" offset="2519124">It is a very short and simple indictment entirely contained on that first page and it alleges four things.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.576" offset="2553710">The first paragraph alleges that the Communist Party is a society or group of persons who teach and advocate the overthrow of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.413" offset="2597073">The petitioner undertook to deny that allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.952" offset="2615150">Then, in the next paragraph, it is first alleged that the petitioner, Scales is a member of the Communist Party, that he did not undertake to deny and the record shows that he is an officer of the Party at the state level.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.849" offset="2682755">He is not a national officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.294" offset="2692577">He is Chairman of the Party in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.631" offset="2705847">On argument in the Yates case, government counsel analogized these cases by the number of stars the generals wore on their shoulder.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.400" offset="2744926">I do not know how many stars would be warranted for this particular office, but apart from that, this is a state level case, nothing higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.535" offset="2793514">Then, it is alleged that Scales knew the Communist Party to be a group that advocates overthrow by force or violence, and that is denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.618" offset="2833847">Finally, the last allegation according to Page 1 is that the defendant intended to bring about overthrow, violent overthrow, as speedily as circumstances permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.015" offset="2887450">That too is denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.945" offset="2895182">There is a legal question as to whether that allegation has any proper place in the indictment, in view of the fact that the membership clause specifies that membership and knowledge says nothing about intent, and I will discuss that question in due course.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.141" offset="2963937">The case went to trial in April of last year and Scales was found guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.352" offset="2988805">He got his six-year in jail much more easily than Mrs. Yates did.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.684" offset="3010121">He did not take the stand, had no contempt problem, but he was given six years for this offense, which is in fact a year more than any other defendant in the Smith Act case has gotten.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.970" offset="3059231">The reason for that is that the other defendants have been convicted under the general conspiracy statute, the maximum penalty underwhich until recently has been five -- the maximum penalty is five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.783" offset="3106461">Whereas, since this case came up under the Smith Act itself where the maximum penalty is 10 years, he could be given a longer sentence and he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.597" offset="3149720">The case was -- the conviction was affirmed below and the case came here on certiorari last March on four stated questions, of which I have already mentioned two, the constitutionality problem, the statutory problem under 4 (f) of the Internal Security Act, a question whether there is sufficient evidence of the Party's unlawful aims and sufficient evidence of Scales's guilty knowledge and intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.299" offset="3252537">That is sufficient to go to the jury or support a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.186" offset="3268106">And finally, there are four questions raised about the conduct of the trial of which probably the two most important are the method of impaneling the grand jury and the validity of certain rulings on the admissibility of evidence which Mr. Donner adverted to briefly this morning in discussing the questions which would be -- would have been presented under the Mesarosh case.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="812.997" offset="3355355">Are there any questions as to the judge's charge?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="telford_taylor" startTime="817.126" stopTime="1217.400">
            <label>Mr. Telford Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="817.126" offset="3371865">There are no questions raised on certiorari about the judge's charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.301" offset="3396524">I think, Your Honor, probably has in mind the problem of incitement or may have that in mind which is discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.522" offset="3417422">There was in this case, unlike the Yates case the same kind of a charge about incitement that Judge Medina gave in the Dennis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.976" offset="3463293">Now, might I say a few words about the evidence, which again I can do quite briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.978" offset="3483251">The prosecution called only three witnesses against Scales.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.303" offset="3508537">The first one was Lautner, John Lautner, who is a chronic witness in these cases and he made exactly the same kind of testimony as far as I know that he has given in the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.061" offset="3559633">He knew nothing about Scales, did not purport to know anything about petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.269" offset="3576456">He testified as an ex-member of the Communist Party about the doctrinal aims of the Party from which incidentally he resigned on January 17th, 1950, which is nearly five years before this indictment was brought and about two years before the statutory period of limitations under this indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.326" offset="3668720">In general, he -- he identified the classical writings that were discussed yesterday with Marx, Lenin, and Stalin.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.259" offset="3700381">He testified that the Communist Party of the United States where in its constitution or in other writings, it claims not to advocate force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.479" offset="3745311">Lautner says in his opinion not as a camouflage.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.424" offset="3761089">And he stated that Marxism-Leninism essentially means overthrow by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.822" offset="3790660">And that was in some substance of Lautner's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.399" offset="3804975">The other two witnesses are the ones who testified about petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.210" offset="3824201">They are both FBI informants who joined the Communist Party by prearrangement with the FBI to observe and report on what went on.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.861" offset="3866833">The first being a witness named Clontz and he met Scales in 1948, which again is a long time before the indictment of statutory period and was in contact with Scales until December 1951, which is just barely the beginning of the statutory period.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.595" offset="3949798">He testified primarily to numerous private conversations with Scales in which Scales has reported to have made statements upon which the Government relies heavily to show Scales' own personal belief in force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.474" offset="4021269">Then, the third witness, Childs, another FBI informant, sort of picks up chronologically where Clontz stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.749" offset="4050317">He was in contact with Scales during the statutory period and attended a party school in North Carolina which it had said Scales was the director of.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.511" offset="4097442">There is extensive testimony from Childs on what was taught of that school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.878" offset="4118862">On the record of his testimony, much was taught there that it is certainly highly controversial, certainly highly abhorrent to many Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.218" offset="4144253">But as I read the record, there is no showing that force and violence was part of the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.326" offset="4168704">That is the prosecutioner's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.762" offset="4178422">As to the defense, the petitioner did not testify and the evidence given in his behalf, which I have described in my brief for the information of the Court, does not in my opinion importantly affect the issues that are now open here on certiorari, as to those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.061" offset="4263581">As I have remarked, the Court may not have to reach the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.190" offset="4292106">But the constitutional and the statutory question, both depend on a careful reading of this membership clause to see what is in it and what isn't in it and I think it will be clearer if I tried to point out the constitutional issue first and then comes the statutory question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.686" offset="4370160">Although, Your Honors, may well decide to decide the case in reverse order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1074.488" offset="4401298">I would like the Court to consider just what the membership clause as applied in this indictment, seeks to imbue with a criminal seditious character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.291" offset="4460544">There is no charge in this case that the -- that Scales advocated violent overthrow or that he incited anybody to violent overthrow, or that he organized any group which was dedicated for the purpose of violent overthrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.682" offset="4526059">There is no charge that he conspired with anyone to do any one of those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.251" offset="4552391">There is in fact no act at all charged, unless remaining a member of the Party during the statutory period maybe considered an act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.310" offset="4596590">There is no concert of action, no agreement with anyone else charged in the indictment for any legal or illegal purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.601" offset="4641729">The defendants involved in the conspiracy cases that have just been before the Court, after all, are accused of being co-conspirators with the Dennis case defendants and they are the people who were supposed to have patched this conspiracy in 1945, and they are the leaders of the Party that is said to be the vehicle of the conspiracy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1186.397" offset="4848933">And actually, my argument with the Solicitor General is not joined on the basis of the membership clause as written, because as I read his brief, he does not undertake to defend the constitutionality of the membership clause as written.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.873" offset="6586911">The Solicitor General's position is that mens rea or guilty intent is often read into criminal statutes and that it should be done in this case in order to assist the constitutionality as an aid to interpreting the clause of being constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.348" offset="6656815">And he points to the Dennis case, where this Court did read the requirement of personal intent into the paragraphs dealing with advocacy and organizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.419" offset="6709060">Now, in fact, I think it is very difficult to read a personal intent in here and I will state briefly why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.981" offset="6743333">This membership clause is part of the Smith Act which in turn is modeled on a New York statute, which came before this Court in the Gitlow case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.799" offset="6790562">The resemblance between the Smith Act and the New York statute was commented on in the Dennis case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.671" offset="6818043">The New York statute contains a membership clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.198" offset="6832149">It was not involved in the Gitlow case, but it's been on the books there all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.668" offset="6850017">And the membership clause in the New York statute does not even require knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.276" offset="6876453">It is a naked prohibition of membership with no additional qualifications or limitations, and it was in that form that the Smith Act was first introduced in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.674" offset="6934026">The membership clause in the original Smith Act simply prohibited membership and did not require any joint personal knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.294" offset="6968508">That requirement, that personal knowledge, was added in the assigned judiciary committee by a specific amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.869" offset="7014797">That being so, and Congress having deliberately added the requirement of knowledge, it would seem quite arguable that had they meant to include intent at the time they were fortifying this clause, they would have specifically added intent, and intent is indeed to be found in Paragraph 2 of the Smith Act, the clause dealing with literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.389" offset="7104972">Well, but what about the reasoning of this Court in the Dennis case, when it was read into advocacy and organizing?</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.640" offset="7133915">I don't think it applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.356" offset="7144782">This Court went on the basis that it is part of the intrinsic nature of things that if you advocate a result, you intend it, or that if you organize a group to advocate a result that you intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.421" offset="7197027">But it does not follow, certainly does not follow nearly as automatically, that because you are a member of a group, you intend all of its purposes, legal or illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.851" offset="7258781">The -- the addition does not follow by the same logic as in the other clauses and here, we have a legislative history showing that the original models of the statute didn't even require knowledge and that Congress specifically added knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.520" offset="7329416">Now, those considerations apply in general also to the proposal from the Solicitor General that the requirement of party activity to be read in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.858" offset="7378840">But now, we come to the addition which I think is really the crucial point, because in addition to intent and activity, the Solicitor General wishes to read into this clause the sort of thing that is found at Page 45 of his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.093" offset="7459715">He quotes Justice Jackson's opinion in the Doud's case and then once -- goes on to say that ordinary conspiracy principles are playing irrelevant to membership in an organization where a membership entails such tightly disciplined quasi-military, deeply conspiratorial activities as those of the organization against which the Smith Act is directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.857" offset="7562846">Such membership obviously partakes of the concert of action, combination and acting together which characterize conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.189" offset="7608090">That indeed was also more or less the theory upon which the Court of Appeals went below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.798" offset="7638601">They -- the Court in substance equated membership in an organization with being a conspirator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.105" offset="7687816">Now, I do not think that this effort to save the constitutionality of the membership clause by reading all this material into it, can work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.658" offset="7737971">I have four reasons why I think this -- this effort must fail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.933" offset="7763153">The first one is a purely verbal one, but I think it is nonetheless important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.722" offset="7782275">It is all very well to try to save a statute by construing it so as to be constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.000" offset="7807352">It is entirely proper to work the construction in such a direction that constitutional questions aren't raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.179" offset="7840057">But it -- one cannot simply and totally rewrite the statute for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.483" offset="7869315">More for amusement than anything else, I have written out here how the statute would look if everything the Solicitor General wants to add into it were added into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.173" offset="7908080">And if there is very little resemblance to the original clause, that argument may be said to be formal, but there comes a point where formalities have some meaning and this is simply trying to add too much by way of implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.835" offset="7962728">But there are more important reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.758" offset="7978402">If we adopt the interpretation below and the Solicitor General's interpretation, and in substance, turn this membership clause into a conspiracy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.689" offset="8022079">We have rendered either that clause itself or the conspiracy provision meaningless surplusage and I would like to remind the Court that in 1940, when this clause was -- when this Act was passed, in fact, from 1940 to 1948, there was a separate conspiracy provision right in the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.311" offset="8104626">One was not at that time indicted under the general conspiracy statute, but under the conspiracy clause of the Smith Act itself and that has now been restored with the Smith Act by an amendment in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.317" offset="8156662">So that it seems to me incredible that Congress would have inserted the membership clause, merely to serve as sort of another version of a conspiracy charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2530.201" offset="10224201">Well, the introduction of a registration statute, that is to say an exposure statute, so to speak, into a field already covered by penal legislation raised obvious problems under the Fifth Amendment and the self-incrimination provision there, problems which this Court brushed in the -- in the subversive Control Board case which was sent back for reasons parallel to those discussed this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.364" offset="10332871">Now, John W. Davis, late John W. Davis pointed out to the Senate committee that this problem of self-incrimination was inherent in the registration notion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.343" offset="10392743">He pointed out in the Internal Security Act in one breath undertakes to punish people who try to overthrow the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.799" offset="10430568">The exact language of the penal provision is found in my brief at Page 48."</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.215" offset="10452198">It would be unlawful for any person to conspire, to perform any act which would substantially contribute to the establishment within the United States of a totalitarian dictatorship.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.244" offset="10492322">I believe no one has been, as far as I know, indicted under that yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.843" offset="10506742">But obviously, there would be danger that if one registers a Communist under Section 7 of the Act, one might inculpate oneself under this that I just read.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.322" offset="10552613">And John W. Davis pointed that out and it was on his urging that Section 4 (f) came into existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.251" offset="10584377">But in the form that it first came into existence, all he did was say that you couldn't be prosecuted under this other Section of the Internal Security Act by virtue of Communist membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.529" offset="10629517">Then, when it reached Congress, Senator Kilgore and the Senate, Congressman Cellar in the House both pointed out that Section 4 (f) in that form did not give any protection under the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.271" offset="10692420">And indeed, Senator Kilgore specifically referred to the membership clause of the Smith Act, saying that if you could be required to register as a Communist and then prosecuted for membership under the membership clause, it would clearly have a Fifth Amendment objection to registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.542" offset="10769533">And that unless you put in this provision, therefore, the registration mechanism would breakdown because the privilege would be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.105" offset="10803806">So, this 4 (f) and the reference to any other criminal statute which is thereupon added to it was put in there specifically with the membership clause in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.380" offset="10856887">Now, the Solicitor General says that the purpose of 4 (f) is to ensure that the membership clause will not be construed as punishing membership without knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.148" offset="10919999">Well, I've heard the story about hiring an elephant to step on a mat, but this is getting an elephant to step on a mat that isn't there because this membership clause already sets its membership with knowledge which is punishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.496" offset="10985305">And to think that Congress would have enacted an entire clause 10 years later to ensure that that would be not construed as membership without knowledge seems to me with quite -- quite impossible reasoning, quite impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.452" offset="11049148">It isn't as if there was any ambiguity in the membership clause by requiring knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.158" offset="11067956">It's there in so many words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.867" offset="11074853">There is certainly no need to enact another statute to ensure that knowledge would be left in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.171" offset="11100035">The result is that under the interpretation he contends for, Section 4 (f) is left without any place to operate, because even those other Sections of the Internal Security Act require knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.258" offset="11160430">So that if 4 (f) only protects Communists who do not know the purpose of the Party, it would have absolutely no effect under either of the membership clause or the other Sections of the Internal Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.647" offset="11213928">And what would it do to the Internal Security Act itself?This after all is a scheme of trying to get people to register, enforce -- enforcement of Communist registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.239" offset="11264293">But if 4 (f) only protects Communists who do not know the unlawful purpose of the Party, presumably, such ignorant Communists are the only ones who can be required to register, and any Communist who has guilty knowledge, guilty intent of any kind can plead self-incrimination and avoid registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.183" offset="11352064">It's quite beyond the purview of possibility that Congress intended any such consequence as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.440" offset="11373171">What they were trying to do is to ensure that Communist could be required to register under the Internal Security Act and to give them the protection that they needed to avoid the plea of self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.834" offset="11418728">Now, it may or may not be that Congress was successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.685" offset="11434088">It may or may not be that this provision is broad enough to give them that protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="3362.509" offset="13553455">The evidence given about the Communist Party here is subject to exact to the same infirmities that were the basis of Judge Hastie's dissent on the Mesarosh case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.484" offset="13605282">I had of course expected before that the Mesarosh case would have been discussed this morning so that I could shortcut it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.202" offset="13632136">But essentially, Judge Hastie thought that there was not sufficient testimony of imminent overthrow of the Government toward defining a clear and present danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.116" offset="13683858">Insofar as Scales himself is concerned, there is a place in the record where one of the Government witnesses, I believe it is Childs who testifies that he asked Scales how soon he thought this violent revolution is going to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.434" offset="13753135">And his answer was that, “Your daughter who is now one-year-old will be married under a socialist government.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.666" offset="13786049">Allowing the usual span, it would seem that the revolution was in the neighborhood of 20 or 21 years off.</text>

            <text syncTime="3436.270" offset="13848430">But questions were asked in the last two days about how soon this revolution has to come.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.530" offset="13873507">And in terms of Scales' personal intent, I think it is quite clear the Government is relying on evidence about a theoretical attitude of approval of the idea of revolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.044" offset="13915512">That in terms of imminence or incitement, he is talking about spans of 20 years and this is a very difficult thing to make into a clear and present danger.</text>

            <text syncTime="3478.092" offset="14015718">First, I'd like to call attention to one fact in regard to the statute of limitations, which was increased to five years in the summer of 1954, which was before the indictment in this case, which was in November of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.290" offset="14100564">So, the critical period would reach five years back in November of 1954, instead of the lesser period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.584" offset="14141733">While the matter is fresh in your minds, I'd like to briefly refer to Section 4 (f) on our interpretation of what the Congress did and try to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.489" offset="14193351">We have no dispute about the legislative history as set out in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.362" offset="14224802">We agree that the various Congressmen and Senators said substantially what was set forth in the briefs in regard to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.982" offset="14267329">But the problem of accepting the interpretation replaced by the petitioner upon this Section of the statute from the Internal Security Act of 1950, seems to us impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.268" offset="14320410">Because at the very time that the Congress was doing this, it was residing at considerable length and petitioner claim -- complaints about it, that this Communist Party was a terrible instrument engaged in a program for the overthrow of the Government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.391" offset="14408913">And then, by this device of 4 (f), the Congress at the same time was supposed to set up a provision which would emasculate a portion of the Smith Act under which they just debated and knew that prosecutions had been sustained by the courts in the Dennis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.613" offset="14501804">And they were to take out this membership clause entirely at the same time that they were going at lengths to condemn this party and its action to require registration.</text>

            <text syncTime="3625.452" offset="14605145">Well, I think the Congress was careful about the use of the expression "per se," and the problem was whether or not membership by itself was a vice for which a person could be convicted of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.680" offset="14678079">And they were trying to deal expressly with that problem and I think they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.347" offset="14704724">They said, “Neither the holding of office,” you'll notice that that goes farther than membership, it meant only membership in the Smith Act, “Nor membership in any Communist organization by any person shall constitute per se a violation of subsection (a) or (c) of this Section,” which means the Internal Security Act of 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.485" offset="14845262">And then, they added at a later date, "or of any other criminal statute."</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.333" offset="14872743">Now, it was recognized that they had taken care of the problem of whether or not the registration under the Internal Security Act of 1950 would be a crime under Sections (a) or (c) of these particular Act that they were passing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.317" offset="14956648">And then, it was -- the question was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.150" offset="14963963">Well, you don't do anything for the Smith Act by such language, and of course that's true.</text>

            <text syncTime="3725.967" offset="15007222">And the question was whether registration under this Internal Security Act of 1950 might in some way involve the membership clause of the Smith Act and to make it clear that "per se" membership would not be affected in any way, they added, "or of any other criminal statute."</text>

            <text syncTime="4958.049" offset="19935587">Clontz came back and discussed it these various studies at length with the Petitioner and he indicated his belief in them and his understanding and knowledge of those purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4976.129" offset="20007894">He then went into the whole question of the purposes of the Party with the witness trials who was a student in a university there and then discussed with him the desire and ambition of the Party, the purpose to infiltrate the trade unions and to occupy key positions in the unions in order to forward this revolution at the earliest possible date.</text>
            <text syncTime="5004.729" offset="20122311">This was discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5006.535" offset="20129520">Many urged that the witness Clontz test -- attend a meeting that a man by the name of (Inaudible) came down to New York by arrangement of the petitioner and this -- this man said in his talk, which the petitioner asked -- wants to attend -- the revolution in the United States was a certainty and a necessity and would -- would be modeled on the revolution that took place in Russia.</text>
            <text syncTime="5047.101" offset="20291793">He told Clontz that about the underground and the necessity of the underground and that the Party would have to carry on as an underground when the pressure became too great.</text>
            <text syncTime="5058.233" offset="20336306">He also said that he himself had gone underground and that Clontz was not to communicate to -- with him by telephone, telegraph or mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="5073.052" offset="20395551">Then he arranged for the organization of a school which was very clandestine and all the arrangements for it was held on a farm and everybody who attended became a student of this school under the direction of the petitioner, had aliases and they called each other by these various aliases rather than the names that they were known by.</text>
            <text syncTime="5103.146" offset="20515924">During this school, the various purposes of the Party were developed to some length, Marxism-Leninism, and the purpose to accomplish the Proletarian revolution as soon as possible and it was -- there was a demonstration in the presence of the petitioner by one of the leaders in which he pointed out how murder could be committed upon another person while in a picket line by the use of a pencil driving it through the throat or the chest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5142.271" offset="20672449">Discussion was had in some detail by the witness as to when the revolution could be expected, and whether or not they could expect any aid from the Soviet Union and he told the witness Clontz that the Soviet Union when the revolutionary time was ripe would come to the aid of the United States, or come to the aid of the Party, the Communist Party of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5184.470" offset="20841200">Then there was a list of names of persons in a Western Electric publication which set out in some detail the effect of the Communist Party's activities in the United States on -- in the United States and the industrial activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5206.689" offset="20930121">And it was very adverse to a Communist Party and in this there was a list of names at the end, and the Petitioner said to this witness that they should keep those names and when the right time came these people should be shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="5241.012" offset="21067421">The witness Childs was also advised that the trade unions where the school is the revolution and we think that this record demonstrates not only that the activity of this petitioner was for the Party generally, but also that he was trying to do what he could to accomplish the objects and purposes of the Party, and recruit members and aid in every way that he could to the accomplishment of the objectives of the overthrow of the government at the earliest possible date.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.313" offset="21260622">In addition to that there was the evidence of witnesses as to the purposes of the Party and its objectives and its objective to overthrow the government by violent revolution in considerable detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="5307.648" offset="21333974">A part of this by -- was by the witness and none has been referred to before.</text>
            <text syncTime="5321.111" offset="21387786">I'd like to briefly refer to the problem of the constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5333.652" offset="21437942">We rely to a considerable extent on the decision of this Court in the Dennis case, but we feel that the problems are different in the membership clause and the Court would certainly want to examine that with reference to the Dennis case and the problems that are involved in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5355.581" offset="21525713">As I stated, I think the statute fairly shows the requirement of knowledge and we feel that the intent should be included as mens rea in the ordinary construction of criminal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5370.317" offset="21584645">The issue as we see it is whether or not the Congress has the power to provide for the proscription of membership with knowledge and the intent to accomplish the objectives of the Communist Party in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5391.335" offset="21668760">And that there would be a presumption of the congressional right in the action that Congress take -- took being valid and should be given a great weight in this -- in the consideration of this Court of the problem before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5415.280" offset="21764472">Now the threat of the Communist Party was recognized by the Court in the Dennis case and also as we regarded in the Douds case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5424.613" offset="21801775">There have been numerous cases in which the problem of the Communist Party in its -- in the prosecution of various defendants has been conducted under Smith Act cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5437.751" offset="21854333">Some 20 cases and the juries in each instance have convicted the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="5445.011" offset="21883382">The trial judges have affirmed that on the evidence that was presented to them and the appellate courts have approved that in various instances up-to-date.</text>
            <text syncTime="5458.598" offset="21937716">We think that the situation during this trial was more aggravated than it was at the time of the Dennis proceeding in that there was during two-thirds of the time of this period involved in this indictment, the Korean conflict going on in which we had a large number of American casualties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5490.493" offset="22065298">We've also had as the Court recognizes Dennis the history of a number of governments that have fallen through the means of the Communist Party and its program of trying to secure a minority who would support its program and then secure control of the police of the country like in Poland, Czechoslovakia and then overthrow of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5522.473" offset="22193298">All of these things seem to us to demonstrate the danger and the present threat of the party as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="5529.964" offset="22223182">And here we have a functionary of the Party who was an officer, was an important person in the area of the Party activities in control of the Carolina's on behalf of the Party, and constant communication with it, actively recruiting new members, instructing them in the purposes of the party, its objectives and revolutionary designs and intending to do all that he had -- he could within his power to accomplish those objectives.</text>
