            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Keith, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Maxwell Keith</label>
            <text syncTime="7.233" offset="132263">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.270" offset="156400">The court below based its decision on asking itself one query, whether or not football is a team sport.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.897" offset="194957">In the Boxing case, this was not the query that was asked by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.925" offset="219094">This Court asked itself five questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.141" offset="231946">The first one was, “Had any court ever held that the business of boxing was outside the scope of the antitrust laws?”</text>
            <text syncTime="40.908" offset="267055">No court has ever held that football was outside the scope of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.112" offset="287848">The second question that this Court asked was, “Could the stare decisis help the boxing defendants?”</text>
            <text syncTime="59.106" offset="339780">And in stating that the Hart case show that to all businesses, athletic or otherwise that the question of interstate commerce was decided in the Federal Baseball case and that subsequent developments of facts in the use of interstate television and -- and radio transmission had affected and changed that the boxing people had used these interstate communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.416" offset="449076">And therefore, it was at we're within the scope of the Sherman Acts insofar as there was a question of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.695" offset="478124">And likewise the football defendants have used extensively interstate transmission of television and radio.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.581" offset="521697">Then this Court stated that Federal Baseball did not hold that all professional sports are outside of the antitrust laws so as to preclude boxing in the same statement would be applicable as to football.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.184" offset="588152">Then the Court asked, “What is the congressional intent involved?”</text>
            <text syncTime="126.380" offset="608841">And the Court noted that there were three -- three bills in the House and one bill in the Senate which would have exempted all professional team sports from the application of the antitrust laws that said that Congress had specifically refused to pass legislation and have said that the boxing defendants were asking of this Court the very thing which Congress had refused to grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.302" offset="712600">And it is submitted that football people are asking the same consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.697" offset="738200">They are asking this Court to exempt them but Congress specifically would have immunized this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.097" offset="767770">The question of public injury was also raised by the court below and this is of significance in the private antitrust action.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.223" offset="808312">There was no requirement under the plain wording of Section 4 of the Clayton Act, where a private party who alleged that the public was somehow injured by a violation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.124" offset="871842">Section 4 of the Clayton Act reads as follows, “That any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefore in any District Court of the United States in the district in which the defendant reside or was found or has an agent without respect for the amount in controversy and to recover threefold the damages by him sustained and the cost of suit concluding a reasonable attorney fees.”</text>
            <text syncTime="236.725" offset="1050311">This Court has never held that there was a -- added requirements to state a cause of action under the antitrust laws by a private party that he must allege that the public was adversely affected by the violation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.128" offset="1111855">And I think that this question goes to the very heart and nature of the private action.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.435" offset="1133066">The private action certainly is not a derivative right stemming from under the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.184" offset="1156159">And it is more than an ancillary action to aid the Government in prosecution of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.392" offset="1188968">It is a direct right granted by Congress to allow personal redress from those who inflict injuries on private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.620" offset="1237870">The congressional concern of this Act was with the redressing of those who were oppressed, who are ruined by the type of combinations and the type of monopoly power that the Acts in general condemn is respectfully submitted that the Court erred in dismissing our complaint as a matter of law and that we should be entitled to prove our allegations of a trial on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.042" offset="1347584">Thank you.</text>

          <heading>Argument of Philip Elman</heading>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="315.128" stopTime="318.912">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="315.128" offset="1363884">Mr. Elman.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_elman" startTime="318.912" stopTime="757.270">
            <label>Mr. Philip Elman</label>
            <text syncTime="318.912" offset="1379035">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.636" offset="1385932">United States is appearing in this case as amicus curiae escorting as according to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.233" offset="1412263">In this case, as in the Boxing case that came before the Court two terms ago, the question is whether the logic of the baseball decisions requires the holding that the Sherman Act also extends the exemption to other businesses involving sports.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.835" offset="1522709">The Court answered that question in the negative in the Boxing case and we think that the decision of this Court in that case is controlling here.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.462" offset="1565236">In our view, there are no legally significant differences between the business of boxing and between the business of football, legally significant, that is, in relation to the application of the Sherman Act, in relation to the coverage of the Sherman Act and in relation to the application of the doctrine of stare decisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.109" offset="1683832">In the Boxing case, the Court made it explicit that the baseball decisions dealt with baseball and with nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.464" offset="1729181">The Court made it clear that as to baseball, there was a unique set of circumstances which existed, which combined in their totality to justify giving baseball a special status under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.095" offset="1815803">We think the Court of Appeals in this case very aptly characterized the unique immunity of baseball under the Sherman laws -- Sherman law as really in the nature, a historical accident arising from the fact which is -- which exists as to baseball but which it does not exist as to any other sport, that there was a decision in this Court relating to baseball.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.820" offset="1942653">That it was on the books for 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.469" offset="1953207">That it was regarded by baseball as giving it a special status and on the basis that -- basis of that understanding, baseball grew and developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.410" offset="2001063">And that the Congress had not seen fit during that whole period to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.210" offset="2024260">Now, that was the unique, exceptional, extraordinary combination of circumstances that -- that the Court in the Toolson case found sufficient to justify giving baseball a preferred status.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.463" offset="2089253">Boxing undertook to rely on the logic of the Toolson ruling that it -- it argued that there could be no logical differentiation between one sport and another.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.960" offset="2175248">And that so far as the Sherman Act was concerned, that there could not -- there could not be an exemption for one business involving a playing of the sport in another business.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.805" offset="2222582">Now, that contention was considered by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.528" offset="2237524">It was -- it was accepted by two members of the Court but was not accepted by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.185" offset="2264064">It was rejected and we think that decision is the decision which should have been dispositive of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.909" offset="2298964">Now, in the -- in the face of the Boxing Club case, the respondents you read -- read their briefs, seemed to be abandoning the ground upon which the Ninth Circuit decided this case, namely as Mr. Keith pointed out, the Ninth Circuit thought that football was more like baseball than like boxing and therefore it should be given the exemption that -- that baseball enjoys.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.671" offset="2414007">The respondents don't make that argument, at least not in those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.379" offset="2428844">They say in their brief that it's inaccurate and confusing to speak of an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.367" offset="2460818">They concede that football is not exempt form the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.878" offset="2490911">They formulate their argument in somewhat different terms and it seems to us to reduce itself to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.666" offset="2529991">They say that football and baseball resembled one another in that in both sports, it's necessary to maintain a reasonable level of equality on the playing field that certain restraints on the freedom of players to contract have to be imposed because otherwise the rich clubs would sign up the better players and there would not be real competition on the playing field.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.145" offset="2667917">And they say further that those restraints of trade have been upheld by this Court as to baseball that on the merits those restraints are -- are not invalid, not unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.417" offset="2745031">And therefore as the matter of stare decisis that it's valid for the baseball business to use such restraints on its players, certainly valid for the football business to do the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.912" offset="2806993">Now as I indicated, that argument does not seem to be presented in the opinion of the Court of Appeals but dealing with it on its own intrinsic merits, we have some difficulties with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.403" offset="2884942">First of all, it may very well be as Mr. Keith has argued in his reply brief that football and baseball are not identical with respect to the facts that in football there's this player draft in which all the names of the college players are put into a hat and the -- and the professional football team which happens to pick out your name has the exclusive right to your services and if you don't sign with them, you can't sign with anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.072" offset="3031646">And there are other differentiations between football and baseball which can be argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.170" offset="3056097">But of course this case arises on the pleadings and none of that is in the record as a matter of surmise and speculations, I won't -- we won't rest our -- we and we can't properly rest our objections to the argument on -- on that ground alone.</text>

            <label>Justice Harold Burton</label>
            <text syncTime="757.270" offset="3132479">The reasonable reserve clause is not an issue here, is it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip Elman</label>
            <text syncTime="761.660" offset="3150033">Well, as I understand the respondent's argument, they -- they seem to be saying that as a matter of law, these restraints are reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.293" offset="3180544">Now, they find that in the baseball cases, we do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.230" offset="3196322">We don't see how the -- how the issue of reasonableness assuming it is in the case can be decided at this level.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.815" offset="3234670">Their -- there's their -- their allegations in this complaint Mr. Justice of -- of boycotting, of black-listing, of bans, there's a -- the -- the central allegation here, the gravamen of this complaint as -- as we read it is not the reserve clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.258" offset="3292453">The gravamen of this complaint was that these defendants were conspiring to monopolize football.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.495" offset="3325367">They were conspiring to destroy a rival league, the All-American Conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.452" offset="3353161">That as a result of this conspiracy, Mr. Radovich was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.386" offset="3372910">Now, the reserve clause is certainly an -- an aspect of that conspiracy, but we -- we don't see how one can accept the contention that simply because the complaint alleges a violation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.471" offset="3449292">And one of the means used in carrying out that illegal conspiracy or monopoly is the reserve clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.662" offset="3481997">It necessarily follows that the complaint has to be dismissed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip Elman</label>
            <text syncTime="854.472" offset="3521285">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.988" offset="3523375">We -- we -- we believe that in this case as in the Shubert case and the Boxing case, the complaint stated the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.753" offset="3554408">The case should have been permitted to go to trial, the District Court and the Court of Appeals should not have dismissed the complaint solely on the ground that they did, that the football business was governed by the decisions of this Court applicable to baseball and therefore no cause of action can be asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.256" offset="3648345">Now, if -- if the -- the allegations in this -- allegations to this complaint would certainly state the cause of action under the Sherman Act, if -- if it did involve football, if it involved any manufacturing or other enterprise and interstate commerce which was alleged had undertaken to monopolize the entire industry and for that purpose had agreed with others that anyone who worked for X manufacturing company which it wished -- which it was conspiring to destroy would be black-listed for his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.787" offset="3794526">There'd be absolutely no question if that was a -- a valid cause of action under the -- the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.964" offset="3819186">Now, we think getting back to the argument that the respondents make is the stare decisis in the baseball cases that their argument is in essence that the Federal Baseball case has -- has validated these restraints as to the baseball business.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.023" offset="3891493">And therefore, stare decisis requires that they be validated as to football.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.973" offset="3911241">But the Federal Baseball case didn't hold anything at all as to the legality or illegality of the means used to effectuate the conspiracy there.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.948" offset="3967143">Indeed Mr. Justice Holmes in his opinion for the Court said that in the view that the Court took to the case, it was unnecessary even to mention the means that were used.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.959" offset="4011238">The Federal Baseball case stands for a rather simple proposition of law not as to the meaning of the words "restraint of trade or commerce" in -- in the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.047" offset="4063587">The Federal Baseball decision is a decision as to the scope or the coverage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.057" offset="4083649">What it really -- what it construes is the word "commerce among the States."</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.014" offset="4103398">That's what the Federal Baseball case dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.864" offset="4114787">It's a holding as to the scope and the coverage of the Act and not a holding as to what is legal or illegal within the area that the Sherman Act covers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.271" offset="4156479">Mr. Justice Holmes in his opinion for the Court said that as to baseball, the essential thing was the playing of the game and that the only interstate aspects of baseball as alleged and -- and proved at that -- that in that case, on that record, were the interstate travel of players.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.887" offset="4250937">And the Court and Federal Baseball said that that travel which was the only thing relied upon to show interstate commerce was merely casual and was -- was a mere incident and that the playing was the essential thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.868" offset="4310810">So that the Federal Baseball case as a precedence stands for this proposition of law that a business is not engaged in trade or commerce under the Sherman Act where its dominant essential features are local and not commercial in the ordinary sense even though it may have some interstate features that are merely incidental and casual and trivial in relation to the business as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.151" offset="4435989">But the Court in Federal Baseball recognized that in each case you have to make an ad hoc determination as to whether the interstate features are -- are merely incidental as they were found to be in Federal Baseball or whether they rise to a greater magnitude because in the very next term, in the Hart-Keith Vaudeville Exchange case, the Court found that the allegations of interstate commerce there did rise to a greater magnitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.318" offset="4544658">So that the Federal Baseball case as a decision merely holds that when interstate commerce is alleged, you have to decide how much interstate commerce is alleged and to decide whether it's enough to bring into operation the provisions of the Sherman law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.474" offset="4617279">So that if in this case, if it were merely alleged by the plaintiff that the football that -- that he was a football player and that football games were played and that as a part of that game, it was essential for players to travel from one State to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.517" offset="4701393">And if the only interstate allegations in the complaint were travel of players so that they can play, we would say that as a precedent, the Federal Baseball decision is certainly a relevant precedent, whether there's been an -- an alteration in the climate of -- of construction, of -- of the concept of interstate commerce and so on, of course, being another question, but it would certainly be a relevant precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.669" offset="4806092">But in this case, the allegations of interstate commerce are so extensive that under many decisions of this Court leaves me no question at all that interstate commerce is shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.679" offset="4858128">So the -- the requirement of the Federal Baseball case is satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.458" offset="4873174">There's no necessity here to either distinguish or overrule the Federal Baseball case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.581" offset="4897729">The Toolson case, the other baseball decision was not a decision construing the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.473" offset="4933256">It was not a decision holding that the -- that the reserve clause or anything else about baseball was reasonable or necessary or it was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.259" offset="4976410">The Toolson case was not a decision even as to the scope of the -- of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.907" offset="4995009">It was a decision as to stare decisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.479" offset="5005249">It was -- it almost had in it the elements of res judicata that there had -- that since there had been a decision of the Court as to baseball, baseball had to be recognized as being in a special category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.942" offset="5075153">So that in its very terms, the Toolson case could deal with baseball and only with baseball because no other sport could bring itself within the first essential requirement of Toolson that there be a decision of this Court applicable as to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.821" offset="5154670">So that we -- we believe it's -- it's not necessary to elaborate the arguments here because we think that they're merely a -- a repetition of what was contended very earnestly and very fully in the Boxing case that it's true that in -- the boxing was an individual sport and football is a team sport.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.434" offset="5253099">But the fact that the football -- the fact -- the fact that -- that boxing was a sport of which only individuals engage was certainly not a relevant factor in -- in the Boxing Club case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.900" offset="5302941">It was the basis on which the Court decided the Boxing case was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.470" offset="5321226">It was something about the manner in which that the sport was conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.858" offset="5338781">The basis of the Boxing Club case was that an exemption from the Sherman Act is not to be given by the Court, to be given by Congress and that the special, unique status of baseball could not be shared by others -- other businesses simply because they happen to involve an athletic exhibition.</text>

            <label>Mr. Marshall E. Leahy</label>
            <text syncTime="2395.339" offset="9684720">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.056" offset="9703633">Now, I'd say at the outset that as far as football is concerned, this is quite a serious and fundamental case and that we approached it with that thought in line I want to assure the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.755" offset="9770402">I would like to say, at the outset that boil down to its bare essentials, this complaint involves a rather simple proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.372" offset="9832887">A player by the name of Radovich, he was under contract to the Detroit Lions, a team holding a franchise in Detroit and a member of the National Football League under the terms of his contract was required to report for the year 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.592" offset="9933720">He was told to report and instead of that, he admits in his verified complaint or rather in his complaint which is not verified that he negotiated with and concluded a contract with the team called the Los Angeles Dons that was a member of a rival football league and a salary that was approximately twice what he was receiving for the -- from the Detroit team.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.343" offset="10048763">He mentions in there that just before concluding his arrangements with the Dons, he contacted the owners of Detroit and said if you will pay me what this rival league will pay me, I will go back to Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.627" offset="10101844">And they told him that we have a contract with you and we respect -- we expect you to respect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.102" offset="10127757">So, Radovich ended up with the Los Angeles Dons and played with that team for two seasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.729" offset="10166314">Thereafter, for some reason which has not yet been explained in the pleadings or in the comments and that has been considerable comment outside the record, he decided that the All-America Conference was no longer the place for him and he made an effort to come back inside the structure of the National Football League.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.894" offset="10266937">Now, he admitted in his pleading that he was aware of the fact that at all the -- during all the time that he was playing for the National Football League, there was a rule that said that if any club has a contract with the player and that player signs a contract in violation of it and goes to another club, he is subject to certain penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.804" offset="10362546">That penalty in this -- under these particular circumstances happened to be and was a five-year suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.401" offset="10392952">Now, he claims in his complaint that he was injured because the National Football League with whom he had a contract did not take him back despite the fact that he had, in violation of the contract, go on with another team and played there for a couple years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.394" offset="10472991">Now, at the outset, I would like to clarify football's position on the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.717" offset="10506219">I think we stated it rather clearly in our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2613.292" offset="10556583">The complaint which I was going to get back to in a moment but I will resume just to pursue it to its prayer, in effect, says that because of this rule that was invoked against Radovich because he had decide a uniform player contract that have the rule in it and because the rule has a -- a sanction to it that if you violate it, you are going to be suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.833" offset="10662745">He has suffered an injury that those restraints are restraints in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act and therefore he is entitled to treble damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="2695.111" offset="10883845">Well, in that connection I think that we -- we are all in agreement that had Radovich alleged in his complaint that something that was done in radio and television injured him, he'd have some type of a cause of action of which he could involve radio and television.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.361" offset="10948838">The only purpose in a complaint of this type in bringing in radio and television is an obvious one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.270" offset="10976423">It's an attempt to play football in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.814" offset="10998680">Now, I would like to get back to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.940" offset="11015084">I'm going to discuss radio and television because they are an important part of this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.482" offset="11041311">Our position as far as the Sherman Act is concerned and the Clayton Act is that we contend that football has no exemption from those Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.096" offset="11079764">We have never made that contention and as a matter of fact we believe that football -- that baseball hasn't such an exemption either, nor any other sport.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.722" offset="11118216">I think that the Federal Baseball case did not say that the Act gave an exemption to baseball.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.410" offset="11156982">It's inconceivable to me that despite Toolson and despite Federal Baseball that baseball today could not combine with someone, for example, to restrain an interstate business such as radio and television and not be subject to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.213" offset="11220198">So, it's almost the same situation as exists in relation to labor unions under the certain circumstances this Court has held and other Courts despite specific language in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.565" offset="11269622">Labor unions under certain circumstances are subject to the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.150" offset="11291982">But that is not the same thing as saying that we feel that we should be involved in litigation of this type for a reason that we don't think that any of the things of which we are accused in this case restrain interstate trade and commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.916" offset="11367006">Now, I'd like to address the Court's attention to the charging part of the complaint which is found on page 9 of the record, paragraph IV and it is noticed that the paragraph numbered 12 ledges in statutory language that the defendants have violated Section 1 and 2 of the Act without specifying how or in what matter or making any statement other than the act that using the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.544" offset="11521546">Now, the pertinent part is found in 13 under the -- on the same page in which they -- the plaintiff alleges that to -- and hopes to set out and does set out, he says at the -- the last two lines, the substantial terms of which agreement and the means of the concert of action are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.147" offset="11607960">In other words, we have an unusual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.167" offset="11620080">In this complaint, the plaintiff sets out the means by which the so-called conspiracy was accomplished and what are the means which are found on the following page.</text>

            <text syncTime="2949.069" offset="11899695">Now, our -- our position, briefly, is that these elements that are alleged there were the identical elements that were found and were before the Court in considerable detail in Federal Baseball in 1922.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.204" offset="11992168">Now, counsel said that it was his understanding that Federal Baseball simply held that baseball was outside of the Act, without consideration of the -- of the inherent nature of the game and the internal operation of the game.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.496" offset="12081403">Now, I wish in that connection, and that's extremely important, to address the Court's attention to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.282" offset="12120482">Starting on page 15, we attempted to layout for the Court, the history of this Federal Baseball case and quoted on page 15, you will notice the comment by the trial judge in Federal Baseball, the District Court judge who held originally in Federal Baseball that they were subject to the Act and that they were a monopoly and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.396" offset="12240959">Then, the matter went to the Circuit Court and we turn to page -- to page 16 and we see considerable language extracted from the opinion of the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.189" offset="12296129">And in the interest of time I'm not going to read it but I wish the Court would read it because it -- it is essential in a consideration of this case to know just what the background of the ultimate decision was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.796" offset="12354539">I call the Court's attention to only three or four lines which are found right at the end of the quotation where it says, "It must be obvious that the restrictions thus impose."</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.416" offset="12401037">And I'm speaking of the same restrictions that of which, Radovich complains relate directly to the conservation of the personnel of the clubs and did not directly affect the movement of the appellee and interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.707" offset="12458193">Whatever effect if any they had was incidental and therefore, did not offend against the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.078" offset="12479718">Now, we drop down just below that to one little quotation from what Mr. Justice Holmes said when the matter reached the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.591" offset="12521723">He says, "The decision of the Court of Appeals went to the root of the case."</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.590" offset="12549726">And if correct, makes it unnecessary to consider other serious difficulties and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.879" offset="12574908">Now, to say that there was not before the Court in the original Federal Baseball case the entire operation of baseball, is not accurate and to go beyond that and to say that the ultimate end of that case in great part did not depend upon a consideration and a finding that baseball in -- in the operation of reasonable restraints that relate to the conservation operation of baseball itself, namely, reserve clause, uniform contract and that type of regulation are restraints which are reasonable because they promote rather than restrain competition among the members of the league.</text>

            <text syncTime="3245.285" offset="13084505">Our position is that the features of which Radovich complains in this action are the very features this -- this Court have before many years ago in Federal Baseball and held to be restraints, lawful and proper and having a proper and lawful business purpose and not restraints upon interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.804" offset="13178546">There is nothing in the context to the Radovich complaint that was not before the Court in Baseball.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.447" offset="13205191">Now, the significance that we put on that, I'd like to explain, you might say, “Well, what -- what does -- what does that mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.033" offset="13239463">What's the effect to that?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.733" offset="13246255">Now, this is our attitude on that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.294" offset="13256600">That decision remained unchallenged for about 30 or 35 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.331" offset="13292648">The Toolson or I should say -- represent by saying along came Gardella versus Chandler.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.077" offset="13323682">And in the -- in that case, there was some doubt cast by the Circuit Court on the question of what this Court might do as far as baseball is concerned if it reached it under more modern circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.095" offset="13379793">The case never went any farther.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.527" offset="13385435">It was sent back and disposed off on some basis unknown to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.852" offset="13406751">As a result of that case, it's a matter of record that within a few months we have the Radovich complaint on file, within a few months of the Gardella case and other cases that have since reached this Court, the Baseball followed that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.170" offset="13476028">This Court have before it, the Toolson case, directly on the proposition of -- point to modern circumstances, radio and television and the other aspects that are now in the game, 30 or 35 years later require this Court to review this matter in the light of baseball in 1955 rather than baseball in 1922.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.589" offset="13589713">And the Court said as -- if I can interpret it correctly, that because of certain unusual circumstances, they didn't feel that the matter called for review that there was a unique set of circumstances involved and what were those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.000" offset="13663378">Circumstances were that for 30 or 35 years, baseball had been allowed to develop on the basis that Federal Baseball was the law as far as baseball that they had made certain large expenditures in developing their operation, their farm systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.786" offset="13734536">And to -- for this Court at this time to now decide that they were wrong 25 or 30 years ago would have a very drastic effect upon baseball.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.253" offset="13784377">Now, if you look at the Toolson complaint and compare it to the Radovich complaint, there isn't any comparison in respect to the allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.324" offset="13836622">The Toolson complaint has allegations in it that far exceed the charges against the defendants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.647" offset="13873925">Now, there was another facet that was involved in that decision and that was to the effect that Congress had had certain bills before in which they had conceded the question of whether something shouldn't be done legislative-wise as a result of this mulltiplicity of litigation that was arising now in baseball and the Federal Baseball case that should we do something about it and all through that report runs this reserve clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.289" offset="13996492">The reserve clause this and the reserve clause that and inherited baseball as a reserve clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.528" offset="14021465">You could spend an hour reading it and practically every page talks about these facets, the things that are essential and fundamental to baseball.</text>

            <text syncTime="3511.123" offset="14147897">Now, as I understand it from reading the newspapers, in baseball, any man who goes in to organize baseball is a free agent.</text>

            <text syncTime="4041.424" offset="16269040">I say that they had a right to rely that if they followed the identic pattern as baseball as normal business people if they model themselves as an athletic group, leagues, regular scheduling, players on the contract, uniform contracts, commissioners, rules and regulations all of -- all the same layout.</text>
            <text syncTime="4066.584" offset="16369664">What -- how could anyone honestly say that instead of relying on Federal Baseball, they should have relied on Hart?</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.148" offset="16403937">Now, all Hart said was, “Here are a lot things in the -- in the theatre business, a lot of restrictions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.136" offset="16439881">And they said well, those are all proper because we have a local exhibition.</text>

            <text syncTime="4090.561" offset="16465586">They didn't make any effort as I read their complaint to show that those restraints that were involved in the Hart case were lawful and necessary to the operation of that business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4101.314" offset="16508635">But football already had the baseball case behind it where these things have been held to be reasonable and proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.899" offset="16534967">And then for 30 years, they developed an operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4111.456" offset="16549177">Now, we have a lot of players on the contract and everyone of these players that's on the contract that has some little court in his background has it -- if this matter's reversed and set back, we're going to be in exactly the same position that baseball was in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.053" offset="16623574">Now, I can impress on the Court too much if they -- they should give serious consideration to what would businessmen organizing a football league in 1921 which is the language of the complaint and which is not in dispute, what would they have done?</text>
            <text syncTime="4148.420" offset="16697031">Here is a football war going on that was well known to everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.693" offset="16714167">It was a fight between the old Federal League and the Major Leagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="4156.706" offset="16730154">And in that case, you had a team, Baltimore claiming that they had forced them out of baseball and they ended up with a team and no one to play.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.630" offset="16769860">Those were the facts in the Federal Baseball case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4169.975" offset="16783235">So, these people say, “Well, it seems obvious to me as a businessman that if we model ourselves on baseball and confine ourselves to the same operational layout we're within the thinking and the principle of the Supreme Court.”</text>

            <text syncTime="5159.434" offset="20741099">And that face of the case rises on the basis of the record which we respectfully submit consists at this point of the plaintiff's complaint only, a far cry from any of the very important -- and heretofore discussed subjects on this hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5182.747" offset="20834408">The plaintiff's complaint was characterized by the court below in a very simple manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5189.574" offset="20861680">The Court said that he was a football player that tried that -- that broke his contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5195.235" offset="20884355">And then the Court said succint paragraph which makes the case and this is really Mr. Radovich's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5201.931" offset="20911104">Eventually, he wanted reemployment by the Detroit Lions or by other football organizations of the National League.</text>
            <text syncTime="5210.680" offset="20946108">But he says up to the filing of -- of his complaint, he could find no further employment as a football player with teams affiliated with the National League because when he joined the Los Angeles Dons, he broke his contract with the Detroit Lions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5227.750" offset="21014340">So we don't have a case which involves anything at all except an embittered player who broke a contract or jumped it in plain language and wants to go back to work for the same people that he was working for before.</text>
            <text syncTime="5243.482" offset="21077347">The court below says on this face of the case distilled plaintiff's allegation is really that there was a conspiracy to eliminate football leagues not affiliated with national particularly another league called the All-America Conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="5260.562" offset="21145579">The alleged methods would be control of players by the reserve clause and black-lists.</text>
            <text syncTime="5267.070" offset="21171702">Now, in this respect, the Court says this and I've eliminated several unnecessary words which do not change the sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5273.687" offset="21198137">We doubt that the alleged means is legally sufficient to support a conclusion that these means were calculated to prejudice the public or unreasonably restrain interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5287.757" offset="21254353">And the Court says we failed to discover again eliding some inconsequential words.</text>

            <text syncTime="5306.557" offset="21329586">Now, what the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said is that the plaintiff Radovich alleged in subparagraphs A, B and C appearing on page 10 of this record that the National Football League just within its own components adopted a rule that says that every player had to sign the same contract and that if he broke his contract without just cause or excuse, they wouldn't employ him again.</text>
            <text syncTime="5332.702" offset="21434180">We must bear in mind that the National League is not like an association of manufacturers and football is the National League.</text>
            <text syncTime="5343.296" offset="21476603">The league itself is the entity comprised of teams who compete with other -- each other upon the playing field so that each of the teams in effect are partners.</text>

            <text syncTime="5405.901" offset="21726960">You see, all of these other things that have been debated thus far in this hearing is a magnifying process of a simple, plain, everyday, situation into something which is -- which it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5421.342" offset="21788714">If three people own a manufacturing concern, if counsel, the three of us own a manufacturing concern and we have a secretary who without any reason at all quits her job, if I agree with my three partners who own the plant that we won't hire her back again, certainly, there is no interstate commerce involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5442.284" offset="21872515">There is no Sherman Act violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5444.359" offset="21880769">There is nothing involved, just a simple, honest, plainly understood everyday event, namely, an agreement of partners who own a business not to reengage somebody who quits without an excuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="5457.612" offset="21933850">That's all there is in this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="5459.471" offset="21941269">And that's why the Court of Appeals said that the plaintiff's complaint indicates no connection between competition with the -- of the National Football League with the All-America Conference and that without allegations connecting it, it cannot be presumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5475.855" offset="22006784">Accordingly, the Court said since what is involved in a Sherman Act case is an undue or unreasonable restraint upon competition which is the public injury that our Brother was discussing earlier today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5491.230" offset="22068328">The undue or unreasonable restraint upon competition is what -- is the public injury that's involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5497.362" offset="22092779">The Circuit Court of Appeals said in quoting the Feddersen case, that since the mere adoption of a -- a group of people who own a business of a rule that they won't take back their employees who quit without excuse since that's all that's involved, there's no allegation of an undue or unreasonable restraint upon competition and no Sherman Act violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5520.364" offset="22184835">There's no public injury in the words of the Feddersen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5523.401" offset="22196955">There's no undue restraint and accordingly in that face of the -- of the case in that kind of a discussion, we are not involved with whether baseball is football or football is interstate commerce or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="5536.919" offset="22251081">It's a simple everyday occurrence of a disloyal player who broke his contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5543.859" offset="22278771">Now, if Your Honors take that case and for some reason undoubtedly, academically sound or legally appropriate, use that case as a means or in -- in a way which will result in a trial with the enormous expense upon these defendants for the proof of what goes on in the football system, for all of the delay, the harassment, the chaos in the Football League, the league utterly may well utterly be destroyed because the impact upon the investments in this business, the possible liabilities of every player with a uniform contract to be involved in a case which is in essence nothing but the claim of a disgruntled, embittered player who alleges nothing in his -- in his complaint in any manner related to the enforcement of the Sherman Act, in any other way than if my own secretary quit her job and that my partners agree with me not to take her back again.</text>
            <text syncTime="5613.656" offset="22557968">Now, to -- to go off on boycotts, bans, black-listing or anything else is to fly in the face of what a football league is because no football game can be presented to the public unless with -- it is within a framework of a league.</text>
            <text syncTime="5630.817" offset="22626617">The public must be interested in the contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5633.990" offset="22639365">The respective championship and the -- the Football League isn't a combination of manufacturers or cement workers or plasterers or the Football League is an entity and it's that entity, that single entity without combination with anybody alleged by the plaintiff himself that has adopted a rule that says that he -- he can't come back to work for them when he broke his contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5662.101" offset="22751796">Now, Your Honors have for many years consistently held that the generality and the depth and -- and of vagueness of the language of Sections 1 of Sherman Act is comparable to constitutional provisions with the Court -- result of duty upon the Courts to interpret it and then interpreting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5682.084" offset="22831731">The courts for -- for many years, has said that the mere restraint upon commerce is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="5688.142" offset="22855973">It must be an unreasonable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5690.366" offset="22864854">And certainly, no person may obtain the benefits of litigating in a federal court unless he does what Your Honors have heretofore held he must do, state or allege or claim an unreasonable restraint upon commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5706.056" offset="22927548">There is not one word in this complaint on the part of the plaintiff whereby he alleges that the uniform contract is an unreasonable restraint upon commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5717.090" offset="22971747">Now, it's true that's a technical pleading point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5720.240" offset="22984286">But nevertheless, before a man may or before a man may -- may state a case or have his case heard, he should be required to include within the framework of his complaint, the essential allegations of a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="5735.004" offset="23043427">And if I may say most respectfully to require the defendants to bring on their proof with the delay and the enormous expense involved when the plaintiff hasn't even done which Your Honors have required in every case that I've read that's come out of this Court, namely, that any restraint upon commerce must be an unreasonable restraint to create a cause of action or to state a claim for relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="5971.711" offset="23990209">Most trial lawyers as you know have somewhat of an objection to letting cases be disposed of, summary proceedings simply on some minor insufficiency in the allegations on the complaint of --</text>

            <text syncTime="5984.679" offset="24042036">We submit, if Your Honor, please, this is not a minor insufficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="5987.799" offset="24054575">That the real basis of this complaint is nothing but the action of a disgruntled player who seeks to bring into complete scrutiny with all of the enormous hazards of liabilities and enormous expenses and delays and all the time that it would take of everybody involved when he really hasn't got a claim at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6010.780" offset="24146526">And for the Court to permit him to do that when he hasn't sought, leave to state anything more than he started out with in the face of a perfectly reasonable, academically sound decision of a Circuit Court of Appeals would seem to us most respectfully to be not required in any degree or sense of fairness to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6032.640" offset="24233984">We respectfully submit that the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals was correct on that face of the case (Inaudible)</text>

            <label>Mr. Maxwell Keith</label>
            <text syncTime="6043.733" offset="24278288">May I state but I doubt if it's the question of time harassment and expense that will deter or bothers the respondents in having this case put to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6055.646" offset="24325935">It is a fact that there has been extensive pretrial discovery and we shall prove the three main elements of our cause of action, which may not be limited on a motion to dismiss, to a reserve clause issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="6069.519" offset="24381419">We will prove that we have been injured as part of a plan to rule -- to ruin the All-America Conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="6075.893" offset="24406915">This conference admittedly is not a constituent member of the National Football League but was engaged in a trade war with the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="6086.666" offset="24450069">We will show that the agreements, the divisional alliances between the Pacific Coast League and the National Football League had nothing to do with the promotion of competition on the playing field but were simply agreements not to compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="6101.677" offset="24510046">It was simply agreements to give nationwide sanction to the rules and regulations of the National Football League and were simply the means of (Inaudible) group power to eliminate this league.</text>
            <text syncTime="6114.988" offset="24563336">And in the sense, the Toolson case has no application to our cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="6121.234" offset="24588309">There hasn't been a trade war in the baseball industry since 1915.</text>
            <text syncTime="6125.927" offset="24607117">There was no attempt to state that interstate commerce was affected by the elimination of the competitor in the Toolson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6133.229" offset="24636270">There was no attempt to show that there was a desire for Toolson services which was -- you know which was -- which was prevented from enforcement by a boycott and we have those practice present in our -- in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6153.569" offset="24717667">As our second element we shall prove that there was a group boycott between divisional affiliates who had no competitive relationship with each other on the playing field.</text>
            <text syncTime="6166.486" offset="24769285">Our complaint establishes that the National Football League had no constituent members in San Francisco where the petitioner was requested to play by the Clippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6178.193" offset="24816097">We will show that as to the National Football League there would be no problem of the enforcement of the reserve clause between constituent members that he played for the San Francisco Clippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6190.414" offset="24864998">They never met on the playing field.</text>
            <text syncTime="6193.256" offset="24876387">As to the Pacific Coast League, we will show that what for this divisional affiliation, he would have aided and strengthened their league if they really wanted to become a major competitor to the National Football League.</text>
            <text syncTime="6207.482" offset="24933334">And we will show that this -- that this divisional affiliation as set forth in the answers of the respondents caused the relation of a traitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="6216.619" offset="24969801">And I say this supression and discrimination establishes matters which are necessarily under the antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6224.122" offset="24999894">Thank you.</text>
